"No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn't that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,
you must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from
the first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took
leave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his
coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected
of robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,
though his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my
suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into
custody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a
policeman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled
it into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness
that it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain
you a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was
sullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested
itself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence
of his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to
where she had gone."I'm better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She's
always a-whinin' and complainin', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can't
always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have
some spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus
ain't much like yours.If I speak rough to
her, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that's the best way.""Why, you're not half a man, you ain't.Do
you want to know what I'd do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I'd beat her till she couldn't see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked
as if he was quite capable of it."You haven't got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,
turn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the
proposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he
was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from
using it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced
vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had
she been Bill's wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have
been bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our
plans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I'd kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain't no
use considerin' that.""Well, I'm glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind
of it.""What do you think of that chap that's puttin' us up to it?""I don't like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain't much for the risk we run.""If we don't find more in the safe, we'll bleed him when all's over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and
desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the
danger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and
though both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in
general escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at
the close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the
opening of the safe comparatively easy."It's a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There'll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don't kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and
they'll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we're
gone, but we'll tie him so he can't give the alarm."Obey
orders, and I'll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had
been a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated
him for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical
strength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in
his present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the
contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming
rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and
he fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to
withstand the burglars single-handed."What's the use of callin' in the police?""It's only two men,
and old Jack is a match for two.""You're a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as
strong as you are.He's broad-shouldered and
big-chested.""I ain't afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there's another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were
admitted about eight o'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when
necessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,
and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken
in the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part
not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to
do as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o'clock, and by the light of a
dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm
and dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in
making tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I'll do it myself.The word agreed with the information
they had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the
janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no
suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the
establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave
yourself, and we'll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I'm agreed.""It'll look as if I was helpin' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won't know it.When all is over we'll tie
you up, so that it will look as if you couldn't help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering
him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:

"I'm a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack's fidelity was
very cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting
the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which
he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy
approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as
he was crouching before him, exclaiming:

"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,
was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You'll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,
and, in spite of old Jack's efforts to keep him down, he forced his way
up.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden
attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack's life was
likely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements
appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in
hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the
heads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the
lantern, cried, exultingly:

"If I am an old idiot, I've got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the
fight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper
here; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn't he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn't enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I
wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led
us to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in
the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he
carried away.""That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then."Burglar," said old Jack, indifferently."There's an
old saying, 'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.'Your
cursing won't hurt me any.""If my curses don't my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won't have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to
come, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I've
only done my duty, and I'm ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money
labeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts
and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near
success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term
of years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said
amen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he
opened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already
know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel
contained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take
notice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot
carried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in
the background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of
defeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for
Dan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has
got a better head-piece than any of us.""You've done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I
have a difficult case I'll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I'll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I
wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the
heels by a boy like you--that's enough to make me sick.""You've said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way
to the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten
years' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found
on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this
statement fell to the ground before Dan's testimony and that of Bill's
wife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his
just deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *

On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan
into the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for
the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this
burglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand
dollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been
a heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that
the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something
left.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed
to Dan.This was the way it read:


     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Sandra moved to the hallway.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When
he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,
Dan."But, sir, you don't mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved
for us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay
you?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,
isn't it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two
pieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don't draw upon it
unless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you
should still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,
to understand book-keeping."Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,
of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars
through a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be
appropriated to Althea's dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,
while she always looked forward with delight to Dan's return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child's companionship, and found the
task of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan
was absent all day on business."I don't know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said
one day."I don't want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when
for your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you
as well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are
others who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy
home life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was
to remain with them.If so, how could that
mother voluntarily forego her child's society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer
suggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so
long as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan's income, and the large sum he had on interest,
would have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision
made for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging
in a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of
lessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I
think from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don't know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don't dance, or if I am
awkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don't want to appear at disadvantage when he is
around.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the
part of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don't want to be a
wall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn't
hold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt's eyes rested
with pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn't see
it."He selected a
fashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it
might secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of
clothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a
quick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon
made him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the
young ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as
good-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as
much credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting
himself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was
dressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He
passed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and
rang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air
showed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:

"Gentlemen's dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where
several guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went
up stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair
before the glass."That's my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn't at once look at
the new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and
remarked, superciliously:

"I didn't expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you'll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended
and partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don't mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable
guest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I
sell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom's place
in front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well
as himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not
find fault.He would have liked
to see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him
that an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly
puzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your
mind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the
astonished Tom."I don't see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I've got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you
needn't feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn't have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,
changing his tone."You'll be so awkward, you know.You don't know any one except Miss
Rogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would
accept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won't presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,
hastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can't give you any
attention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn't want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall
surprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the
party was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,
cordially."I had no idea he would look
so well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the
master of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his
intense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place
in the quadrille."I suppose he
never attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his
awkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to
dance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn't dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching
said:

"Tom, there's Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers
were to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,
smiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,
determined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There's no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I
am afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that
rudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than
Dan's movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he
was thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in
disappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been
altogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan's dancing, and,
being herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little
disagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he
mentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it's easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by
way of consolation."He won't venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next
polka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the
young hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was
led by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the
first dance.""Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to
dance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing
with her, and you won't.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no
other young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming
smile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly
to Tom's amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social
standing, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom's further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as
in the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose
acquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as
much at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn't know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,
and so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best
pupil."That's fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may
become a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don't think he's very likely to do
that.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any
young gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to
dress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to
support," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said
the young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy
in his position dresses as if he were rich one can't help noticing it.""I am sure he can't be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth's
dancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don't care
whether he's poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the
same grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because
their families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in
obtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an
occasion as this?""I am sorry you don't like it, but I never saw a more forward or
presuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt.""I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with
dignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with
a common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite
distanced in the race.About twelve o'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It
is pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we
shall meet at Miss Carroll's party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you'll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with
a sneer.But Dan's dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling
misfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother's room.He had
promised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the
party.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering
attentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened
the door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother
advanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"

And Mrs.You don't mean she is----"

He couldn't finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been
stolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the
particulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader
more, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the
scene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of
London sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,
whom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be
mistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don't know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long
delay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must
be firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her
father, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,
bequeathed her by her poor mother.John went back to the hallway.He can have no possible claim to it;
for, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was
divorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:

"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,
you may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her
visitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we
met, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking
so well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,
abruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you
would have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near
relationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always
false.The slender tie that
connected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking
badinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never
more mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you
flatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don't think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don't think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,
contemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,
but she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was
a coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit
his child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she
asked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my
child.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the
gaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child's guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You
ill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you
shortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was
her last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above
all, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to
keep it.""You poisoned my wife's mind against me," he said."But for your cursed
interference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my
sister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a
divorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of
that.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and
forfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I
recommended.""I didn't come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,
Harriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,
perhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to
your good or bad opinion."I don't recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I
will answer you.He appeared to be occupied with
some thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don't doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will
treat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing
to leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand
dollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of
this sum.Give me half her income--say
three thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further
trouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs.Daniel moved to the garden."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard
to your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my
sister's fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her
money.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the
child, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,
too, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better
reconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,
contemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,
"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who 'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea's mother.Julia
Belmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own
right, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's
clerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a
case is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the
hatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and
Julia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred
thousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her
consent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her
issue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position
immediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am
out of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,
indulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,
to the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to
ill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted
away, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's
property.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her
child's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to
this unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but
the principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,
John."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,
angrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never
to be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted
one hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not
very profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent
this outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all
restraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his
treatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute
proceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of
pneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the
care of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her
to find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had
come into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and
follow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered
maledictions upon her."I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between
his teeth."I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh
and blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist
him in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,
but often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had
belonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my
child?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don't _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently
was suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,
and was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said
Hartley, plausibly.She is living
here in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich
woman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was
believed by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his
search, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into
her hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had
no difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her
co-operation."If it's no harm you mean my
missus----"

"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand
a father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and
number where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated
it to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I'll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my
sweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan
and his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring
suspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,
luckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,
and furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who
went in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated
to gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but
always accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there
would be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'
end.Mordaunt chanced to need some small
article necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might
indeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,
which he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to
disappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in
the morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the
direction of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she
often traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,
for the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five
minutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession
of her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not
know me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel
anxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand
your feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew
up before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the
bell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the
bell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into
my house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the
little girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been
taken to his home."I'm afraid mamma's been killed," she said."No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl
and hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt
would come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the
fulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the
carriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside
her, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of
a carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and
she is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the
servant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in
truth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had
modified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the
child precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old
enough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work," said Hartley to
himself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in
better business than poisoning my child's mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly
to occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of
the lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party
to-night.""And he won't be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home
till supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea
became restless."I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has
delayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South
Ferry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their
crossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into
which he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already
begun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in
vain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up
it will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection
would have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by
such means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or
natural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping
child as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes
upon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled
outlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby
and neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name


         DONOVAN'S

     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of
them thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at
small tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and
was suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others
engaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,
and unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man
with reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one
serviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There
were two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the
glance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from
his mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few
days or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl
should be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than
this."I have little time for explanation, but I may
tell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get
hold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my
own child.Is there no way of getting up stairs
except by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he
clambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his
better-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,
evidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed
from a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?""It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"
said Hartley."Here's a week's pay in advance," and he took out two
five-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I'll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said
Hartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there
may be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small
room, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise
she might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do
to let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from
whom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will
communicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the
track, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of
security."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave
you to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I'll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,
red-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the
child as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no
trouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It's a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced
eye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor
saloon.However, it is none of
my business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and
gave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will
find that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it
worth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that
my interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a
letter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand
dollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of
which he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further
molestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in
sound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,
and she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in
surprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper
and dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I'm your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but
you've come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,
ready to cry."It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.""Don't you go
on talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any
breakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I'll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place
she found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had
once belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"
said Mrs."I won't put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,"
said the woman."Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name."That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid
you're gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,
and that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own
identity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that
there was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and
deny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,
after a pause."If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you
some breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments
of the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror
with a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in
order to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set
the table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a
man to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a
fairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a
creature."I don't want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if
fascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little
gals--'specially when they're my own.""Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,
thinking it a good joke."Well, it'll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we'll see
what the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little
bread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house
was responsible.When the meal was over she said:

"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,
and you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they
could be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed
at the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan's face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what's best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,
and brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you'll feel it if you don't stop your howlin'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you'd come to your senses," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as
she cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and
hopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,
and wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which
at once drew the attention of Mrs."I can't help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip
with which her husband had threatened the child."I'll give ye something
to cry for.""Oh, don't--don't beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won't unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart
sinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure
I can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged
sun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the
house, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her
supplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on
her way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her
sorrow."Shure it's my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink
which prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become
afraid of her new guardians.She felt
sure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was
Dan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could
hardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it
necessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her
recovery."I'll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake
thinking of her, for it won't do any good."I didn't know how much I loved the dear child
till I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her
again."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up
bright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won't have any time, Dan.Rogers,
telling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is
to be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not
feel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how
the little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your
mother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to
be of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and
interview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was
absent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying
a gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between
Eighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His
courage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that
a child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would
have saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan
to himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been
unobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve
as he noted our hero's inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don't think
you'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:

"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite
the house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly
afterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man's appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I
believe his hair was brown"--Hartley's was black."I am sorry I can't
remember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab
drove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,
'Drive to Harlem.'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right
track."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me
know," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite
yours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to
deceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of
your search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive
intelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look
after you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while
you are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait
three weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had
one source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet
Vernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be
seriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse
to the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He
did not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of
success should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his
child's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western
adventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of
character, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a
hazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some
genuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of
shares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a
hundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a
corresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the
overtures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious
investigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and
how well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was
so satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in
train.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful
accomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously
raised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man
from Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as
collateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without
a doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars
between them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary
assistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It's a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he
thought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is
likely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand
of her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a
Cunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and
decided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good
advantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for
sale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting
surprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed
upon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the
right direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it
was probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall
into the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on
Broadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an
appearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking
glance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon
him.He had sent him to Harlem,
purposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do
with the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he
resolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope
of obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as
Hartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an
Italian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with
some difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no
Italian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play
"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon
qualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered
velvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,
and then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit
he kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street
dress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time
sang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter
upon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him
as to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One
day he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and
gave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,
signora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him
understand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn't understand English.Here is some more money
for you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some
suspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the
conductor."Seems to me you're flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don't understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to
her that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn't object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three
feet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be
in character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an
accompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among
them Hartley."I can't agree with you, ma'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him
money to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful
language.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"
said Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn't suspect me; I am glad of
that."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of
course, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay
another installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had
carried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent
distance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not
penetrated Dan's disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss
to understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don't, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing 'Viva Garibaldi?'"Here, take
this money, and don't sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan
rapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any
farther.Looking about him, his eye fell
on a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of
that man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump
on the car and find out where he goes."Daniel went to the bathroom.Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you
report to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is
sharp, and won't lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something
to do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way
of filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received
from fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will
become an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached
Dan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they
would not be overheard."You've made a fortun' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in
surprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan's.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily."No, he didn't call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money
and give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn't.Then I
sat down for a minute, makin' believe I was tired.They looked at me,
but I didn't appear to be noticin' 'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan's daughter, he feared, not the
child he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan's
hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn't tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I'll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I
could find it myself, but I can't take any chances.And don't say a word
about what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I'd be willing to help you for nothing.I've got a little sister
about her size.If anybody stole her, I'd mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That's the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan's, only a few
rods away.You'd better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and
that would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it'll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began
to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One
of them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it
prudent to understand too well."His hair doesn't look like that of most Italians."I'd know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his
violin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both
had evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for
Althea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking
as an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don't want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for
him."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not
seem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but
made bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear
than the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a
German air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you're an Italian wonder, and it's Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you're a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to
stand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a
child's shrill scream directly afterward."Something's happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse
for running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this
condition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an
upper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in
hand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,
grasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing
stertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman's taken too much," said Donovan.he
shouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It's the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can't you drink dacent like me?Shure it's a purty
example you're settin' to the child.Ain't you ashamed to lie here in a
hape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea's attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan's
disguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past
Donovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it's my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

For Young People

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an
English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.Daniel moved to the hallway.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._


     +Facing Death+; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit.A Tale of the Coal
     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._


     +Tom Temple's Career.+ By HORATIO ALGER.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his father
becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a penurious insurance
agent.Though well paid for keeping the boy, Nathan and his wife
endeavor to bring Master Tom in line with their parsimonious habits.The
lad ingeniously evades their efforts and revolutionizes the household.As Tom is heir to $40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance
until by an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds.He leaves Plympton village to seek work in New York,
whence he undertakes an important mission to California, around which
center the most exciting incidents of his young career.Some of his
adventures in the far west are so startling that the reader will
scarcely close the book until the last page shall have been reached.Alger's most fascinating style, and is bound to
please the very large class of boys who regard this popular author as a
prime favorite.+Maori and Settler+: A Story of the New Zealand War.With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of the war with
the natives.Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous lad, is the
mainstay of the household.Atherton, a
botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for
boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to say anything in his
praise, for the youth of America regard him as a favorite author."+Carrots+:" Just a Little Boy.With
     Illustrations by WALTER CRANE."One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our
     good fortune to meet with for some time.Carrots and his sister are
     delightful little beings, whom to read about is at once to become
     very fond of."--_Examiner._

     "A genuine children's book; we've seen 'em seize it, and read it
     greedily.Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly
     appreciate Walter Crane's illustrations."--_Punch._


     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._


     +A Jaunt Through Java+: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred
     Mountain.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their trip across the
island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.In a land where
the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large; where the rhinoceros and other
fierce beasts are to be met with at unexpected moments; it is but
natural that the heroes of this book should have a lively experience.Hermon not only distinguishes himself by killing a full-grown tiger at
short range, but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the
reader, and so deftly has Mr.Ellis used his material that there is not
a dull page in the book.The two heroes are brave, manly young fellows,
bubbling over with boyish independence.They cope with the many
difficulties that arise during the trip in a fearless way that is bound
to win the admiration of every lad who is so fortunate as to read their
adventures.+Wrecked on Spider Island+; or, How Ned Rogers Found the Treasure.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from love of
adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,
explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy.While
thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck
submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize
the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a
matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to
make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most captious boy could
desire.+Geoff and Jim+: A Story of School Life.Illustrated
     by A. G. WALKER."This is a prettily told story of the life spent by two motherless
     bairns at a small preparatory school.Both Geoff and Jim are very
     lovable characters, only Jim is the more so; and the scrapes he
     gets into and the trials he endures will no doubt, interest a large

board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they are cast ashore upon a

concluding chapters, he mentions "my worthy and ingenious friend, Sir
James Thornhill."This pleasing volume, after stating the excellency of
fruits, observes, "if fruit trees had no other advantage attending them
than to _look_ upon them, how pleasurable would _that_ be?Since there
is no flowering shrub excels, if equals that of a _peach_, or _apple
tree_ in bloom.The tender enamelled blossoms, verdant foliage, with

JOHN TAVERNER published, in 1660, a little Treatise, called The Making
of Fish Ponds, Breeding Fish, and _Planting Fruits_.Printed several
times, says Wood, in his Athenae.The Encyclopaedia of Gardening pronounces him "a popular
writer of very considerable talent, and indefatigable industry;" and
speaks highly of the interesting knowledge diffused through his very
numerous works, and gives a distinct list of them; so does Mr.Nicholls,
in his Life of Bowyer; and Mr.Weston, in his Tracts, and Dr.Bradley's "New Improvements of Planting and
Gardening," he has added the whole of that scarce Tract of Dr.Beale's,
the _Herefordshire Orchards_.One could wish to obtain his portrait,
were it only from his pen so well painting the alluring charms of
flowers:--"_Primroses_ and _Cowslips_, may be planted near the edges of
borders, and near houses, for the sake of their pretty smell.I
recommend the planting some of the common sorts that grow wild in the
woods, in some of the most rural places about the house; for I think
nothing can be more delightful, than to see great numbers of these
flowers, accompanied with _Violets_, growing under the hedges, avenues
of trees, and wilderness works._Violets_, besides their beauty, perfume
the air with a most delightful odour.Bradley, it appears, from
the Fruit Garden Kalendar, of the Rev.Lawrence, resided at Camden
House, Kensington.They each of them in their letters, in 1717,
subscribe themselves, "Your most affectionate friend."Lawrence
frequently styles him "the most ingenious Mr.Pulteney
says he "was the author of more than twenty separate publications,
chiefly on Gardening and Agriculture; published between the years 1716
and 1730.His 'New Improvement of Planting and Gardening, both
Philosophical and Practical,' 8vo.1717, went through repeated
impressions; as did his 'Gentleman's and Gardener's Kalendar,' (which
was the fourth part of the preceding book) both at home, and in
translations abroad.His 'Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature,'
4to.1721, was a popular, instructive, and entertaining work, and
continued in repute several years.The same may be said of his 'General
Treatise of Husbandry and Gardening,' 8vo.1726; and of his
'Practical Discourses concerning the Four Elements, as they relate to
the Growth of Plants,' 8vo.His '_Dictionarium Botanicum_,' 8vo.1728, was, I believe, the first attempt of the kind in England."On the
whole (says Dr.Pulteney) Bradley's writings, coinciding with the
growing taste for gardening, the introduction of exotics, and
improvements in husbandry, contributed to excite a more philosophical
view of these arts, and diffuse a general and popular knowledge of them
throughout the kingdom.Bradley has given at the end of his
curious "Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature," which is
embellished with neat engravings, a chapter "Of the most curious Gardens
in Europe, especially in Britain."In this chapter he justly observes,
that "a gentle exercise in a fresh air, where the mind is engaged with
variety of natural objects, contributes to content; and it is no new
observation, that the trouble of the mind wears and destroys the
constitution even of the most healthful body.All kinds of gardens
contribute to health."This volume also preserves the account of Lord
Ducie's noted old chesnut tree at Tortworth, supposed to be more than a
thousand years old; and of an elm belonging to his lordship, of a truly
gigantic growth.[49] Switzer thus speaks of Bradley:--"Mr.Bradley has
not only shewn himself a skilful botanist, but a man of experience in
other respects, and is every where a modest writer."Some writers have dwelt much upon his dissipation; let us
remember, however, that

   _Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
   We write in water._

Mr.Weston, in a communication inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for
November, 1806, says, "Although this country had a great loss by the
death of Evelyn, yet he was succeeded, in twenty years after, by another
of equal abilities, and indefatigable in endeavouring to improve the art
of gardening, as Bradley's numerous works will testify."TIMOTHY NOURSE, whose "Campania Foelix," 8vo.1700, has prefixed to
it, a very neat engraving by Vander Gucht, of rural life.He has
chapters on Fruit Trees; on the several kinds of Apple Trees, and on
Cyder and Perry.In page 262 he, with great humanity, strongly pleads to
acquit Lord Chancellor Bacon from the charge against him of corruption
in his high office.His Essay "Of a Country House," in this work, is
curious; particularly to those who wish to see the style of building,
and the decorations of a country seat at that period.Nourse also
published "A Discourse upon the Nature and Faculties of Man, with some
Considerations upon the Occurrences of Humane Life."Printed for Jacob
Tonson, at the Judge's Head, in Chancery-lane, 1686, 8vo.His chapter on
Solitude, wherein he descants on the delights of rural scenery and
gardens; and his conclusion, directing every man towards the attainment
of his own felicity, are worth perusing.That on Death is forcibly
written; he calls it "no more than for a man to close up all the
travails, pains, and misfortunes of life, with one sweet and eternal
sleep; he is now at everlasting rest; the fears and misery of poverty,
the anxieties of riches, the vexations of a process, do not devour him.He does not fear the calumnies of the base, nor the frowns of the great.'Tis death which delivers the prisoner from his fetters, and the slave
and captive from his chain; 'tis death which rescues the servant from
the endless toils of a laborious life, the poor from oppression, and
makes the beggar equal with princes.Here desperation finds a remedy,
all the languors of disease, all the frustrations and tediousness of
life, all the infirmities of age, all the disquiets of the passions, and
all the calamities of fortune, with whatever can make a man miserable,
vanish in these shades."In his very curious "Essay of a Country House,"
he thus moralizes:--"The variety of flowers, beautiful and fragrant,
with which his gardens are adorned, opening themselves, and dying one
after another, must admonish him of the fading state of earthly
pleasures, of the frailty of life, and of the succeeding generations to
which he must give place.The constant current of a fountain, or a
rivulet, must remind of the flux of time, which never returns."SAMUEL COLLINS, ESQ.of Archeton, Northamptonshire, author of "Paradise
Retrieved; 1717, 8vo.In the Preface to the Lady's Recreation, by
Charles Evelyn, Esq.he is extremely severe on this "Squire Collins,"
whom he accuses of ignorance and arrogance.JOHN EVELYN, son of the author of _Sylva_.His genius early displayed
itself; for when little more than fifteen, he wrote a Greek poem, which
must have some merit, because his father has prefixed it to the second
edition of his _Sylva_.Nicoll's Collection of Poems, are some by
him.There are two poems of his in Dryden's Miscellany.He translated
Plutarch's Life of Alexander from the Greek; and the History of Two
Grand Viziers, from the French.When only nineteen, he translated from
the Latin, Rapin on Gardens.The Quarterly Review, in
its review of Mr.Bray's Memoirs of Evelyn, thus speaks of this son, and
of his father:--"It was his painful lot to follow to the grave his only
remaining son, in the forty-fourth year of his age, a man of much
ability and reputation, worthy to have supported the honour of his name.Notwithstanding these repeated sorrows, and the weight of nearly
fourscore years, Evelyn still enjoyed uninterrupted health, and
unimpaired faculties; he enjoyed also the friendship of the wise and the
good, and the general esteem beyond any other individual of his
age."[50]


THOMAS FAIRCHILD, whose garden and vineyard at Hoxton, Mr.Bradley
mentions in high terms, in numberless pages of his many works.I will
merely quote from one of his works, viz.from his Philosophical Account
of the Works of Nature:--"that curious garden of Mr.Thomas Fairchild,
at Hoxton, where I find the greatest collection of fruits that I have
yet seen, and so regularly disposed, both for order in time of ripening
and good pruning of the several kinds, that I do not know any person in
Europe to excel him in that particular; and in other things he is no
less happy in his choice of such curiosities, as a good judgement and
universal correspondence can procure."Fairchild published The City
Gardener; 8vo.He left
funds for a Botanical Sermon to be delivered annually at St.Leonard,
Shoreditch, on each Whitsun Tuesday, "On the wonderful works of God in
the creation, or on the certainty of the resurrection of the dead,
proved by the certain changes of the animal and vegetable parts of the
creation.Fairchild:--"My plan does
not allow me to deviate so far as to cite authors on the subject of
gardening, unless eminent for their acquaintance with English botany.Some have distinguished themselves in this way; and I cannot omit to
mention, with applause, the names of Fairchild, Knowlton, Gordon, and
Miller.The first of these made himself known to the Royal Society, by
some 'New Experiments relating to the different, and sometimes contrary
motion of the Sap;' which were printed in the Phil.He also assisted in making experiments, by which the sexes of plants
were illustrated, and the doctrine confirmed.Fairchild died in
November, 1729."GEORGE RICKETS, of Hoxton, was much noted about 1688 and 1689.Rea, in
his Flora, says of him, "Mr.Rickets, of Hogsden, often remembered, the
best and most faithful florist now about London."Rea describes, in his
Flora, one hundred and ninety different kinds of tulips, and says, "All
these tulips, and _many others_, may be had of Mr.Worlidge
thus speaks of him:--"he hath the greatest variety of the choicest
apples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, peaches, malacolones,
noctorines, figgs, vines, currans, gooseberries, rasberries, mulberries,
medlars, walnuts, nuts, filberts, chesnuts, &c. that any man hath, and
can give the best account of their natures and excellencies."And again
he says, "the whole nation is obliged to the industry of the ingenious
Mr.George Rickets, gardner at Hoxton or Hogsden without Bishopsgate,
near London, at the sign of the Hand there; who can furnish any planter
with all or most of the fruit trees before mentioned, having been for
many years a most laborious and industrious collector of the best
species of all sorts of fruit from foreign parts.And hath also the
richest and most complete collection of all the great variety of
flower-bearing trees and shrubs in the kingdom.That there is not a day
in the year, but the trees, as well as the most humble plants, do there
yield ornaments for Flora; with all sorts of curious and pleasant
winter-greens, that seemed to perpetuate the spring and summer, from the
most humble myrtle, to the very true cedar of Libanus.Not without
infinite variety of tulips, auriculaes, anemones, gillyflowers, and
all other sorts of pleasant, and delicate flowers, that he may be truly
said to be the master-flowrist of England; and is ready to furnish any
ingenious person with any of his choicest plants."JOHN COWEL appears to have been a noted gardener at Hoxton, about 1729.He was the author of the "Curious and Profitable Gardener."of Pynes, in Devonshire, who published, in 1729, "A
Treatise on Cyder Making, with a Catalogue of Cyder Apples of Character;
to which is prefixed, a Dissertation on Cyder, and Cyder-Fruit."BENJAMIN WHITMILL, Sen.Gardeners at Hoxton, published the
sixth edition, in small 8vo.of their "Kalendarium Universale: or, the
Gardener's Universal Calendar."The following is part of their
Preface:--"The greatest persons, in all ages, have been desirous of a
country retirement, where every thing appears in its native simplicity.The inhabitants are religious, the fair sex modest, and every
countenance bears a picture of the heart.What, therefore, can be a more
elegant amusement, to a good and great man, than to inspect the
beautiful product of fields and gardens, when every month hath its
pleasing variety of plants and flowers.And if innocence be our greatest
happiness, where can we find it but in a country life?In fields and
gardens we have pleasures unenvied, and beauties unsought for; and any
discovery for the improvement of them, is highly praiseworthy.In the
growth of a plant, or a tree, we view the progress of nature, and ever
observe that all her works yield beauty and entertainment.To cultivate
this beauty, is a task becoming the wealthy, the polite, and the
learned; this is so generally understood, that there are few gentlemen
of late, who are not themselves their chief gardeners.And it certainly
redounds more to the honour and satisfaction of a gardener, that he is a
preserver and pruner of all sorts of fruit trees, than it does to the
happiness of the greatest general that he has been successful in killing
mankind."SAMUEL TROWEL, of Poplar, published, in 1739, A New Treatise of
Husbandry and Gardening; 12mo.This was translated in Germain,
at Leipsig, 1750, in 8vo.FRANCIS COVENTRY, who wrote an admirable paper in the _World_, (No.15,) on the absurd novelties introduced in gardens.He wrote Penshurst,
in Dodsley's Poems.published the "Scot's Gardener's Director," 8vo.A
new edition, entitled "The _British_ Gardener's Director, chiefly
adapted to the Climate of the Northern Counties," was published at
_Edinburgh_, 1764, 8vo.The Encyclopaedia of Gardening calls his book
"an original and truly valuable work;" and in page 87, 846, and 1104,
gives some interesting particulars of this gentleman's passion for
gardening.author of "The Fruit Gardener," to which he has
prefixed an interesting Preface on the Fruit Gardens of the Ancients.In
this Preface he also relates the origin of fruit gardens, by the
hermits, and monastic orders.In his Introduction, he says, that "every
kind of fruit tree seems to contend in spring, who shall best entertain
the possessor with the beauty of their blossoms.Mankind are always
happy with the prospect of plenty; in no other scene is it exhibited
with such charming variety, as in the fruit garden and orchard.Are
gentlemen fond of indulging their tastes?Nature, from the plentiful
productions of the above, regales them with a variety of the finest
flavours and exalted relishes.To cool us in the heat of summer, she
copiously unites the acid to an agreeable sweetness.Flowering shrubs
and trees are often purchased by gentlemen at a high price; yet not one
of them can compare in beauty with an _apple tree_, when beginning to
expand its blossoms."[52] Speaking of the greengage, he says, "its taste
is so exquisitely sweet and delicious, that nothing can exceed it."He
enlivens many of his sections on the cultivation of various fruits, by
frequent allusions to Theophrastus, Virgil, Pliny, and other _Rei
rustica scriptores_.His chapter on Pears, (the various kinds of which
possess "a profusion of sweets, heightened by an endless variety of
delicious flavours,") is particularly profuse.JAMES RUTTER published, in 1767, Modern Eden, or the Gardener's
Universal Guide; 8vo.JOHN DICKS published, in 1769, The New Gardener's Dictionary; in sixty
numbers, small folio, 30s.JAMES GARTON published, in 1769, The Practical Gardener; 8vo.---- WILDMAN published, in 1768, a Treatise on the Culture of Pear

published a Treatise on the Ananas, or Pine Apple: containing Plain and

Directions for Raising Melons.JAMES MEADER, Gardener at Sion House, and afterwards to the Empress

his "Tracts on Practical Agriculture, and Gardening," 1762, 8vo.a
Catalogue of English Authors on Agriculture, Gardening, &c. There is
another edition in 1773, with additions.His intelligent Catalogue is
brought down to the end of the year 1772.This volume of Tracts contains
an infinity of ingenious and curious articles.One of the chapters
contains "A Plan for Planting all the Turnpike Roads in England with
Timber Trees."[53] He most zealously wishes to encourage planting."I
believe (says this candid writer) that one of the principal reasons why
few persons plant, springs from a fearful conjecture that their days
will have been passed, before the forest can have risen.But let not the
parent harbour so selfish an idea; it should be his delight, to look
forward to the advantage which his children would receive from the
timber which he planted, contented if it flourished every year beneath
his inspection; surely there is much more pleasure in planting of trees,
than in cutting of them down.View but the place where a fine tree
stands, what an emblem does it afford of present beauty and of future
use; examine the spot after the noble ornament shall have been felled,
and see how desolate it will appear.Perhaps there is not a better
method of inducing youth to have an early inclination for planting,
than for fathers, who have a landed estate, to persuade those children
who are to inherit it, as soon as they come to years of discretion, to
make a small nursery, and to let them have the management of it
themselves; they will then see the trees yearly thriving under their
hands: as an encouragement to them, they should, when the trees are at a
fit growth to plant out, let them have the value of them for their
pocket money.This will, in their tender years, fix so strong an idea of
the value, and the great consequence of planting, as will never be
eradicated afterwards; and many youths, of the age of twenty-five,
having planted quick growing trees, may see the industry of their
juvenile years amply rewarded at that early age, a time when most young
men begin to know the value of money.Pope, in one of his
letters to Mr.Allen, thus discovers his own generous mind:--"I am now
as busy in planting for myself as I was lately in planting for another.I am pleased to think my trees will afford shade and fruit to others,
when I shall want them no more."Addison's admirable recommendation
of planting, forms No.He therein says, "When a
man considers that the putting a few twigs in the ground, is doing good
to one who will make his appearance in the world about fifty years
hence, or that he is perhaps making one of his own descendants easy or
rich, by so inconsiderable an expence; if he finds himself averse to it,
he must conclude that he has a poor and base heart.Most people are of
the humour of an old fellow of a college, who, when he was pressed by
the society to come into something that might redound to the good of
their successors, grew very peevish._We are always doing_, says he,
_something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do something
for us._"[55] Mr.Weston also published The Universal Botanist and
Nursery; 1770, 1774, 4 vols.The Gardener and Planter's Calendar,
containing the Method of Raising Timber Trees, Fruit Trees, and Quicks
for Hedges; with Directions for Forming and Managing a Garden every
Month in the Year; also many New Improvements in the Art of Gardening;
8vo.Weston then appears to have lived at Kensington Gore.The
Gentleman's Magazine for November, 1806, says, that he died at
Leicester, in 1806, aged seventy-four.He was formerly a thread hosier
there.It gives an amusing and full list of his various publications,
particularly of his intended "Natural History of Strawberries."The best edition of his "Essay on Design in Gardening,"
appears to have been that of 1795, in 8vo.Two Appendixes were published
in 1798, which are said to have been written by Mr.Nichols's fourth volume of Illustrations of the Literary History of the
Eighteenth Century, are some particulars of Mr.He published
Hoccleve's Poems, with a Glossary; an Answer to Thomas Paine; the Life
of Lord Howe; a Supplement to Johnson's Dictionary: in the ill-tempered
preface to which, he thus strangely speaks of that Dictionary:--"this
muddiness of intellect sadly besmears and defaces almost every page of
the composition."This is only a small instance of his virulence against
Johnson in this preface.Mason's
sarcasms would have been softened, or even subdued, by its glowing and
eloquent preface, which informs us that this great work was composed
"without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile
of favour."Mason, even in the above Essay,
discovers, in three instances, his animosity to our "Dictionary writer,"
for so he calls Dr.Boswell, speaking of Johnson's preface,
says, "We cannot contemplate without wonder, the vigorous and splendid
thoughts which so highly distinguish that performance;" and on the
Dictionary he observes, that "the world contemplated with wonder, so
stupendous a work, achieved by one man, while other countries had
thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies."Linnaeus and
Haller styled Ray's History of Plants, _opus immensi laboris_.One may
justly apply the same words to this Dictionary.Mason that he escaped (what Miss Seward called) "the dead-doing
broadside of Dr.George Mason omits no opportunity of
censuring Mr.Whateley's Observations on Modern Gardening.In the above
Essay, he censures him in seven different pages, and in his distinct
chapter or division on this book of Mr.Whateley's, (consisting of
thirteen pages) there are no less than thirty-three additional sneers,
or faults, found with his opinions.He does not acknowledge in him one
single solitary merit, except at page 191.In page 160, he nearly, if
not quite, calls him a _fool_, and declares that _vanity_ is the passion
to which he is constantly sacrificing.[56] It would be an insult to any
one who has read Mr.Whateley's work, to endeavour to clear him from
such a virulent and ill-founded attack.Johnson, with all
his deep learning, nor Mr.Whateley, with all the cultivated fancy of a
rich scholastic mind, would either of them have been able to comprehend,
or to understand, or even to make head or tail of the first half of Mr.George Mason's poem, with which he closes the above edition of his
Essay.As he has been so caustically severe against Dr.Johnson, it
cannot be ungenerous if one applies to the above part of his own poem,
the language of a French critic on another subject:--"Le style en est
dur, et scabreux.Il semble que l'auteur a ramasse les termes les plus
extraordinaires pour se rendre inintelligible."Percy, Bishop of
Dromore, in vol.x. page 602, of the British Critic, has given a
critique of Mr.Mason's edition of Hoccleve, in which he chastises its
injustice, arrogance, and ignorance.Mason has been more liberal in
warmly praising Kent, and Shenstone, in acknowledging the great taste
and elegance of Mr.Thomas Warton, when the latter notices Milton's line
of

   _Bosom'd high in tufted trees,_

which picturesque remark of Mr.Warton's could not have been excelled
even by the nice and critical pen of the late Sir U. Price; and when he
informs us, in more than one instance, of the great Earl of Chatham's
"turning his mind to the embellishment of rural nature."THOMAS WHATELEY, on whose "Observations on Modern Gardening," the
Encyclopaedia of Gardening (that most comprehensive assemblage of every
thing delightful and curious in this art,) observes, "It is remarkable,
that so little is known of a writer, the beauty of whose style, and the
justness of whose taste, are universally acknowledged."The same work
further says, "his excellent book, so frequently referred to by all
succeeding writers on garden scenery, ought to be in the hands of every
man of taste."And the same work still further observes, that "its style
has been pronounced by Ensor, inimitable, and the descriptions with
which his investigations are accompanied, have been largely copied, and
amply praised by Alison, in his work On Taste.The book was soon
translated into the continental languages, and is judiciously praised in
the _Mercure de France_, _Journal Encyclopedique_, and Weiland's
_Journal_.G. Mason alone dissents from the general opinion, enlarging
on the very few faults or peculiarities which are to be found in the
book.Wheatley, or Whately (for so little is known of this eminent man,
that we have never been able to ascertain satisfactorily the orthography
of his name,) was proprietor of Nonsuch Park, in Surrey; and was
secretary to the Earl of Suffolk.He published only this work, soon
after which he died.After his death, some remarks on Shakspeare, from
his pen, were published in a small 12mo."A second edition of this
elegant little work was published in 1808, by Parson, Oxford; or
Rivington, St.Paul's; in which, the advertisement to the reader informs
us, that "the respectable author intended to have gone through eight or
ten of the principal characters of Shakspeare, but suspended his design,
in order to finish his Observations on Modern Gardening, first published
in the year 1770; immediately after which time, _he was engaged in such
an active scene of public life_, as left him but little leisure to
attend to the Belles Lettres; and in the year 1772 he died."[57]

His remarks on some of the characters of Shakspeare (whom, in his
_Observations_, he calls _the great master of nature_) breathe in many
of his pages, that fire, which he could have caught only from those of
the great poet.Such was his eagerness to complete his _Observations_,
that he for a short while "suspended his design" of examining other
characters of the poet, when the bright effusions of his genius "fled up
to the stars from whence they came."This elegant little work is merely
a fragment, nay, even an unfinished fragment.It must, then, cause deep
regret, that death should so prematurely have deprived us of that rich
treasure of animated thoughts, which, no doubt, would have sprung from
his further tracing the poet's deep and piercing knowledge of the human
heart.Whateley, what he himself applies to
the poet:--"He had a genius to express all that his penetration could
discover."Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.The Journal Encyclopedique, Juilliet, 1771, when speaking of
the French translation of Whateley's Observations, says, "On ne peut
gueres se faire une idee de ces jardins, si l'on n'a ete a Londres.Accoutumes a la symetrie des notres, nous n'imaginons pas qu'on puisse
etablir une forme irreguliere, comme une regle principale: cependant
ceux qui sentent combien la noble simplicite de la nature est superieure
a tous les rafinemens symetriques de l'art, donneront peuetetre la
preference aux jardins Anglois.C'est l'effet que doit produire la
lecture de cet ouvrage, qui quoique destine aux amateurs et aux
compositeurs des jardins, offre aux gens de gout, aux artistes et
sur-tout aux peintres, des observations fines et singulieres sur
plusieurs effets de perspective et sur les arts en general; aux
philosophes, des reflections justes sur les affections de notre ame; aux
poetes, des descriptions exactes, quoique vives, des plus beaux jardins
d'Angleterre dans tous les genres, qui decelent dans l'Auteur un oeil
infiment exerce, une grande connoissance des beaux arts, une belle
imagination et un esprit accoutume a penser."The "bloom of an orchard, the festivity of a hay field, and the carols
of harvest home," could not have met with a more cheerful and benevolent
pen than Mr.Whateley's; a love of country pervades many of his pages;
nor could any one have traced the placid scenery, or rich magnificence
of nature, with a happier pen than when he records the walk to the
cottage at Claremont, the grandeur and majesty of the scene at
_Blenheim_, or _Stowe_, _Persfield_, _Wotton_ in the vale of
Aylesbury--the rugged, savage, and craggy points of _Middleton Dale_, "a
chasm rent in the mountain by some convulsion of nature, beyond the
memory of man, or perhaps before the island was peopled," with its many
rills, springs, rivulets, and water-falls--the vast cliffs of rocks at
_Matlock_, _Bath_, that "scene of romantic magnificence; from such
scenes, probably, was conceived the wild imagination, in ancient
mythology, of the giants piling _Pelion_ upon _Ossa_; the loftiness of
the rocks, and the character of the _Derwent_, a torrent in which force
and fury prevail; the cascades in it are innumerable; before the water
is recovered from one fall, it is hurried down another; and its
agitation being thus increased by repeated shocks, it pushes on with
restless violence to the next, where it dashes against fragments of
rocks, or foams among heaps of stones which the stream has driven
together"--the dusky gloom at the iron forge, "close to the cascade of
the Weir, (between _Ross_ and _Monmouth_) where the agitation of the
current is increased by large fragments of rocks, which have been swept
down by floods from the banks, or shivered by tempests from the brow;
and the sullen sound, at stated intervals, from the strokes of the great
hammers in the forge, deadens the roar of the water-fall"--the solitude,
the loveliness, and the stillness of _Dovedale_, "the whole of which has
the air of enchantment; grotesque as chance can cast, wild as nature can
produce"--the monkish tomb-stones, and the monuments of benefactors long
since forgotten, which appear above the green sward, at _Tintern Abbey_,
with its maimed effigies, and sculpture worn with age and weather--his
view to the approach to Lord _Cadogan's_, near _Reading_--his feeling
and enchanting description of the _Leasowes_--"the wonderful efforts
which art has made at _Painshill_ to rival nature;" where the massy
richness of its hanging wood "gives an air of grandeur to the
whole"--the _Tinian_, and other lawns, and noble and magnificent views
in that vast sylvan scene _Hagley_, where, in a spot which once
delighted Mr.Pope, is inscribed an urn to his memory, "which, when
shewn by a gleam of moonlight through the trees, fixes that
thoughtfulness and composure to which the mind is insensibly led by the
rest of this elegant scene."His section "Of the Seasons," where he descants on the _spirit_ of the
morning, the _excess_ of noon, or the _temperance_ of evening," must
strike every one by its felicity of style; and the reader may judge of
the rich pages which this book contains, even from what he says of
water:--"It accommodates itself to every situation; is the most
interesting object in a landscape, and the happiest circumstance in a
retired recess; captivates the eye at a distance, invites approach, and
is delightful when near; it refreshes an open exposure; it animates a
shade; cheers the dreariness of a waste, and enriches the most crowded
view; in form, in style, and in extent, may be made equal to the
greatest compositions, or adapted to the least; it may spread in a calm
expanse to soothe the tranquillity of a peaceful scene; or hurrying
along a devious course, add splendour to a gay, and extravagance to a
romantic, situation.So various are the characters which water can
assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an
impression which it cannot enforce; a deep stagnated pool, dank and dark
with shades which it dimly reflects, befits the seat of melancholy; even
a river, if it be sunk between two dismal banks, and dull both in motion
and colour, is like a hollow eye which deadens the countenance; and over
a sluggard, silent stream, creeping heavily along all together, hangs a
gloom, which no art can dissipate, nor even the sunshine disperse.A
gently murmuring rill, clear and shallow, just gurgling, just dimpling,
imposing silence, suits with solitude, and leads to meditation; a
brisker current, which wantons in little eddies over a bright sandy
bottom, or babbles among pebbles, spreads cheerfulness all around; a
greater rapidity, and more agitation, to a certain degree are animating;
but in excess, instead of wakening, they alarm the senses; the roar and
the rage of a torrent, its force, its violence, its impetuosity, tend to
inspire terror; that terror, which, whether as cause or effect, is so
nearly allied to sublimity."[58]


DANIEL MALTHUS, ESQ.purchased, in 1759, the Rookery, near Dorking,
noted for its beauties of hill, dale, wood, and water; he sold it in
1768.He translated Gerardin, _De la Composition des Paysages_, 12mo.1783, to which he prefixed a preface, being, chiefly, remarks on what
the gardens of the Greeks and Romans were; a view of Rosseau's tomb is
prefixed.Malthus justly observes, that this Essay "is full of the
most insinuating eloquence, that it is wrote by the friend of Rousseau,
and from scenes which realize some of its most beautiful descriptions."He further observes, that "trifling as this enquiry will appear in
itself, it may add something towards the benevolent purpose of M.
d'Ernonville, which is to make men sensible of the exhaustless charms of
nature, to lead them back to their simple and original tastes, to
promote the variety and resources of a country life, and to unite its
usefulness with its embellishment."[59]

very properly transcribed the whole of that masterly production of Mr.Walpole's pen, his _History of the Modern Taste in Gardening_.He
observes, that "a pen guided by so masterly a hand, must ever be
productive of information and entertainment, when employed upon a
subject so truly interesting.Desirous of conveying to our readers all
the information which we can compress, with propriety, within the limits
of our plan, we wished to have given the _substance_ of this valuable
paper; but finding it already in the language of simplicity, and being
aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_ with the
productions of genius, we had only one alternative: either wholly to
transcribe, or wholly to reject."Marshall, alluding to the above
work of his, says, "Wheatley, Mason, and Nature, with some Experience,
and much Observation, are the principal sources from which this part of
our work was drawn; it was planned, and in part written, among the
magnificent scenes of nature, in Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and
Gloucestershire, where the rich and the romantic are happily blended, in
a manner unparalleled in any other part of the island."In this same
work is preserved, Mr.Gray's letter on the scenery of _Grasmere Water_.His descriptions of many trees and shrubs are extremely interesting; and
he has rendered them more so by his frequent quotations from Mr.The Rural Economy of the Southern
Counties; 2 vols.--of the Midland Counties, 2 vols.--of Gloucestershire,
2 vols.--of Norfolk, 2 vols.--of Yorkshire, 2 vols.--Agriculture of the
Southern Counties, 2 vols.--Minutes of Agriculture--and a Review of the
Landscape, a didactic poem--and of an Essay on the Picturesque.of Gardening, after relating varied information respecting
him, says, that he "finally retired to a considerable property he
possessed in his native county, in the Vale of Cleveland, in 1808, where
he died, at an advanced age, in 1819.He was a man of little education,
but of a strong and steady mind: and pursued, in the most consistent
manner, from the year 1780 to his death, the plan he originally laid
down; that of collecting and condensing the agricultural practices of
the different counties of England, with a view to a general work on
Landed Property, which he published; another on Agriculture, which he
did not live to complete, and a _Rural Institute_, in which he was
supplanted by the Board of Agriculture."His observations on the
_Larch_, in vol.i. of his "Planting and Rural Ornament," and the zeal
with which he recommends the planting of it on the infertile heathy
flats of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, on the bleak and barren heights
of Yorkshire, Westmoreland, Cornwall, and Devon, and on the Welch and
Salopean hills; and the powerful language with which he enforces its
valuable qualities, merit the attention of every man of property.WILLIAM SPEECHLY.He wrote Hints on Domestic Rural Economy; 8vo.On the
Culture of the Vine and Pine Apple, with Hints on the Formation of
Vineyards in England.On the Culture of the Pine Apple, and the
Management of the Hot-House; 8vo.He made a tour in Holland, chiefly to
observe the Dutch mode of cultivating the Pine, and the Grape.calls him "the Moses of modern British vine
dressers;" and in the Gardener's Magazine for January, 1828, has given
an interesting and honourable character of him.He died at Great Milton,
in 1819, aged eighty-six.[60] Marshall, in his Planting and Rural
Ornament, has given us Mr.Speechley's sensible letter on the Duke of
Portland's Plantations.Johnson says "he perhaps surpassed every
practical gardener of his age."PHILIP LE BROCQ, chaplain to the Duke of Gloucester, wrote,

1, A Description of Certain Methods of Planting, Training, and Managing
all Kinds of Fruit Trees, Vines, &c. London, 8vo.2, Sketch of a Plan for making the New Forest, a Real Forest.WALTER NICHOL, whom Mr.Loudon, in his Encyclopaedia, calls an author of
merit, and informs us that Mr.Nichol, "in the year 1810, undertook an
extensive journey through England, for the purpose of visiting the
principal seats and plantations, with a view, on his return, to compose
the _Planter's Calendar_.This work had scarcely commenced, when he was
seized with an illness which carried him off suddenly, in March, 1811."His works appear to be the following:--

The Gardener's Kalendar; or, Monthly Directory of every Branch of
Horticulture; 8vo.The Planter's Kalendar; or, the Nurseryman's and Forester's Guide; 8vo.The Villa Garden Directory; or, Monthly Index of Work to be done in
Gardens, Shrubberies, &c.; 12mo.Scotch Forcing Gardener; 8vo.Johnson says "his works are of the first authority, and rank as the
equals of those of Abercrombie, being the result of long practice during
an enlightened era of our art."JAMES MADDOCK, of the Society of Friends, and commercial florist, at
Walworth, where, about the middle of last century, he established the
florist garden there, now belonging to Milliken and Curtis.He published the Florist's Directory, and Complete Treatise
on the Culture of Flowers; 8vo.THOMAS S. D. BUCKNALL, Esq.published the Orchardist; extracted from the
Society's Trans.for the Encouragement of Arts, &c.; _with additions_.I had omitted the following, for which I am indebted to Mr.Johnson's
History of English Gardening:--

RICHARD RICHARDSON.Of either of the above enumerated Authors on Gardening, I have not been
able to discover any Portrait.[Illustration]

   Of the following we _have_ Portraits:--

LEONARD MASCALL'S portrait appears at the bottom of the curious title
page to his "Government of Cattle," 4to.He published,
in 1572, "The New Art of Planting and Grafting;" 4to.WILLIAM BULLEYN practised physic at Durham.He had
the misfortune to lose great part of his library by shipwreck.He was
thrown into prison for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical
treatises.Bishop Tanner says he was a man of acute judgment, and true
piety.He was universally esteemed as a polished scholar, and as a man
of probity, benevolence, and piety.Pulteney:--"Of Dr.Bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard, before
his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him, in wood, prefixed
to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of most of his
works.Stukely, who, in 1722, was at
the expence of having a small head of him engraved.He proves that we
had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries and hops, of our own
growth, (before the importation of these articles into England), by
London and Kentish gardeners.His zeal for the promotion of the useful
arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial
interests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise; and for the
information he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe
him acknowledgments."In a note to his Life, in the Biog.folio, 1748, is a curious account of many fruits, &c. then in our
gardens.Richardson's portraits to Granger
gives us the above profile.Johnson, at page 51 of his History of
English Gardening, pointedly says, "Dr.Bulleyn deserves the veneration
of every lover of gardening, for his strenuous advocating its cause, at
a time when it had become a fashion to depreciate the products of our
English gardens."And at page 57, pays him a further just tribute.THOMAS HYLL, who, in 1574, published, in 4to., "The Profitable Arte of
Gardeninge."His interesting chapter on
Bees is annexed to these editions."[61] There appears another edition in
small 12mo.imprinted at London, in Flete-strete, neare to St.Dunstone's Church, by Thomas Marshe, 1658.There are other editions, as
1570 and 1574, 4to.; and 1563 and 1594, 16mo.Bromley thus
mentions a portrait of him:--"Thomas Hill, wooden cut, prefixed to his
Physiognomie; 12mo.A friend to Hyll, in a complimentary
letter, prefixed to the above book, thus, in part, addresses the
reader:--

   _With painfull pen the writer hath exprest in English plane,
   The needfull ayd, and mightie force, that doth in hearbes remaine,
   The time to set, the time to plant, the time to raise again,
   This man by treble diligence hath brought to light with paine._

The portraits of the Lord Chancellor BACON are well known; but in Mr.Montagu's late edition of his works, a new or juvenile portrait is
added, namely, a most expressive, intelligent, and beautiful miniature
of him at his age of eighteen, by Hilyard, of whom Dr.Donne said,

         ----_a hand or eye
   By Hilyard drawn, is worth a history
   By a worse painter._

This fine edition of his works is illustrated by five portraits, taken
at different periods of his lordship's life; by engravings of his
residence, and monument, fac-similes, and other embellishments.In
Mallett's edition are two portraits, one by Vertue, finely
engraved.[62]

GERARDE'S portrait (a fine one) is prefixed to his own edition of his
Herbal.No painter, or engraver's
name, except the initials, W. R. intertwined, which I suppose are those
of W. Rogers, the engraver.There is another good head of Gerarde, a
small oval one, in the title page to Johnson's edition.A portrait, in
oil, of Gerarde, was sold by Mr.Pulteney
reviews both these Herbals.Gerarde is highly extolled by Dr.Bulleyn,
and indeed attained deserved eminence in his day.Pulteney relates
that "the thousand novelties which were brought into England by our
circumnavigators, Raleigh and Cavendish, in 1580 and 1588, excited a
degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of
considerable recollection, be easily conceived.Raleigh himself appears
to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of
nature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period.And
posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to
this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of
introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the
service of man.A voyage round the globe, howsoever familiarized in
ours, was, in that age, a most interesting and fruitful occasion of
enquiry.The return of Raleigh, and the fame of his manifold discoveries
and collections, brought over from the continent the celebrated Clusius,
then in the fifty-fifth year of his age.He, who added more to the stock
of botany, in his day, than all his contemporaries united, visited
England for the third time, to partake, at this critical juncture, in
the general gratification.At this eventful period, Gerarde was in the
vigour of life, and, without doubt, felt the influence, and reaped
the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated."One
of the editions of Gerarde thus appears in a bookseller's
catalogue:--"Gerarde's Herball; or Generall Historie of Plants, very
much enlarged by Johnson, folio, _beautiful impression of the
frontispiece by Payne, fine copy, old Russia, gilt back, L3.[63]


WALTER BLYTHE'S whole-length portrait (exhibiting a pensive and
penetrating aspect), is prefixed to his "English Improver Improved;" and
which work Professor Martyn terms "an original and incomparable work for
the time."Beale calls him "honest Captain Blithe."GERVASE MARKHAM'S portrait is prefixed to his "Perfect Horseman;" 8vo.It is re-engraved for Richardson's portraits to Granger.Markham
appears to have been a good soldier, as well as a good scholar.1623, "The Country House-Wife's Garden."He wrote
Herod and Antipater, a tragedy.Langbaine speaks very much in his
praise, and seemingly not without reason.Dibden, in his "Library
Companion," says, "on many accounts does Markham seem entitled to more
notice and commendation."He translated Leibault's Maison Rustique, in
1616, in 4to.or small folio, and augmented it with many additions from
Oliver de Serres, and others.Weston, in his Catalogue, says he
re-printed the editions in 1614 and 1631, of Barnaby Gooche's Husbandry.He published many books on husbandry, on fowling, on angling, on
military discipline, on horsemanship.Many of their titles are
enumerated in Langbaine, and in Weston, and they appear all to be more
fully stated in Watts's Bibl.Much information, as to Markham, may
be seen in vol.of the Censura Literaria; and in Sir E. Brydges's
edition of Phillips's Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum, appears, perhaps,
the best list of his works, with a brief memoir.[64]


PARKINSON'S excellent portrait, by Marshall, appears in the title page
to his _Theatrum Botanicum_, in 1640.Some one _may_ now possess the
original.In his _Paradisus_, 1635, there is a very scurvy engraving of
his healthy, and hearty-looking old countenance.In this miserable cut,
which is on wood, the graver, Christopher Switzer, does not seem to have
had a strife "_with nature to outdo the life_."Marshall's head is
re-engraved for Richardson's Illustrations to Granger.Parkinson rose to
such a degree of reputation, as to be appointed Apothecary to King
James.He was appointed herbalist to Charles I. Dr.Pulteney speaks
highly of both the above works, particularly of the _Theatrum_.All the
memorials we have of the private history of this most industrious and
zealous herbalist, are very scanty.He died about 1645, aged about 78.The curious contents of his _Paradisus_ are diffusively narrated in
Johnson's English Gardening.When perusing the pages of either of the
above, one may exclaim,

                           ----"not a tree,
   A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains
   A folio volume.We may read, and read,
   And read again; and still find something new,
   Something to please, and something to instruct,
   E'en in the humble weed."[Illustration]

The above is scarcely better than Switzer's.There appears no faithful
portrait of Parkinson, but Marshall's, who _had the felicity_ to draw
other portraits besides his.Hollar's striking portraits of the TRADESCANTS, are well known.On their
tomb, at Lambeth, the following lines form part of the inscription:--

   These famous Antiquarians, that had been
   Both Gardeners to the rose and lily Queen,
   Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when
   Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,
   And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,
   And change this Garden for a Paradise.In the Ashmolean Museum, is a portrait of the SON, _in his garden_, with
a spade in his hand.Nichols's "Illustrations to Granger,"
consisting of seventy-five portraits, appear those of the Tradescants,
father and son.Smith also engraved John Tradescant, with his son, and
their monument, 1793.Weston, in his Catalogue, fully describes the
_Museum Tradescantium_.Pulteney observes, that "in a work devoted
to the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to
demand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period,
by their garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently
useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden,
drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir W. Watson, and printed in
vol.His widow erected a
curious monument, in memory of the family, in Lambeth church-yard, of
which a large account, and engravings from a drawing of it in the
Pepysian Library, at Cambridge, are given by the late learned Dr.SIR HENRY WOTTON, Provost of Eaton.His portrait is given in Isaac
Walton's Lives of Wotton, and others.It, of course, accompanies
Zouch's, and the other well-known editions of Isaac Walton's Lives.Daniel went to the garden.In
Evans's Illustrations to Granger, is Sir H. Wotton, from the picture in
the Bodleian Library, engraved by _Stow_.In Sir Henry's Reflections on
Ancient and Modern Learning, is his chapter "On Ancient and Modern
Agriculture and Gardening."Cowley wrote an elegy on him, which thus
commences:--

   What shall we say since silent now is he,
   Who when he spoke, all things would silent be;
   Who had so many languages in store,
   That only Fame can speak of him with more.Isaac Walton published the "_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, or, Lives, Letters,
Poems, &c. by Sir Henry Wotton," 12mo.1654, with portraits of Wotton,
Charles I., Earl of Essex, and Buckingham.Sir E. Brydges printed at his
private press, at Lee Priory, Sir Henry's Characters of the Earl of
Essex and Buckingham.In the _Reliquiae_, among many curious and
interesting articles, is preserved Sir Henry's delicately complimentary
letter to Milton on receiving from him _Comus_.Sir Henry, when a
resident at Venice, (where he was sent on three several embassies by
James) purchased for that munificent encourager of painting, the Duke of
Buckingham, several valuable pictures, which were added to the Duke's
magnificent collection.Isaac Walton's Life of Wotton thus
concludes:--"Dying worthy of his name and family, worthy of the love of
so many princes, and persons of eminent wisdom and learning, worthy of
the trust committed unto him for the service of his prince and country."And, in his Angler, he thus sweetly paints the warm attachment he had
for Wotton:--"a man with whom I have often fished and conversed, whose
learning, wit, and cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of
the delights of mankind.Peace and patience, and a calm content, did
cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton."Dallaway, in his Anecdotes of the Arts, mentions
the following portrait of Sir Thomas:--"At Devonshire-house is a family
groupe, by Dobson, of Sir Thomas Browne.He is smiling with the utmost
complacency upon his children, who surround him."His portrait is also
prefixed to his works.Dict., folio, 1748, says, "his
picture, in the College of Physicians, shews him to have been remarkably
handsome, and to have possessed, in a singular degree, the blessings of
a grave, yet cheerful and inviting, countenance."The same work farther
gives him a most amiable character.Ray, in his Ornithology, does
not omit paying a just compliment to his assistant and friend, "the
deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne."Evelyn, in 1671, mentions Sir
Thomas Browne's garden at Norwich, as containing a paradise of
varieties, and the gardens of all the inhabitants as full of excellent
flowers.Switzer says, "The noble elegance of his style has since
induced many to read his works, (of which, that of _Cyrus's gardens_ is
some of the brightest,) though they have had little inclination to the
practice of gardening itself.There remains nothing that I have heard of
his putting gardening actually into practice himself; but some of his
last works being observations on several scarce plants mentioned in
Scripture; and of Garlands and Coronary garden plants and flowers, 'tis
reasonable to suppose he did; and the love he had so early and late
discovered toward it, was completed in the delightful practice thereof."He further says, " his elaborate and ingenious pen has not a little
added to the nobleness of our subject."[65] His works were published in
1 vol.folio, 1686, with his portrait, engraved by White.His portrait
appears also to his "Certain Miscellany Tracts," 8vo.A list of his
numerous works may be seen in the Biogr.Dictionaires, or in Watts's
Bibl.It is so masterly written, that it is impossible to give even an
abstract.Kippis has, however, in part, transcribed it.He was
chosen Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, as a man _virtute
et literas ornatissimus_.In 1671, he received the honour of Knighthood
from Charles II., a prince, (says Dr.Johnson) "who, with many frailties
and vices, had yet skill to discover excellence, and virtue to reward it
with such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him nothing, yet,
conferred by a king so judicious and so much beloved, had the power of
giving merit new lustre and greater popularity."Thus he lived in high
reputation, till, in his seventy-sixth year, an illness, which tortured
him a week, put an end to his life, at Norwich, on his birth-day,
October 19, 1682."Some of his last words (we are told by _Whitefoot_)
were expressions of submission to the will of God, and fearlessness of
death."Johnson observes, "It is not on the praises of others, but
on his own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of posterity;
of which he will not be easily deprived, while learning shall have any
reverence among men: for there is no science in which he does not
discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or
sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have cultivated
with success.His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of ideas,
sometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning, and the clearness of
his decisions.On whatever subject he employed his mind, there started
up immediately so many images before him, that he lost one by grasping
another.His memory supplied him with so many illustrations, parallel or
dependent notions, that he was always starting into collateral
considerations.But the spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives
delight; and the reader follows him, without reluctance, through his
mazes, of themselves flowery and pleasing, and ending at the point
originally in view.There remains yet an objection against the writings
of _Browne_, more formidable than the animadversions of criticism.There
are passages from which some have taken occasion to rank him among
deists, and others among atheists.It would be difficult to guess how
any such conclusion should be formed, had not experience shewn that
there are two sorts of men willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidels.When _Browne_ has been numbered among the contemners of religion by the
fury of its friends, or the artifices of its enemies, it is no difficult
task to replace him among the most zealous professors of christianity.He may perhaps, in the ardour of his imagination, have hazarded an
expression, which a mind intent upon faults may interpret into heresy,
if considered apart from the rest of his discourse; but a phrase is not
to be opposed to volumes.There is scarcely a writer to be found, whose
profession was not divinity, that has so frequently testified his belief
of the sacred writings, has appealed to them with such unlimited
submission, or mentioned them with such unvaried reverence."His portrait by Nanteuil, and that by Kneller, holding
his _Sylva_ in his hand, are well engraved in Mr.The
following remark is from the Quarterly Review, in its review of the same
work, in 1818:--"At four years old he was taught to read by the parish
school-master, whose school was over the church porch; and 'at six his
picture was drawn by one Chanteral, no ill painter.'If this portrait,
as is not unlikely, be preserved in the family, it should have been
engraved for the present work; it would have been very interesting to
compare the countenance of such a person, in childhood, in the flower of
years, when his head was engraved by Nanteuil, and in ripe old age, when
he sat to Sir G.Evelyn, and his family, and he gives a
list of his works.He says "his picture was thrice drawn in oil; first,
in 1641, by one Vanderborcht, brought out of Germany at the same time
with Hollar, the graver, by the Earl of Arundel; a second time in 1648,
by Walker; and the third time by Sir G. Kneller, for his friend Mr.Pepys, of the Admiralty, of which that at the Royal Society is a copy.There is a print of him by Nanteuil, who likewise drew him more than
once in black and white, with Indian ink; and a picture, in crayon, by
Luterel."Evelyn lived in the busy times of Charles I., Cromwell,
Charles II., James II., and William.He had much personal intercourse
with Charles II.and James II., and was in the habits of great intimacy
with many of the ministers of those two monarchs, and of the eminent men
of those days.Foreigners, distinguished for learning or arts, who came
to England, did not leave it without visiting him.His manners we may
presume to have been of the most agreeable kind, for his company was
sought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own
tables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house.Evelyn
lived to the great age of eighty-six, and wished these words to be
inscribed on his tomb:--"all is vanity that is not honest, and there is
no solid wisdom but in real piety."[66] Cowley, in a letter to him,
says, "I know nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do
in your garden; and yet no man who makes his happiness more publick, by
a free communication of the art and knowledge of it to others.All that
I myself am able yet to do, is only to recommend to mankind the search
of that felicity, which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy."The
Quarterly Review thus speaks of his _Sylva_:--"The Sylva remained a
beautiful and enduring memorial of his amusements, his occupations, and
his studies, his private happiness, and his public virtues.The greater
part of the woods, which were raised in consequence of Evelyn's
writings, have been cut down; the oaks have borne the British flag to
seas and countries which were undiscovered when they were planted, and
generation after generation has been coffined in the elms.The trees of
his age, which may yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay
and dissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation,
like the trees of an Indian Paradise, exists, and will continue to exist
in full strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time."of Gardening, thus speaks of him:--"Evelyn is
universally allowed to have been one of the warmest friends to
improvements in gardening and planting, that has ever appeared.He is
eulogized by Wotton, in his _Reflections on Ancient and Modern
Learning_, as having done more than all former ages."Switzer calls him
"that good esquire, the king of gardeners."Walpole)
"was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction, and
benevolence.He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and
benefit to mankind; in those of others, laziness and inutility."There appears the following more modern publications respecting Mr.Sylva, with Notes by Hunter; in 4to, and 8vo.Another edition, in 2
vols., 4to.Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings, collected and edited, with Notes, by
Mr.Forming a Supplement to the Evelyn Memoirs.of Gardening enumerates the whole of Mr.Johnson in his History of
English Gardening.[67]

ABRAHAM COWLEY.That in Bishop
Hurd's edition is very neat.This same portrait is also well engraved
for Ankars's edition of Cowley; and also in that by Aikens, in 8vo.Dean
Sprat has prefixed to his edition of Cowley, his portrait, engraved by
Faithorne, and, in his preface, pays a warm and just tribute to his
memory.When his death was announced to Charles II., he declared, that
Mr.Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England.Cowley
addresses his chapter _Of Gardens_ (which strongly paints his delight in
them) to Mr.He wrote this epitaph for himself:--

   From life's superfluous cares enlarg'd,
   His debt of human toil discharg'd,
   Here COWLEY lies, beneath this shed,
   To ev'ry worldly interest _dead_:
   With decent poverty content;
   His hours of ease not idly spent;
   To fortune's goods a foe profess'd,
   And, hating wealth, by all caress'd.'Tis sure he's _dead_; for, lo!how small
   A spot of earth is now his all!wish that earth may lightly lay,
   And ev'ry care be far away!Bring flow'rs, the short-liv'd roses bring,
   To _life deceased_ fit offering!And sweets around the poet strow,
   Whilst yet with life his ashes glow.JOHN ROSE, head gardener to the Lord Essex, at Essex-house, in the
Strand.He sent him to study the celebrated beauties in the gardens of
Versailles.He became afterwards the chief gardener to Charles II., at
the royal gardens in St.His portrait may be seen at
Kensington, in an oil painting, where he is presenting a pine to his
Majesty, whilst on a visit to the Duchess of Cleveland, at Downey Court,
Buckinghamshire.It has lately been engraved in mezzotinto.He was the
author of "The English Vineyard Vindicated, and the Way of Making Wine
in France;" first printed with Evelyn's French Gardener, in 1672, 12mo.Other editions in 1675, 1676, and 1690, in 8vo.The preface is by
Evelyn, as well as The Art of Making Wine.Rose brought to great
perfection dwarf fruit trees, in the gardens at Hampton Court, Carlton,
and Marlborough House.Switzer thus speaks of him:--"He was esteemed to
be the best of his profession in those days, and ought to be remembered
for the encouragement he gave to a servant of his, that has since made
the greatest figure that ever yet any gardener did, I mean Mr.Rose may be well ranked amongst the greatest virtuosos of that time,
(now dead) who were all well pleased to accept of his company while
living."He published "The Planter's Manual," 12mo.There
is prefixed to it a rural frontispiece, by Van Houe.Johnson
properly calls him "one of the _Scriptores minores_ of horticulture."His "devoted attachment to Izaak Walton, forms the best evidence we have
of his naturally amiable disposition."Major's extensively illustrated and most attractive editions of
the Angler; a delightful book, exhibiting a "matchless picture of rural
nature."Cotton's portrait is also well engraved in Zouch's Life of
Walton; and in the many other curious and embellished editions of Walton
and Cotton's Angler.He translated with such truth and spirit, the
celebrated Essays of Montaigne, that he received from that superior
critic, the Marquis of Halifax, a most elegant encomium.Sir John
Hawkins calls it "one of the most valuable books in the English
language."Cotton's works appears in Watts's
Bibl.When describing, in his _Wonders of the Peake_, the Queen
of Scot's Pillar, he thus breaks out:--

   Illustrious _Mary_, it had happy been,
   Had you then found a cave like this to skreen
   Your sacred person from those frontier spies,
   That of a sovereign princess durst make prize,
   When Neptune too officiously bore
   Your cred'lous innocence to this faithless shore.once who hadst the only fame
   Of being kind to all who hither came
   For refuge and protection, how couldst thou
   So strangely alter thy good nature now,
   Where there was so much excellence to move,
   Not only thy compassion, but thy love?'Twas strange on earth, save _Caledonian_ ground,
   So impudent a villain could be found,
   Such majesty and sweetness to accuse;
   Or, after that, a judge would not refuse
   Her sentence to pronounce; or that being done,
   Even amongst bloody'st hangmen, to find one
   Durst, though her face was veil'd, and neck laid down,
   Strike off the fairest head e'er wore a crown.And what state policy there might be here,
   Which does with right too often interfere,
   I'm not to judge: yet thus far dare be bold,
   A fouler act the sun did ne'er behold.[68]

Plott, in his Staffordshire, calls Mr.Cotton "his worthy, learned, and
most ingenious friend."Sir John Hawkins thus speaks of him:--"He was
both a wit and a scholar; of an open, cheerful, and hospitable temper;
endowed with fine talents for conversation, and the courtesy and
affability of a gentleman."He farther thus speaks of one of his
poems:--"It is not for their courtly and elegant turn, that the verses
of Charles Cotton ought to be praised; there is such a delightful flow
of feeling and sentiment, so much of the best part of our nature mixed
up in them, and so much fancy displayed, that one of our most
distinguished living poets has adduced several passages of his Ode upon
Winter, for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy."He
must have possessed many endearing qualities, for the benevolent and
pious Walton thus concludes a letter to his "most honoured friend,
Charles Cotton, Esq.:"--"though I be more than a hundred miles from you,
and in the eighty-third year of my age, yet I will forget both, and next
month begin a pilgrimage to beg your pardon: for I would die in your
favour, and till then will live, Sir, your most affectionate father and
friend, Isaac Walton."One cannot wonder at the good old man wishing to
visit the courteous and well-bred Mr.Cotton, and to enjoy the
intercourse of hospitable urbanity, near the pastoral streams of the
Dove, when he had received such an invitation as the following,
addressed to his "dear and most worthy friend, Mr.Isaac Walton:"--

   Whilst in this cold and blustering clime,
     Where bleak winds howl and tempests roar,
   We pass away the roughest time
     Has been of many years before;

   Whilst from the most tempestuous nooks
     The chillest blasts our peace invade,
   And by great rains our smallest brooks
     Are almost navigable made;

   Whilst all the ills are so improved,
     Of this dead quarter of the year,
   That even you, so much beloved,
     We would not now wish with us here;

   In this estate, I say, it is
     Some comfort to us to suppose,
   That, in a better clime than this,
     You, our dear friend, have more repose;

   And some delight to me the while,
     Though nature now does weep in rain,
   To think that I have seen her smile,
     And haply may I do again.If the all-ruling Power please
     We live to see another May,
   We'll recompense an age of these
     Foul days in one fine fishing day.We then shall have a day or two,
     Perhaps a week, wherein to try
   What the best master's hand can do
     With the most deadly killing fly:

   A day with not too bright a beam,
     A warm, but not a scorching sun,
   A southern gale to curl the stream,
     and, master, half our work is done.There, whilst behind some bush we wait
     The scaly people to betray,--
   We'll prove it just, with treacherous bait
     To make the preying _Trout_ our prey.And think ourselves, in such an hour,
     Happier than those, though not so high,
   Who, like _Leviathans_, devour
     Of meaner men the smaller fry.This, my best friend, at my poor home
     Shall be our pastime and our theme;
   But then--should you not deign to come,
     You make all this a flattering dream.In wandering over the lovely scenes, the pleasant brooks, the
flower-bespangled meadows, which the moral pages of Isaac Walton so
unaffectedly delineate, it is impossible not to recur to the name of the
late author of _Salmonia_, and to reflect, that on these pages he oft
unbended his vigorous mind from his severe and brilliant discoveries.We
can now only lament the (almost) premature death of this high-ranked
philosopher, this great benefactor to the arts, and deep promoter of
science, whose mortal remains were consigned to his unostentatious tomb,
at Geneva, in one of the finest evenings of summer, followed by the
eloquent and amiable historian, De Sismondi, and by other learned and
illustrious men.One may apply to his last moments at Geneva, (where he
had arrived only one day before) these lines of his own favourite
Herbert:--

   _Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
     The bridal of the earth and sky,
   Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night,
     For thou must die!_[69]


SAMUEL GILBERT'S portrait is prefixed to his "Florist's Vade Mecum;"
12mo.In his "Gardener's Almanack," is a particular description of the
roses cultivated in the English gardens at that period.He was the
author of "Fons Sanitatis, or the Healing Spring at Willowbridge Wells."He was son-in-law to John Rea, the author of Flora, and who planned the
gardens at Gerard's Bromley.Willowbridge Wells are at a little distance
from where these once superb gardens were.JACOB BOBART, the elder, is an admirable portrait, by D. Loggan, taken
at his age of eighty-one, and engraved by Burghers.Beneath the head, which is dated 1675, is this
distich:--

   _Thou Germane prince of plants, each year to thee,
   Thousands of subjects grant a subsidy._

It is a venerable countenance, of deep thought.Richardson re-engraved
this among his Illustrations to Granger.Granger mentions also a
whole-length of Bobart in a garden, dog, goat, &c.of
Gardening says, "Bobart's descendants are still in Oxford, and known as
coach proprietors."The
munificence of the Earl of Danby placed Bobart in the physic garden at
Oxford, in 1632, as supervisor; and this garden flourished many years
under his care, and that of his son Jacob, whose zeal and diligence Dr.The elder Bobart was the author of the _Hortus
Oxoniensis_, 1648.Wood, in his Athenae, informs us, that "Jacob Bobart
died in his garden-house, in February, 1679, whereupon his body was
buried in the church of St.He left two sons, _Jacob_ and
_Tillemant_.Tillemant became a master coachman between Oxford and
London, but having had the misfortune to break his leg, became one of
the beadles of the university.Nicholls's late
curious work on autographs, among other _albums_, in the British Museum,
it mentions that of David Krein, in which is the autograph of Jacob
Bobart, with these verses;--

             ----"virtus sua gloria.Think that day lost whose descending sun
   Views from thy hand no noble action done.Yr success and happyness
               is sincerely wished by
                     Ja.It appears from Ray's History of Plants, that Jacob Bobart, the son, was
a frequent communicator to him of scarce plants.It was this son who
published the second volume of Morrison's Oxford History of Plants, who
wrote its excellent preface, and who engaged _Burghers_ to engrave many
of the new plants; which engravings are highly commended by Pulteney.Johnson, in page 148 of his History of Gardening, thus pays Bobart a
high compliment:--"a phalanx of botanists were then contemporaries,
which previous ages never equalled, nor succeeding ones surpassed.Ray,
Tournefort, Plumier, Plukenet, Commelin, Rivinus, _Bobart_, Petiver,
Sherard, Boccone, Linnaeus, may be said to have lived in the same age."His portrait is engraved by Vertue, from after Verelst,
and prefixed to his translation of _Rapin on Gardens_, 8vo.I believe he also wrote
"On the Beatitudes;" 2 vols.Switzer says, that this "incomparable
Latin poem was translated by an ingenious and worthily dignified
clergyman, and a great lover of gardening, Mr.Gardiner, Sub-Dean of
Lincoln."He became afterwards (I believe) Bishop of Lincoln; and a
Latin epitaph on this bishop is in Peck's _Desid.Curiosa._ There is a
print of "Jacobus Gardiner, Episc.Lincoln," engraved by George White,
from after Dahl.Vanderbane's engraving, from Sir Peter Lely's, is particularly fine.Vertue's engravings, from Sir Peter, in the folio editions of 1720 and
1740, are also fine.This same portrait is neatly engraved in the late
Mr.Houbraken has also engraved the same
for Birch's Lives.Sir William Temple, after spending twenty years in
negociations with foreign powers, retired in 1680 from public life, and
employed his time in literary pursuits.He was ambassador for many years
at the court of Holland, and there acquired his knowledge and taste in
gardening.He had a garden at Sheen, and afterwards, another at Moor
Park, where he died in 1700; and though his body was buried in
Westminster Abbey, his heart was enclosed in a silver urn under a
sun-dial in the latter garden.His Essay "Upon the Gardens of Epicurus,
or of Gardening in the year 1685," is printed in all the editions of his
works.[70] These works are published in 2 vols.Switzer, in his History of Gardening, first published in 1715, says,
"That he was a great lover of gardening, appears by his own writings,
and several kinds of fruit brought over by him out of Holland, &c. as
well as by the testimony of his neighbours _yet living_, the greatest
consolation of his life being, in the lucid intervals he had from public
employs, in his beloved gardens at _Sheen_."And, in his Fruit Gardener
he says, that "the magnificence and generosity of this great lover of
planting, distributed vast numbers of the finest grapes among the
nurserymen about London, as well as amongst the nobility and gentry."Lord Mountmorris thus speaks of him:--"The retirement of this great man
has bequeathed the most invaluable legacy to posterity.Of the taste and
elegance of his writings too much can never be said, illuminated as they
are by that probity and candour which pervade them, and those charms
which render truth irresistible.Though other writers may be more the
objects of imitation to the scholar, yet his style is certainly the best
adapted to the politician and the man of fashion; nor would such an
opinion be given, were it not for an anecdote of Swift, which I had from
the late Mr.Sheridan, who told me the dean always recommended him as
the best model, and had repeatedly said that the style of Sir William
Temple was the easiest, the most liberal, and the most brilliant
in our language.In a word, when we consider his probity, his
disinterestedness, his contempt of wealth, the genuine beauty of his
style, which was as brilliant, as harmonious, and as pure as his life
and manners; when we reflect upon the treasures which he has bequeathed
by his example and by his works to his country, which no man ever loved
better, or esteemed more; we cannot avoid considering Sir William Temple
as one of the greatest characters which has appeared upon the political
stage; and he may be justly classed with the greatest names of
antiquity, and with the most brilliant characters which adorn and
illustrate the Grecian or Roman annals."Mason, in his English
Garden, contrasts Sir William's idea of "a perfect garden," with those
of Lord Bacon, and Milton; but he candidly says,

                        ----and yet full oft
   O'er Temple's studious hour did truth preside,
   Sprinkling her lustre o'er his classic page;
   There hear his candour own, in fashion's spite,
   In spite of courtly dulness hear it own,
   _There is a grace in wild variety
   Surpassing rule and order._ Temple, yes,
   There is a grace; and let eternal wreaths
   Adorn their brows who fixt its empire here."He then, in glowing lines, pays an animated tribute to Addison, Pope,
and Kent.Hume records that "he was full of honour and humanity."Sir
William thus concludes one of his philosophic essays:--"When this is
done, human life is, at the greatest and the best, but like a froward
child, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet
till it falls asleep, and then the care is over."His garden was one of
his last delights.He knew what kind of life was best fitted to make a
man's last days happy.Walpole, though he censures Sir William's
warm panegyric on the garden at Moor Park, yet scruples not doing him
full justice, in styling him an excellent man, and an admired writer,
whose style, as to his garden, is animated with the colouring and glow
of poetry.Cobbett, in his _English Gardener_, thus deplores the
fate of Moor Park:--"This really wise and excellent man, Sir W. Temple,
who, while he possessed the soundest judgment, and was employed in some
of the greatest concerns of his country, so ardently, yet so rationally
and unaffectedly, praises the pursuits of gardening, in which he
delighted from his youth to his old age; and of his taste in which, he
gave such delightful proofs in those gardens and grounds at Moor Park,
beneath the turf of one spot of which, he caused by his will, his heart
to be buried, and which spot, together with all the rest of the
beautiful arrangement, has been torn about and disfigured within the
last fifty years, by a succession of wine merchants, spirit merchants,
West Indians, and God knows what besides."And, in his _Woodlands_, he
says, "I have stood for hours, when a little boy, looking at this object
(the canal and borders of beautiful flowers at Moor Park); I have
travelled far since, and have seen a great deal; but I have never seen
any thing of the gardening kind so beautiful in the whole course of my
life."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, after noticing
many general particulars of Sir William, devotes an interesting page to
Sir William's attachment to gardening; and every line in this generous
page, betrays his own delight in this art.He thus concludes this
page:--"Nothing can demonstrate more fully the delight he took in
gardening, than the direction left in his will, that his heart should be
buried beneath the sun-dial of his garden, at Moor Park, near Farnham,
in Surrey.In accordance with which, it was deposited there in a silver
box, affording another instance of the ruling passion unweakened even in
death.Nor was this an unphilosophical clinging to that which it was
impossible to retain; but rather that grateful feeling, common to our
nature, of desiring finally to repose where in life we have been happy.In his garden, Sir William Temple had spent the calmest hours of a
well-spent life, and where his heart had been most peaceful, he wished
its dust to mingle, and thus, at the same time, offering his last
testimony to the sentiment, that in a garden

   _Hic secura quies, et nescia fallere vita._"

JOHN LOCKE wrote "Observations upon the Growth of Vines and Olives; the
Production of Silk, the Preservation of Fruits.Written at the request
of the Earl of Shaftesbury; now first printed from the original
manuscript in the possession of the present Earl of Shaftesbury, 1s.Among the many portraits we have of this learned man, the
public are indebted to Lord King, for having prefixed to his Life of Mr.Locke, a very fine portrait of him, from after Greenhill.This great and
good man possessed, in the highest degree, those virtues that have
given him a claim to the highest rank in the admiration of posterity.In
Rutter's delineations of a part of Somersetshire, he gives a neat
wood-cut of the cottage at Wrington, wherein Locke was born, and he
informs us, that in the garden belonging to Mrs.Hannah More, near that
village, she has placed an urn commemorative of Locke, which was a gift
to her from the justly celebrated Mrs.He was drawn also by
Kneller.Bromley gives a list of many of his engraved portraits.Houbraken engraved one for Birch's Lives.Vertue gave two engravings
from Kneller.WILLIAM FLEETWOOD, successively Bishop of St.Asaph and Ely, and who
died in 1723, was author of "Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry
and Gardening," 8vo.His portrait is prefixed to his "Sermons on
the Relative Duties," 8vo.1716; and also to his "Essay on the
Miracles."His works were published in a collected form in 1 vol.He was incontestibly the best preacher in his time.Doddridge
calls him "silver tongued."Pope's line of

   _The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence_,

might, no doubt, have been justly applied to him.Drake, in the
third volume of his Essays, to illustrate the Tatler, Spectator, and
Guardian, has some interesting pages respecting him.His benevolent
heart and exemplary life, added great effect to his persuasive eloquence
in the pulpit."His sermons (says Lempriere), and divinity tracts, were
widely circulated; but the firmness of his opinions drew upon him the
censure of the House of Commons.His preface to his sermons on the
deaths of Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, and of William, and on the
accession of Anne, gave such offence to the ministry, that the book was
publicly burnt in 1712; but it was more universally read, and even
appeared in the Spectator, No.Johnson
remarked, that fire is a conclusive, but not a convincing argument; it
will certainly destroy any book, but it refutes none.[71] In an
_Obituary_, preserved in Peck's Desid.Curiosa, it thus mentions the
death of a Jeffery Fleetwood, "leaving a wife and six little children
behind him.One of these little children was the famous
William Fleetwood, Bishop of Ely."JOSEPH ADDISON, Esq.There is an original portrait of this eminent man,
at Holland House.Noble's continuation of Granger
enumerates several engravings of him, from Kneller's portraits.Dayl,
the painter, also drew him.In
Ireland's "Picturesque Views on the River Avon," he gives an interesting
description of Mr.Addison's house at Bilton, near Rugby, two miles from
Dunchurch; with a view of the same.The house "remains precisely in the
state it was at the decease of its former possessor, nor has the
interior suffered much change in its former decoration.The furniture
and pictures hold their places with an apparent sacred attention to his
memory.Among the latter, are three of himself, at different periods of
his life; in each of which is strongly marked with the pencil, the ease
of the gentleman, and the open and ingenuous character of the friend to
humanity."Drake's Biographical Sketch of Addison, it appears,
that these portraits were still remaining in his house in 1797.A copy
of the above view is given in the Monthly Magazine for February, 1822,
and it there says, that "the spacious gardens retain the fashion of the
age of the Spectator."The origin of the modern style of landscape
gardening, or the first writers on that subject, were unquestionably Mr.414 and 477 of the _Spectator_, and Mr.Pope in his
celebrated _Guardian_.The first artists who practised in this style,
were Bridgman and Kent.Addison's pure taste on these subjects
is visible even where he prefers Fontainebleau to the magnificent
Versailles, in his paper in the _Guardian_, No.101:--"It is situated
among rocks and woods, that give you a fine variety of savage prospects.The king has humoured the genius of the place, and only made use of so
much art as is necessary to help and regulate nature, without reforming
her too much.The cascades seem to break through the clefts and cracks
of rocks that are covered over with moss, and look as if they were piled
upon one another by accident.There is an artificial wildness in the
meadows, walks, and canals; and the garden, instead of a wall, is fenced
on the lower end by a natural mound of rock-work that strikes the eye
very agreeably.For my part, I think there is something more charming in
these rude heaps of stone than in so many statues, and would as soon see
a river winding through woods and meadows, as when it is tossed up in so
many whimsical figures at Versailles."414 of his Spectator, he
says, "English gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in
France, and Italy, where we see a large extent of ground covered over
with an agreeable mixture of garden, and forest, which represent every
where an artificial rudeness, much more charming than that neatness and
elegancy which we meet with in those of our own country."Murphy
thus compares Addison with Johnson:--"Addison lends grace and ornament
to truth; Johnson gives it force and energy.Addison makes virtue
amiable; Johnson represents it as an awful duty."Addison has been
called the English Fenelon.Johnson calls him the Raphael of essay
writers.The imposing and commanding attitude of the statue erected a
few years since in the Poets' Corner, seems to have arisen, and to have
been devoted to his memory, from his _Reflections on the Tombs in the
Abbey_.Those reflections I here subjoin; and I am sure my reader will
agree with me, that I could not offer a purer honour to his genius and
memory:--"No.26, Friday, March 30._Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
     Regumque turres, O beate sexti.Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam,
     Jam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes,
   Et domus exilis Plutonia._--HOR.With equal foot, rich friend, impartial fate
   Knocks at the cottage, and the palace gate:
   Life's span forbids thee to extend thy cares,
   And stretch thy hopes beyond thy tender years:
   Night soon will seize, and you must quickly go
   To storied ghosts, and _Pluto's_ house below.--CREECH."When I am in a serious humour, I very often walk by myself in
Westminster Abbey; where the gloominess of the place, and the use to
which it is applied, with the solemnity of the building, and the
condition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a
kind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulness, that is not disagreeable.I yesterday passed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloisters,
and the church, amusing myself with the tomb-stones and inscriptions
that I met with in those several regions of the dead.Most of them
recorded nothing else of the buried person, but that he was born upon
one day and died upon another: the whole history of his life being
comprehended in those two circumstances, that are common to all mankind.I could not but look upon these registers of existence, whether of brass
or marble, as a kind of satire upon the departed persons; who had left
no other memorial of them, but that they were born and that they died.They put me in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of
heroic poems, who have sounding names given them, for no other reason
but that they may be killed, and are celebrated for nothing but being
knocked on the head._Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque._--VIRG."The life of these men is finely described in holy writ by _the path of
an arrow_, which is immediately closed up and lost.Upon my going into
the church, I entertained myself with the digging of a grave; and saw in
every shovel-full of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or
skull intermixed with a kind of fresh mouldering earth that some time or
other had a place in the composition of an human body.Upon this I began
to consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay
confused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral; how men
and women, friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks and
prebendaries, were crumbled amongst one another, and blended together in
the same common mass; how beauty, strength, and youth, with old age,
weakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous
heap of matter.After having thus surveyed this great magazine of
mortality, as it were in the lump; I examined it more particularly by
the accounts which I found on several of the monuments which are raised
in every quarter of that ancient fabrick.Some of them were covered with
such extravagant epitaphs, that if it were possible for the dead person
to be acquainted with them, he would blush at the praises which his
friends have bestowed upon him.There are others so excessively modest,
that they deliver the character of the person departed in _Greek_ or
_Hebrew_, and by that means are not understood once in a twelvemonth.In
the poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and
monuments which had no poets.I observed indeed that the present war had
filled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments, which had
been erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were buried in the
plains of _Blenheim_, or in the bosom of the ocean.I could not but be
very much delighted with several modern epitaphs, which are written with
great elegance of expression and justness of thought, and therefore do
honour to the living as well as to the dead.As a foreigner is very apt
to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation from the
turn of their public monuments and inscriptions, they should be
submitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are
put in execution.Sir_Cloudesly Shovel's_ monument has very often given
me great offence: instead of the brave rough _English_ admiral, which
was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man, he is
represented on his tomb by the figure of a beau, dressed in a long
periwig, and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of
state.The inscription is answerable to the monument; for, instead of
celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service
of his country, it acquaints us only with the manner of his death, in
which it was impossible for him to reap any honour.The _Dutch_, whom we
are apt to despise for want of genius, shew an infinitely greater taste
of antiquity and politeness in their buildings and works of this nature,
than what we meet with in those of our own country.The monuments of
their admirals, which have been erected at the public expense, represent
them like themselves; and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval
ornaments, with beautiful festoons of sea-weed, shells, and coral.I have left the repository of our English
kings for the contemplation of another day, when I shall find my mind
disposed for so serious an amusement.I know that entertainments of this
nature are apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds, and
gloomy imaginations; but, for my own part, though I am always serious,
I do not know what it is to be melancholy; and can therefore take a view
of nature in her deep and solemn scenes, with the same pleasure as in
her most gay and delightful ones.By this means I can improve myself
with those objects which others consider with terror.When I look upon
the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read
the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I
meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-stone, my heart melts with
compassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider
the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: When I see
kings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed
side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with their contests
and disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little
competitions, factions, and debates of mankind.When I read the several
dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred
years ago, I consider that great day when we shall all of us be
contemporaries, and make our appearance together.JOHN LAWRENCE published "The Clergyman's Recreation, shewing the
Pleasure and Profit of the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.Also a poem,
called "Paradise Regained, or the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.The
sixth edition of "The Clergyman's Recreation" has "the effigies of the
author, engraved by Vertue."I have seen eight copies of this sixth
edition, and in neither of them has this portrait been.No doubt the
collecting to form Granger's, has deprived each copy of
