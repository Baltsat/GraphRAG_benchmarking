There was no better fighter
with legitimate weapons, but she saw how closely the claim to do wrong
that good might come was related to anarchy, and her sense of true
citizenship was outraged by law-breaking which, to her clear judgment,
could only <DW44> the ultimate triumph of a cause rooted in all that
was just and righteous.She was not confused by any cross-currents
of admiration for individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one
desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’ of all those who
belonged to the forces of disintegration.She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and her fearless pursuit
after integrity in deed and in word.When the moment came when she was
to go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of many, she went
in the strength of the Suffrage women of Scotland.They were her shield
and buckler, and their loyal support of her work and its ideals was
her exceeding great reward.Without their organised strength she could
never have called into existence those units and their equipment which
have justly earned the praises of nations allied in arms.With the rise of the militant movement, the whole Suffrage cause
passed through a cloud of opprobrium and almost universal objurgation.Women were all tarred with the same stick, and fell under one
condemnation.It is now of little moment to recall this, except in as
much as it affected Elsie Inglis.The Scottish Suffrage societies, who
gave their organisation and their workers to start the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, found that the community desired to forget the unpopular
Suffrage, and to remember only the Scottish Hospitals.Inglis was doing were asked to avoid ‘the common cause.’
No one who knew her would consent to deny by implication one of the
deepest mainsprings of her work.The Churches were equally timid in
aught that gave comfort or consolation to those who were loyal to their
Christian social ideal for women.No organised society owes more to the
administrative work of women than does the Christian Church throughout
the world.No body of administrators have been slower to perceive that
women in responsible positions would be a strength to the Church than
have been the clergy of the Church.The writer of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_
puts into the mouth of the clerical type of that day the argument
that the Old Testament gave an historic basis for the enslavement of
races, and St.The
spirit of Christianity has raised women from a ‘low estate,’ and women
owe everything to the results of Christianity; but the ecclesiastical
mind has never shaken off the belief that they are under a special
curse from the days of Eden, and that St.Paul’s outlook on women
in his day was the last revelation as to their future position in a
jealously-guarded corporation.Which of us, acquainted with the Church
history of our day, but remembers the General Assembly when the women
missionaries were first invited to stand by their fellow-workers and be
addressed by the Moderator on their labours and sufferings in a common
cause?It was a great shock to the fathers and brethren that their sex
should not disqualify them from standing in the Assembly, which would
have more democratic weight in the visible Church on earth if some of
its elected lay members were women serving in the courts of the Church.In this matter and in many others concerning women, the Church is not
yet triumphant over its prejudices bedded in the geological structure
of Genesis.In all periods of the enfranchisement struggle there were individual
clergy who aided women with their warm advocacy and the helpful
direction of thought.Elsie Inglis was a leader of this movement in its
connection with a high Christian ideal of the citizenship of women.Margaret’s, the church of Parliament in
history, to commemorate all her works begun and ended as a member of
Christ’s Church here on earth, it was fitting that Bishop Gore, who had
so consistently upheld the cause, should speak of her work as one who
had helped to win the equality of women in a democratic, self-governing
State.This memoir would utterly fail to reproduce a picture of Dr.Inglis if
it did not emphasise how her spirit was led and disciplined, tempered
and steeled, through this long and fiery trial to the goal of a leading
ideal.The contest trained her for her splendid achievements in
overcoming all obstacles in ministering to the sufferings of nations,
‘rightly struggling to be free.’ Her friend, Miss Wright, says:--

 ‘We did not always agree.Many were the arguments we had with her, but
 she was always willing to understand another point of view and willing
 to allow for difference of opinion.She was very fair-minded and
 reasonable, and deplored the excesses of the militant suffragettes.She was in no sense a man-hater; to her the world was composed of men
 and women, and she thought it a mistake to exalt the one unduly over
 the other.She was never embittered by her struggle for the position
 of women.She loved the fight, and the endeavour, and to arrive at any
 point just meant a fresh setting forward to another further goal.‘From her girlhood onward, her effort was to free and broaden life for
 other women, to make the world a better place to live in.‘I had a letter this week from Annie Wilson, Elsie’s great friend.She says, “It seems to me Elsie’s whole life was full of championship
 of the weak, and she was so strong in maintaining what was right.I remember once saying in connection
 with some work I was going to begin, ‘I wonder if I shall be able,’
 and Elsie saying in her bright way, ‘What man has done man can do.’
 I am so glad that she had the opportunity of showing her great
 administrative capacity, and that her power is known and acknowledged.I cannot tell you what it will be not to have
 her welcome to look forward to when I come home.”

 ‘Elsie had in many respects what is, perhaps wrongly, called a man’s
 mind.She was an Imperialist in the very best sense, and had high
 ideals for her country and people.She was a very womanly woman,
 never affecting mannish ways as a pose.If she seemed a strong-minded
 woman it was because she had strenuous work to do.She was never “a
 lone woman.” She was always one of a family, and in the heart of the
 family.Elsie always had the _lovingest_ appreciation and backing from
 her nearest and dearest, and that a wide and varied circle.So, also,
 she did not need to fight for her position; it has been said of her,
 “Whenever she began to speak her pleasant well-bred accent and manner
 gained her a hearing.” She was ever a fighter, but it was because she
 wanted those out in the cold and darkness to come into the love and
 light which she herself experienced and sought after always more fully.‘We looked forward to more frequent meetings when working days were
 done.Now she has gone forward to the great work beyond:

    ‘“Somewhere, surely, afar
    In the sounding labour home vast
    Of being, is practised that strength--
    Zealous, beneficent, firm.”’




CHAPTER VII

THE PROFESSION AND THE FAITH

    ‘Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
    Lift up thine eyes and seek His face;
    Life with its way before us lies,
    Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.’

    ‘Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.’


Elsie Inglis took up practice in Edinburgh, and worked in a happy
partnership with the late Dr.Jessie MacGregor, until the latter left
Scotland for work in America.When the University of Edinburgh admitted women to the examinations for
degrees in medicine, Dr.Inglis graduated M.B., C.M.From that
date onwards her practice, her political and suffrage work, and the
founding of the Hospice in the High Street of Edinburgh, as a nursing
home and maternity centre staffed by medical women, occupied a life
which grew and strengthened amid so many and varied experiences.Her father’s death deprived her of what had been the very centre and
mainspring of her existence.As she records the story of his passing
on, she says that she cannot imagine life without him, and that he had
been so glad to see her begin her professional career.She was not one
to lose her place in the stream of life from any morbid inaction or
useless repining.She shared the spirit of the race from which she had
sprung, a reaching forward to obtain the prize of life fulfilled with
service, and she had inherited the childlike faith and confidence which
inspired their belief in the Father of Spirits.Elsie lost in her father the one who had made her the centre of his
thoughts and of his most loving watchfulness.From the day that her
home with him was left unto her desolate, she was to become a centre to
many of her father’s wide household, and, even as she had learnt from
him, she became a stay and support to many of his children’s children.The two doctors started practice in Atholl Place, and later on they
moved into 8 Walker Street, an abode which will always be associated
with the name of Dr.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘My impressions of their joint house are all pleasant ones.They got
 on wonderfully together, and in every thing seemed to appreciate one
 another’s good qualities.They were very different, and had in many
 ways a different outlook.I remember Jessie saying once, “Elsie is so
 exceptionally generous in her attitude of mind, it would be difficult
 not to get on with her!” They both held their own opinions on various
 subjects without the difference of opinion really coming between them.Elsie said once about the arrangement, “It has all the advantages of
 marriage without any of its disabilities.” We used always to think
 they did each other worlds of good.I know how I always enjoyed a
 visit to them if it was only for an afternoon or some weeks.There was
 such an air of freedom in the whole house.You did what you liked,
 thought what you liked, without any fear of criticism or of being
 misunderstood.‘I do not know much about her practice, as medicine never interested
 me, but I believe at one time, before the Suffrage work engrossed her
 so much, she was making quite a large income.’

Professionally she suffered under two disabilities: the restricted
opportunities for clinical work in the days when she was studying her
profession, combined with the constant interruptions which the struggle
against the medical obstructionists necessitated; secondly, the
various stages in the political fight incident to obtaining that wider
enfranchisement which aimed at freeing women from all those lesser
disabilities which made them the helots of every recognised profession
and industry.When in the Scottish Women’s Hospitals abroad, Dr.Inglis rapidly
acquired a surgical skill, under the tremendous pressure of work, which
often kept her for days at the operating-table, which showed what a
great surgeon she might have been, given equal advantages in the days
of her peace practice.Inglis lost no opportunity of enlarging her knowledge.She was
a lecturer on Gynecology in the Medical College for Women which had
been started later than Dr.Jex Blake’s school, and was on slightly
broader lines.After she had started practice she went to study German
clinics; she travelled to Vienna, and later on spent two months in
America studying the work and methods of the best surgeons in New York,
Chicago, and Rochester.She advocated, at home and abroad, equal opportunities for work
and study in the laboratories for both men and women students.She
maintained that the lectures for women only were not as good as those
provided for the men, and that the women did not get the opportunity
of thorough laboratory practice before taking their exams.She thus
came into conflict with the University authorities, who refused to
accept women medical students within the University, or to recognise
extra-mural mixed classes in certain subjects.‘With a great price’ she might truly say
she had purchased her freedom, and nothing would turn her aside.If
one avenue was closed, try another.If one Principal was adamant,
his day could not last for ever; prepare the way for his successor.Indomitable, unbeaten, unsoured, Dr.Inglis, with the smiling, fearless
brow, trod the years till the influence of the ‘red planet Mars’ opened
to her and others the gate of opportunity.She had achieved many
things, and was far away from her city and its hard-earned practice
when at length, in 1916, the University, under a new ‘open-minded,
generous-hearted Head,’ opened its doors to women medical students.There were other things, besides her practice, which Dr.Inglis
subordinated in these years to the political enfranchisement of women.It has been shown in a previous chapter how keen were her political
beliefs.She joined the Central Edinburgh Women’s Liberal Association
in its earliest organised years.She acted as Vice-President in it for
sixteen years, and was one of its most active members.Gulland, the Liberal Whip, knew the value of her work, and must
have had reason to respect the order in which she placed her political
creed--first the citizenship of women, then the party organisation.He speaks of her fearless partisanship and aloof attitude towards all
local political difficulties.An obstacle to her was a thing to be
overcome, not to be sat down before.Any one in politics who sees what
is right, and cannot understand any reason why the action should not
be straight, rather than compromising, is a help to party agents at
rare intervals; normally such minds cause anxiety.Her secretary, Miss
Cunningham, says about her place in the Liberal organisation:--

 ‘Not only as a speaker--though as that she was invaluable--but as one
 who mixed freely with all our members, with her sympathy, in fact, her
 enthusiasm for everything affecting the good of women, she won respect
 and liking on every side.It was not until she became convinced that
 she could help forward the great cause for women better by being
 unattached to any party organisation that she severed her connection
 with the Liberal Party.Regretted as that severance was by all, we
 understood her point of view so well that we recognised there was no
 other course open to her.Her firm grasp of and clear insight into
 matters political made her a most valued colleague, especially in
 times of difficulty, when her advice was always to be relied upon.’

In 1901 she was a member of the Women’s Liberal League, a branch of
the W.L.A.which split off at the time of the Boer War, in opposition
to the ‘Little Englanders.’ Dr.Inglis was on its first committee, and
lent her drawing-room for meetings, addressing other meetings on the
Imperialist doctrines born in that war.When that phase of politics
ended, the League became an educational body and worked on social and
factory legislation.Among her other enterprises was the founding of the Muir Hall of
Residence for Women Students at the University.Many came up from the
country, and, like herself in former days in Glasgow, had to find
suitable, and in many cases uncomfortable, lodgings.Principal Muir’s old Indian friendship with Mr.Inglis had been most
helpful in former years, and now Lady Muir and other friends of the
women students started a Residence in George Square for them, and
Miss Robertson was appointed its first warden.Secretary to the Muir Hall till she died, and from its start was a
moving spirit in all that stood for the comfort of the students.She
attended them when they were ill, and was always ready to help them
in their difficulties with her keen, understanding advice.The child
of her love, amid all other works, was her Maternity Hospice.Of this
work Miss Mair, who was indeed ‘a nursing mother’ to so many of the
undertakings of women in the healing profession, writes of Dr.Inglis’
feeling with perfect understanding:--

 ‘To Dr.Inglis’ clear vision, even in her early years of student life,
 there shone through the mists of opposition and misunderstandings a
 future scene in which a welcome recognition would be made of women’s
 services for humanity, and with a strong, glad heart she joined with
 other pioneers in treading “the stony way” that leads to most reforms.Once landed on the firm rock of professional recognition, Dr.Inglis
 set about the philanthropic task of bringing succour and helpful
 advice to mothers and young babies and expectant mothers in the
 crowded homes in and about the High Street.There, with the help of a
 few friends, she founded the useful little Hospice that we trust now
 to see so developed and extended by an appreciative public, that it
 will merit the honoured name “The Dr.Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospice.”

 ‘This little Hospice lay very near the heart of its founder--she loved
 it--and with her always sensitive realisation of the needs of the
 future, she was convinced that this was a bit of work on the right
 lines for recognition in years to come.Some of us can recall the
 kindling eye, the inspiring tones, that gave animation to her whole
 being when talking of her loved Hospice.She saw in it a possible
 future that might effect much, not only for its patients, but for
 generations of medical women.’

With Dr.Elsie one idea always started another, and ‘a felt want’ in
any department of life always meant an instantly conceived scheme of
supplying the need.Those who ‘came after’ sometimes felt a breathless
wonder how ways and means could be found to establish and settle the
new idea which had been evolved from the fertile brain.The Hospice
grew out of the establishment of a nursing home for working women,
where they could be cared for near their own homes.Barbour, a house was secured at a nominal rent in
George Square, and opened in 1901.That sphere of usefulness could be
extended if a maternity home could be started in a poorer district.Thus the Hospice in the High Street was opened in 1904.Inglis
devoted herself to the work.An operating theatre and eight beds
were provided.The midwifery department grew so rapidly that after a
few years the Hospice became a centre, one of five in Scotland, for
training nurses for the C.M.B.Inglis looked forward to a greater future for it in infant welfare
work, and she always justified the device of the site as being close
to where the people lived, and in air to which they were accustomed.Trained district nurses visited the people in their own homes, and
in 1910 there were more cases than nurses to overtake them.In that
year the Hospice was amalgamated with Bruntsfield Hospital; medical,
surgical, and gynecological cases were treated there, while the Hospice
was devoted entirely to maternity and infant welfare cases.Inglis’ ‘vision’ was nearly accomplished when she had a small ward
of five beds for malnutrition cases, a baby clinic, a milk depot,
health centres, and the knowledge that the Hospice has the distinction
of being the only maternity centre run by women in Scotland.This
affords women students opportunities denied to them in other maternity
hospitals.A probationer in that Hospice says:--

 ‘Dr.Inglis’ idea was that everything, as far as possible, should
 be made subservient to the comfort of the patients.This was always
 considered when planning the routine.She disapproved of the system
 prevalent in so many hospitals of rousing the patients out of sleep
 in the small hours of the morning in order to get through the work of
 the wards.She would not have them awakened before 6 A.M., and she
 instituted a cup of tea before anything else was done.To her nurses
 she was very just and appreciative of good work, and, if complaints
 were made against any one, the wrongdoing had to be absolutely proved
 before she would take action.She also insisted on the nurses having
 adequate time off, and that it should not be infringed upon.’

These, in outline, are the interests which filled the years after Dr.Of her work among the people living round
her Hospice, it is best told in the words of those who watched for
her coming, and blessed the sound of her feet on their thresholds.Freely she gave them of her best, and freely they gave her the love and
confidence of their loyal hearts.Inglis’ patient for twenty years, and she had
also attended her mother and grandmother.Of several children one
was called Elsie Maud Inglis, and the child was christened in the
Dean Church by Dr.The whole family seem to have been her charge, for when Mrs.B.’s husband returned from the South African War, Dr.Inglis fought
the War Office for nine months to secure him a set of teeth, and,
needless to say, after taking all the trouble entailed by a War Office
correspondence, she was successful.A son fought in the present war,
and when Dr.Inglis saw the death of a Private B., she sent a telegram
to the War Office to make sure it was not the son of Mrs.B. She would
never take any fees from this family.B. gave her
some feathers he had brought home from Africa.She had them put in a
new hat she had got for a wedding, and came round before she went to
the festival to show them to the donor.Her cheery ways ‘helped them
all,’ and when a child of the family broke its leg, and was not mending
all round in the Infirmary, Dr.Inglis was asked to go and see her, and
the child from then ‘went forrit.’

In another family there was some stomach weakness, and three infants
died.Inglis tried hard to save the life of the third, a little
boy, who was evidently getting no nourishment.So anxious was she,
that she asked a sister who had recently had a baby, to try if she
could nurse the child.This was done, the foster mother going every day
to the house, but they could not save the infant.When the next one
arrived, Dr.Inglis was so determined the child should live, she came
every day, whatever were her engagements, to sterilise the milk.The
child throve under her care, and grew up in health.Another of these patients of her care ‘could not control her feelings’
when speaking of the good physician.It was evident the family had
lost their best friend.Inglis’
kindness to them.She would come round, after she had finished her
other work at night, to bath the baby.When another child was ill, she
told the mother not to open the door even if the King himself wished
to come in.The husband said she was so bright one felt the better
for her visit, ‘though her orders had to be obeyed and no mistake,
and she would tell you off at once if you did not carry them out.’ If
they offered payment, she would say, ‘Now, go and buy a nice chop for
yourself.’

Another family had this story.G.: ‘That woman has done more
for the folk living between Morrison Street and the High Street than
all the ministers in Edinburgh and Scotland itself ever did for any
one.She gave her house, her
property, her practice, her money to help others.’ Mrs.G. fell ill
after the birth of one of her children.Elsie came in one night,
made her a cup of tea and some toast, and, as she failed to get well,
she raised money to keep her in a sanatorium for six months.After she
had been there one child, in charge of a friend, fell ill, and finally
died, Dr.Inglis doing all she could to spare the absent mother and
save the child.When it died, she wrote:--

 ‘MY DEAR MRS.G.,--You will have got the news by now.I cannot tell
 you how sorry I am for you, my dear.But you will believe, won’t you,
 that we all did everything we could for your dear little boy.H. and I saw him three times a day
 between us, and yesterday we saw him four times.When I sent you the
 card I hoped the high temperature was due to his teeth, because his
 pulse seemed good.H. telephoned that she was
 afraid that his pulse was flagging, and he died suddenly about one.G. has just been here; you must get well, my dear, for his sake,
 and for the sake of all the other little children.Poor little Johnnie
 has had a great many troubles in his little life has he not?But he
 is over them all now, dear little man.And the God in whose _safe_
 keeping he is, comfort you, dear Mrs.G.--Ever your sincere friend,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

The caretaker of the dispensary in St.Cuthbert’s Mission in Morrison
Street speaks of Dr.Inglis as the true friend of all who needed her.She gave an hour three mornings in the week, and if she could not
overtake all the cases in the time, she would occasionally come back
later in the day.Another of her patients was the mother of twelve children; six of
them were ‘brought home’ by Dr.She was a friend to them all,
and never minded what trouble she took.If they did not send for her,
wishing to spare her, she scolded them for thinking of herself and not
of their need for her services.All the children loved her, and they
would watch from the window on her dispensary days for her, and she
would wave to them across the street.She would often stop them in
the street to ask after their mother, and even after she had been to
Serbia and returned to Edinburgh, she remembered about them and their
home affairs.She always made them understand that her orders must be
carried out.The eldest girl was washing the floor, and Dr.Inglis told her to
go for some medicine.The girl continued to finish the work she was at.Inglis, ‘don’t you know that when I say a thing I
mean it?’ Another time she had told Mrs.C. to remain in her bed till
she came.C. rose to wash the
dishes.Do not touch another dish.’ And she herself helped Mrs.Later on two of the children got scarlet fever, and Dr.Inglis told the
mother she was proud of her, as, through her care, the infection did
not spread in the family or outside it.The people in Morrison Street showed their gratitude by collecting
a little sum of money to buy an electric lamp to light their doctor
friend up the dark staircase of the house.These were the true mourners
who stood round St.Giles’ with the bairns she had ‘brought home’ on
the day when her earthly presence passed from their sight.These were
they who had fitted her for her strenuous enterprises in the day when
the battle was set in array, and these were the people who knew her
best, and never doubted that when called from their midst she would go
forth strong in that spirit which is given to the weak things of the
earth, and that it would be her part to strengthen the peoples that had
no might.The Little Sisters of the Poor had a dispensary of St.Elsie had it in her charge from 1903 to 1913, and the Sister Superior
speaks of the affection of the people and the good work done among them.‘“How often,” writes one in charge of the servant department of the
 Y.W.C.A., “her deliberate tread has brought confidence to me when
 getting heartless over some of these poor creatures who would not
 rouse themselves, judging the world was against them.Many a time
 the patient fighting with circumstances needed a sisterly word of
 cheer which Dr.Inglis supplied, and sent the individual heartened
 and refreshed.The expression on her face, _I mean business_, had
 a wonderful uplift, while her acuteness in exactly describing the
 symptoms to those who were in constant contact gave a confidence which
 made her a power amongst us.”’

A patient has allowed some of her written prescriptions to be quoted.They were not of a kind to be made up by a chemist:--

 ‘I want you never to miss or delay meals.I want you to go to bed at
 a reasonable time and go to sleep early.I want you to do your work
 regularly, and to take an interest in outside things--such as your
 church and suffrage.’

 ‘We should not let these Things (with a capital T) affect us so much.Our cause is too righteous for it to be really affected by them--if we
 don’t weaken.’

 ‘My dear, the potter’s wheel isn’t a pleasant instrument.’

 ‘Go home and say your prayers.’

 ‘Realise what you are, a free born child of the Universe.Perfection
 your Polar Star.’

These stories of her healing of mind and body might be endlessly
multiplied.Sorrow and disease are much the same whether they come to
the rich or the poor, and poverty is not always the worst trial of
many a sad tale.Elsie’s power of sympathy and understanding was
as much called upon in her paying practice as among the very poor.She
made no distinction in what she gave; her friendship was as ready as
her trained skill.There was one patient whose sufferings were largely
due to her own lack of will power.Elsie, after prescribing, bent down
and kissed her.It awoke in the individual the sense that she was not
‘altogether bad,’ and from that day forward there was a newness of life.From what sources of inner strength did she increasingly minister
in that sphere in which she moved?‘Thy touch has still its ancient
power,’ and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting, well-balanced
life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual strength from the deep wells
of Salvation.In these years the kindred points of heaven and home were always
in the background of her life.Her sisters’ homes were near her in
Edinburgh, and when her brother Ernest died in India, in 1910, his
widow and her three daughters came back to her house.Her friendship
and understanding of all the large circle that called her aunt was a
very beautiful tie.The elder ones were near enough to her own age
to be companions to her from her girlhood.Miss Simson says that she
was more like an elder sister to them when she stayed with the family
on their arrival from Tasmania.‘The next thing I remember about her
was when she went to school in Paris, she promised to bring us home
Paris dolls.She asked us how we wanted them dressed, and when she
returned we each received a beautiful one dressed in the manner chosen.Aunt Elsie was always most careful in the choice of presents for each
individual.One always felt that she had thought of and got something
that she knew you wanted.While on her way to Russia she sent me a
cheque because she had not been able to see anything while at home.She
wrote, “This is to spend on something frivolous that you want, and not
on stockings or anything like that.”’

‘It is not her great gifts that I remember now,’ says another of that
young circle, ‘it is that she was always such a darling.’

These nieces were often the companions of Dr.She
had her own ideas as to how these should be spent.She always had
September as her month of recreation.She used to go away, first of
all, for a fortnight quite alone to some out-of-the-way place, when
not even her letters were sent after her.She would book to a station,
get out, and bicycle round the neighbourhood till she found a place
she liked.She wanted scenery and housing accommodation according to
her mind.Her first requirement was hot water for ‘baths.’ If that was
found in abundance she was suited; if it could not be requisitioned,
she went elsewhere.Her paintbox went with her, and when she returned
to rejoin or fetch away her family she brought many impressions of what
she had seen.The holidays were restful because always well planned.She loved enjoyment and happiness, and she sought them in the spirit
of real relaxation and recreation.If weather or circumstances turned
out adverse, she was amused in finding some way out, and if nothing
else could be done she had a power of seeing the ludicrous under all
conditions, which in itself turned the rain-clouds of life into bursts
of sunlight.Inglis gives a happy picture of the life in 8 Walker Street, when
she was the guest of Dr.Her love for the three nieces, the one
in particular who bore her name, and in whose medical education she
deeply interested herself, was great.She used to return from a long day’s work, often late, but with a mind
at leisure from itself for the talk of the young people.However late
she was, a hot bath preluded a dinner-party full of fun and laughter,
the account of all the day’s doings, and then a game of bridge or some
other amusement.Often she would be anxious over some case, but she
used to say, ‘I have done all I know, I can only sleep over it,’ and
to bed and to sleep she went, always using her will-power to do what
was best in the situation.Those who were with her in the ‘retreats’
in Serbia or Russia saw the same quality of self-command.If transport
broke down, then the interval had better be used for rest, in the best
fashion in which it could be obtained.Her Sundays, as far as her profession permitted, were days of rest and
social intercourse with her family and friends.After evening church
she went always to supper in the Simson family, often detained late by
pacings to and fro with her friends, Dr.Wallace Williamson,
engaged in some outpouring of the vital interests which were absorbing
her.One of the members of her household says:--

 ‘We all used to look forward to hearing all her doings in the past
 week, and of all that lay before her in the next.Sunday evening felt
 quite wrong and flat when she was called out to a case and could not
 come to us.Her visit in
 September was the best bit of the holidays to us.She laid herself out
 to be with us in our bathing and golfing and picnics.’

The house was ‘well run.’ Those who know what is the highest meaning
of service, have always good servants, and Dr.Her cooks were all engaged under one stipulation, ‘Hot
water for any number of baths at any time of the day or night,’ and
the hot water never failed under the most exacting conditions.Her
guests were made very comfortable, and there was only one rigid rule
in the house.However late she came downstairs after any night-work,
there was always family prayers before breakfast.The book she used
was _Euchologion_, and when in Russia asked that a copy should be
sent her.Her consulting-room was lined with bookshelves containing
all her father’s books, and of these she never lost sight.Any guest
might borrow anything else in her house and forget to return it, but if
ever one of those books were borrowed, it had to be returned, for the
quest after it was pertinacious.In her dress she became increasingly
particular, but only as the adornment, not of herself, but of the cause
of women as citizens or as doctors.When a uniform became part of her
equipment for work, she must have welcomed it with great enthusiasm.It
is in the hodden grey with the tartan shoulder straps, and the thistles
of Scotland that she will be clothed upon, in the memory of most of
those who recall her presence.It is difficult to write of the things that belong to the Spirit,
and Dr.Elsie’s own reserve on these matters was not often broken.She had been reared in a God-fearing household, and surrounded from
her earliest years with the atmosphere of an intensely devout home.That she tried all things, and approved them to her own conscience,
was natural to her character.Certain doctrines and formulas found no
acceptance with her.Man was created in God’s image, and the Almighty
did not desire that His creatures should despise or underrate the work
of His Hand.The attitude of regarding the world as a desert, and human
beings as miserable sinners incapable of rendering the highest service,
never commended itself to her eminently just mind.Such difficulties of
belief as she may have experienced in early years lay in the relations
of the created to the Creator of all that is divine in man.Till she
had convinced herself that a reasonable service was asked for and would
be accepted, her mind was not completely at rest.In her correspondence
with her father, both in Glasgow and London, her interest was always
living and vital in the things which belonged to the kingdom of heaven
within.She wandered from church to church in both places.Oblivious
of all distinctions she would take her prayer book and go for ‘music’
to the Episcopal Church, or attend the undenominational meetings
connected with the Y.W.C.A.Often she found herself most interested
in the ministry of the Rev.Hunter, who subsequently left Glasgow
for London.There are many shrewd comments on other ministers, on the
‘Declaratory Acts,’ then agitating the Free Church.She thought the
Westminster Confession should either be accepted or rejected, and that
the position was made no simpler by ‘declarations.’ In London she
attended the English Church almost exclusively, listening to the many
remarkable teachers who in the Nineties occupied the pulpits of the
Anglican Church.It was not till after her father’s death that she came
to rest entirely in the ministry of the Church of Scotland, and found
in the teaching and friendship of Dr.Wallace Williamson that which
gave her the vital faith which inspired her life and work, and carried
her at last triumphantly through the swellings of Jordan.Giles’ lay in the centre of her healing mission, and her
alert active figure was a familiar sight, as the little congregation
gathered for the daily service.When the kirk skailed in the fading
light of the short days, the westering sun on the windows would often
fall on the fair hair and bright face of her whose day had been spent
in ministering work.On these occasions she never talked of her work.If she was joined by a friend, Dr.Elsie waited to see what was the
pressing thought in the mind of her companion, and into that she at
once poured her whole sympathy.Few ever walked west with her to
her home without feeling in an atmosphere of high and chivalrous
enterprise.Thus in an ordered round passed the days and years, drawing
ever nearer to the unknown destiny, when that which was to try the
reins and the hearts of many nations was to come upon the world.John travelled to the kitchen.When
that storm burst, Elsie Inglis was among those whose lamp was burning,
and whose heart was steadfast and prepared for the things which were
coming on the earth.ELSIE INGLIS, 1916]




CHAPTER VIII

WAR AND THE SCOTTISH WOMEN

    ‘God the all-terrible King, Who ordainest
      Great winds Thy clarion, the lightnings Thy sword,
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
      Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.God the All-wise, by the fire of Thy chastening
      Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored,
    Through the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hastening,
      Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.’


The year of the war coincided with that period in the life of Dr.Inglis when she was fully qualified for the great part she was to play
among the armies of the Allied nations.It is now admitted that this country was unprepared for war, and
incredulous as to the German menace.The services of women have now
attained so high a value in the State that it is difficult to recast
their condition in 1914.In politics there had been a succession of efforts to obtain
their enfranchisement.Each effort had been marked by a stronger
manifestation in their favour in the country, and the growing force
of the movement, coupled with the unrest in Ireland, had kept all
political organisations in a high state of tension.It has been shown how fully organised were all the Women Suffrage
societies.Committees, organisers, adherents, and speakers were at
work, and in the highest state of efficiency.Women linked by a common
cause had learnt how to work together.The best brains in their midst
were put at the service of the Suffrage, and they had watched in the
political arena where to expect support, and who could be trusted among
the leaders of all parties.No shrewder or more experienced body of
politicians were to be found in the country than those women drawn from
all classes, in all social, professional, and industrial spheres, who
acknowledged Mrs.Fawcett as their leader, and trusted no one party,
sect, or politician in the year 1914.When the war caused a truce to be pronounced in all questions of acute
political difference, the unenfranchised people realised that this
might mean the failure of their hopes for an indefinite time.They
never foresaw that, for the second time within a century, emancipation
was to be bought by the life blood of a generation.The truce made no difference to any section of the Suffrage party.War found both men and women
unprepared, but the path of glory was clear for the men.A great army
must be formed in defence of national liberty.It would have been well had the strength of the women been mobilised in
the same hour.Their long claim for the rights of citizenship made them
keenly alive and responsive to the call of national service.War and its consequences had for many years been uppermost in their
thoughts.In the struggle for emancipation, the great argument they
had had to face among the rapidly decreasing anti-party, was the one
that women could take no part in war, and, as all Government rested
ultimately on brute force, women could not fight, and therefore must
not vote.In countering this outlook, women had watched what war meant all over
the world, wherever it took place.With the use of scientific weapons
of destruction, with the development of scientific methods of healing,
with all that went to the maintenance of armies in the field, and the
support of populations at home, women had some vision in what manner
they would be needed if war ever came to this country.The misfortune of such a controversy as that of the ‘Rights of Women’
is that it necessarily means the opposition has to prove a negative
proposition--a most sterilising process.Political parties were so
anxious to prove that women were incapable of citizenship, that the
whole community got into a pernicious habit of mind.Women were
underrated in every sphere of industry or scientific knowledge.Their
sense of incapacity and irresponsibility was encouraged, and when they
turned militant under such treatment, they were only voted a nuisance
which it was impossible to totally exterminate.Those who watched the gathering war clouds, and the decline of their
Parliamentary hopes, did not realise that, in the overruling providence
of God, the devastating war among nations was to open a new era for
women.They were no longer to be held cheap, as irresponsibles--mere
clogs on the machinery of the State.They were to be called on to
take the place of men who were dying by the thousand for their homes,
fighting against the doctrine that military force is the only true
Government in a Christian world.After mobilisation, military authorities had to make provision for the
wounded.We can remember the early sensation of seeing buildings raised
for other purposes taken over for hospitals.Since the Crimea, women as
nurses at the base were institutions understood of all men.In the vast
camps which sprang up at the commencement of the war, women modestly
thought they might be usefully employed as cooks.The idea shocked the
War Office till it rocked to its foundations.A few adventurous women
started laundries for officers, and others for the men.They did it on
their own, and in peril of their beneficent soap suds, being ordered to
a region where they would be out of sight, and out of any seasonable
service, to the vermin-ridden camps.The Suffrage organisations, staffed and equipped with able practical
women Jacks of all trades, in their midst, put themselves at the call
of national service, but were headed back from all enterprises.It
had been ordained that women could not fight, and therefore they were
of no use in war time.A few persisted in trying to find openings for
service.It is one thing to offer to be
useful without any particular qualification; it is another to have
professional knowledge to give, and the medical women were strong in
the conviction that they had their hard-won science and skill to offer.Those who have read the preceding pages will realise that Dr.Inglis
carried into this offer a perfect knowledge how women doctors were
regarded by the community, and she knew political departments too well
to believe that the War Office would have a more enlightened outlook.In the past she had said in choosing her profession that she liked
‘pioneer work,’ and she was to be the pioneer woman doctor who, with
the aid of Suffrage societies, founded and led the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals to the healing of many races.Inglis to this point, it is easy
to imagine the working of her fertile brain, and her sense of vital
energy, in the opening weeks of the war.What material for instant
action she had at hand, she used.She had helped to form a detachment
of the V.A.D.when the idea of this once despised and now greatly
desired body began to take shape.Before the war men spoke slightingly
of its object, and it was much depreciated.Inglis saw all the
possibilities which lay in the voluntary aid offer.Inglis was in
Edinburgh at the commencement of the war, and the 6th Edinburgh V.A.D.,
of which she was commandant, was at once mobilised.For several weeks
she worked hard at their training.She gave up the principal rooms in
her house for a depot for the outfit of Cargilfield as an auxiliary
hospital.Inglis
put in charge of it, the wider work of her life might never have had
its fulfilment.Inglis from the first advocated that the V.A.D.should be used as probationers in military hospitals, and the orderlies
who served in her units were chiefly drawn from this body.In September she went to London to put her views before the National
Union and the War Office, and to offer the services of herself
and women colleagues.Miss Mair expresses the thoughts which were
dominating her mind.‘To her it seemed wicked that women with power
to wield the surgeon’s knife in the mitigation of suffering and with
knowledge to diagnose and cure, should be withheld from serving the
sick and wounded.’

Her love for the wounded and suffering gave her a clear vision as
to what lay before the armies of the Allies.‘At the root of all her
strenuous work of the last three years,’ says her sister, ‘was the
impelling force of her sympathy with the wounded men.This feeling
amounted at times to almost agony.Only once did she allow herself to
show this innermost feeling.This was at the root of her passionate
yearning to get with her unit to Mesopotamia during the early months
of 1916.“I cannot bear to think of them, _our Boys_.” To the woman’s
heart within her the wounded men of all nations made the same
irresistible appeal.’

In that spirit she approached a departmental chief.Official reserve at
last gave way, and the historic sentence was uttered--‘My good lady, go
home and sit still.’ In that utterance lay the germ of that inspiration
which was to carry the Red Cross and the Scottish women among many
nations, kindreds, and tongues.The overworked red-tape-bound
official: the little figure of the woman with the smile, and the ready
answer, before him.There is a story that, while a town in Serbia was
under bombardment, Dr.Inglis was also in it with some of her hospital
work.She sought an official in his quarters, as she desired certain
things for her hospital.The noise of the firing was loud, and shells
were flying around.Inglis seemed oblivious of any sound save her
own voice, and she requested of an under officer an interview with his
chief.The official had at last to confess that his superior was hiding
in the cellar till the calamity of shell-fire was overpast.In much
the same condition was the local War Office official when confronted
with Dr.No doubt she saw it was
useless to continue her offers of service.Fawcett says:

 ‘Nearly all the memorial notices of her have recorded the fact that at
 the beginning of her work in 1914 the War Office refused her official
 recognition.The recognition so stupidly refused by her own country
 was joyfully and gratefully given by the French and later the Serbian
 A.M.S.and Red Cross.’

She went home to her family, who so often had inspired her to good
work, and as she sat and talked over the war and her plans with one of
her nieces, she suddenly said, ‘I know what we will do!We will have a
unit of our own.’

The ‘We’ referred to that close-knit body of women with whom she had
worked for a common cause, and she knew at once that ‘We’ would work
with her and in her for the accomplishment of this ideal which so
rapidly took shape in her teeming brain.She was never left alone in any part of her life’s work.Her
personality knit not only her family to her in the closest bonds of
love, but she had devoted friends among those who did not see eye
to eye with her in the common cause.She never loved them the less
for disagreeing with her, and though their indifference to her views
might at times obscure her belief in their mental calibre, it never
interfered with the mutual affections of all.She did not leave these
friends out of her scheme when it began to take shape.The Edinburgh Suffrage offices, no longer needed for propaganda and
organisation work, became the headquarters of the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, and the enlarged committee, chiefly of Dr.Inglis’ personal
friends, began its work under the steam-hammer of her energy.‘Well do I recall the first suggestion that passed between us on the
 subject of directing the energies of our Suffrage Societies to the
 starting of a hospital.Let us gather a few hundred pounds, and then
 appeal to the public, was the decision of our ever courageous Dr.Elsie, and from that moment she never swerved in her purpose.Some of
 us gasped when she announced that the sum of £50,000 must speedily
 be advertised for.Some timid souls advised the naming of a smaller
 amount as our goal.With unerring perception, our leader refused to
 lower the standard, and abundantly has she been proved right!Not
 £50,000, but over £200,000 have rewarded her faith and her hope.‘This quick perception was one of the greatest of her gifts, and it
 was with perfect simplicity she stated to me once that when on rare
 occasions she had yielded her own conviction to pressure from others,
 the result had been unfortunate.There was not an ounce of vanity in
 her composition.She saw the object aimed at, and she marched
 straight on.If, on the road, some obstacles had to be not exactly
 ruthlessly, but very firmly brushed aside, her strength of purpose
 was in the end a blessing to all concerned.Strength combined with
 sweetness--with a wholesome dash of humour thrown in--in my mind sums
 up her character.What that strength did for agonised Serbia only the
 grateful Serbs can fully tell.’

A letter written in October of this year to Mrs.Fawcett tells of the
rapid formation of the hospital idea.‘8 WALKER STREET,
      ‘_Oct.FAWCETT,--I wrote to you from the office this morning,
 but I want to point out a little more fully what the Committee felt
 about the name of the hospitals.We felt that our original scheme
 was growing very quickly into something very big--much bigger than
 anything we had thought of at the beginning--and we felt that if the
 hospitals were called by a non-committal name it would be much easier
 to get all men and women to help.The scheme is _of course_ a National
 Union scheme, and that fact the Scottish Federation will never lose
 sight of, or attempt to disguise.The National Union will be at the
 head of all our appeals, and press notices, and paper.‘But--if you could reverse the position, and imagine for a moment
 that the Anti-Suffrage Society had thought of organising all these
 skilled women for service, you can quite see that many more neutrals,
 and a great many suffragists would have been ready to help if they
 sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign
 Service,” than if they had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League
 Hospital.‘We were convinced that the more women we could get to help, the
 greater would be the gain to the woman’s movement.‘For we have hit upon a really splendid scheme.Laurie and
 I went to see Sir George Beatson--the head of the Scottish Red Cross,
 in Glasgow--he said at once: “Our War Office will have nothing to say
 to you,” and then he added, “yet there is no knowing what they may do
 before the end of the war.”

 ‘You see, we get these expert women doctors, nurses, and ambulance
 workers organised.Once
 these units are out, the work is bound to grow.The need is there,
 and too terrible to allow any haggling about who does the work.If
 we have a thoroughly good organisation here, we can send out more
 and more units, or strengthen those already out.We can add motor
 ambulances, organise rest stations on the lines of communication, and
 so on.It will all depend on how well we are supplied with funds and
 brains at our base.Each unit ought to be carefully chosen, and the
 very best women doctors must go out with them.I wrote this morning to
 the Registered Medical Women’s Association in London, and asked them
 to help us, and offered to address a meeting when I come up for your
 meeting.Next week a special meeting of the Scottish Medical Women’s
 Association is being called to discuss the question.‘From the very beginning we must make it clear that our hospitals are
 as well-equipped and well-manned as any in the field, more economical
 (easy!‘I cannot think of anything more calculated to bring home to men the
 fact that women _can help_ intelligently in any kind of work.So much
 of our work is done where they cannot see it.They’ll see every bit of
 this.‘The fates seem to be fighting for us!Sometimes schemes do float off
 with the most extraordinary ease.The Belgian Consul here is Professor
 Sarolea--the editor of _Everyman_.He grasped at the help we offered,
 and has written off to several influential people.And then yesterday
 morning he wrote saying that his brother Dr.Leon Sarolea, would come
 and “work under” us.He is an M.P., a man of considerable influence.So you can see the Belgian Hospital will have everything in its favour.Seton Watson, who has devoted his life to the Balkan States,
 has taken up the Servian Unit.He puts himself “entirely at our
 service.” He knows all the powers that be in Servia.‘Two people in the Press have offered to help.It must not be wasted, but we must have
 lots.‘And as the work grows do let’s keep it _together_, so that, however
 many hospitals we send out, they all shall be run on the same lines,
 and wherever people see the Union Jack with the red, white and green
 flag below it, they’ll know it means efficiency and kindness and
 intelligence.‘I wanted the Executive, for this reason, to call the hospitals
 “British Women’s Hospitals for Foreign Service,” but of course it was
 their own idea, and one understood the desire to call it “Scottish”;
 but if there is a splendid response from England and from other
 federations, that will have to be reconsidered, _I_ think.The great
 thing is to do the thing well, and do it as _one_ scheme.‘I do hope you’ll approve of all this.I am marking this letter
 “Private,” because it isn’t an official letter, but just what I
 think--to you, my Chief.But you can show it to anybody you like--as
 that.‘I can think of nothing except these “Units” just now!And when one
 hears of the awful need, one can hardly sit still till they are ready.Professor Sarolea simply made one’s heart bleed.He said, “You talk of distress from the war here.You simply
 know nothing about it.”--Ever yours sincerely,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted by the Scottish
Federation, and the name of Scottish Women’s Hospitals was chosen.At the same meeting the committee decided to send Dr.Inglis to London
to explain the plan to the National Union, and to speak at a meeting
in the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to help in the war.’ At
that meeting she was authorised to speak on the plans of the S.W.H.The N.U.W.S.S.adopted the plan of campaign on 15th October, and the
London society was soon taking up the work of procuring money to start
new units, and to send Dr.Inglis out on her last enterprise, with a
unit fully equipped to work with the Serbian army, then fighting on the
Bulgarian front.The use she made of individuals is well illustrated by Miss Burke.She
was ‘found’ by Dr.Inglis in the office of the London Society, and sent
forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.It is written
in the records of that work how wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her
countrymen in America, and how nobly, through her efforts, they have
aided ‘the great adventure.’

      ‘U.S.M.S.Paul_,
      ‘_Saturday, February 9th_.‘DEAR LADY FRANCES,--Certainly I am one of Dr.It
 was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that
 my feet were placed in the path which led to my reaching my maximum
 efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals.Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the
 London Committee for about a month.There was no question of meeting a
 “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled straight into mine.Well, the best way to encourage me was to
 give me responsibility.‘“Do you speak French?”

 ‘“Yes.”

 ‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General de Torcy, telling him
 we accept the building he has offered at Troyes.”

 ‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter should be passed on.‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr.Elsie, “I know the type.If she says she speaks French, she does.”

 ‘She practically signed the letter I wrote her without reading it.Doubtless all the time I was with her I was under her keen scrutiny,
 and when finally, after arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which
 she found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision to leave
 for Serbia, she had already judged me, and without hesitation she told
 me to go to Oxford and speak myself.I have wondered often whether any
 one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker--it needed Dr.Elsie’s knowledge of human character and rapid energetic method of
 making decisions.‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals to analyse our feelings towards Dr.A wave of her
 hand in passing meant much to us.’

Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals as they went forth one by one to France, to Belgium,
to Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia.That history will have some day to
be written.It is only possible in this memoir to speak of their work
in relation to their founder and leader.‘Not I, but my unit,’ was
her dying watchword, and when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is
obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme, the inspiration of
unselfish devotion set them by Dr.Besides going into all the detailed work of the hospital equipment, Dr.Inglis found time to continue her work of speaking for the cause of the
hospitals.We find her addressing her old friends:

 ‘I have the happiest recollection of Dr.I. addressing a small meeting
 of the W. L. Association here.It was one of her first meetings to
 raise money.She told us how she wanted to go to Serbia.She was so
 convincing, but with all my faith in her, I never thought she _would_
 get there!That, and much more she did--a lesson in faith.‘She looked round the little gathering in the Good Templar Hall and
 said, “I suppose nobody here could lend me a yacht?” She did get her
 ship there.’

To one of her workers in this time, she said, ‘My dear, we shall live
all our lives in the shadow of war.’ The one to whom she spoke says, ‘A
cold chill struck my heart.Did she feel it, and know that never again
would things be as they were?’

At the close of 1914 Dr.Inglis went to France to see the Scottish
Women’s Hospital established and working under the French Red Cross at
Royaumont.It was probably on her way back that she went to Paris on
business connected with Royaumont.She went into Notre Dame, and chose
a seat in a part of the cathedral where she could feel alone.She there
had an experience which she afterwards told to Mrs.As she
sat there she had a strong feeling that some one was behind her.She
resisted the impulse to turn round, thinking it was some one who like
herself wanted to be quiet!The feeling grew so strong at last, that
she involuntarily turned round.There was no one near her, but for the
first time she realised she was sitting in front of a statue of Joan of
Arc.To her it appeared as if the statue was instinct with life.She
added: ‘Wasn’t it curious?’ Then later she said, ‘I would like to know
what Joan was wanting to say to me!’ I often think of the natural way
which she told me of the experience, and the _practical_ conclusion
of wishing to know what Joan wanted.Once again she referred to the
incident, before going to Russia.I see her expression now, just for a
moment forgetting everything else, keen, concentrated, and her humorous
smile, as she said, ‘You know I would like awfully to know what Joan
was trying to say to me.’

Elsie Inglis was not the first, nor will she be the last woman who has
found help in the story of the Maid of Orleans, when the causes dear to
the hearts of nations are at stake.It is easy to hear the words that
would pass between these two leaders in the time of their country’s
warfare.The graven figure of Joan was instinct with life, from the
undying love of race and country, which flowed back to her from the
woman who was as ready to dedicate to her country her self-forgetting
devotion, as Jeanne d’Arc had been in her day.Both, in their day and
generation, had heard--

    ‘The quick alarming drum--
    Saying, Come,
    Freemen, come,
    Ere your heritage be wasted, said the quick alarming drum.’

      ‘ABBAYE DE ROYAUMONT,
      ‘_Dec.‘DEAREST AMY,--Many, many happy Christmases to you, dear, and to
 all the others.Everything is splendid here now, and if the General
 from headquarters would only come and inspect us, we could begin.I only wish you could see them with their
 red bedcovers, and little tables.There are four wards, and we have
 called them Blanche of Castille (the woman who really started the
 building of this place, the mother of Louis IX., the Founder, as he
 is called), Queen Margaret of Scotland, Joan of Arc, and Millicent
 Fawcett.Now, don’t you think that is rather nice!The Abbaye itself
 is a wonderful place.It has beautiful architecture, and is placed in
 delightful woods.One wants to spend hours exploring it, instead of
 which we have all been working like galley slaves getting the hospital
 in order.There are
 no thermometers and no sandbags.Yesterday,
 I was told there were no tooth-brushes and no nail-brushes, but they
 appeared.After all the fuss, you can imagine our feelings when the
 “Director,” an official of the French Red Cross, who has to live here
 with us, told us French soldiers don’t want tooth-brushes!‘Our first visitors were three French officers, whom we took for the
 inspecting general, and treated with grovelling deference, till we
 found they knew nothing about it, and were much more interested in the
 tapestry in the proprietor’s house than in our instruments.However,
 they were very nice, and said we were _bien meublé_.‘Once we had all been on tenterhooks all day about the inspection.Suddenly, a man poked his head round the door of the doctor’s
 sitting-room and said, “The General.” In one flash every doctor was
 out of the room and into her bedroom for her uniform coat, and I was
 left sitting.I got up, and wandered downstairs, when an excited
 orderly dashed past, singing, “Nothing but two British officers!”
 Another time we were routed out from breakfast by the cry of “The
 General,” but this time it turned out to be a French regiment, whose
 officers had been moved by curiosity to come round by here.‘We have had to get a new boiler in the kitchen, new taps and
 lavatories, and electric light, an absolute necessity in this huge
 place, and all the theatre sinks.We certainly are no longer a
 _mobile_ hospital, but as we are twelve miles from the point from
 which the wounded are distributed (I am getting very discreet about
 names since a telegram of mine was censored), we shall probably be as
 useful here as anywhere.They even think we may get English Tommies.‘You have no idea of the conditions to which the units came out, and
 they have behaved like perfect bricks.The place was like an ice hole:
 there were no fires, no hot water, no furniture, not even blankets,
 and the equipment did not arrive for five days.They have scrubbed the
 whole place out themselves, as if they were born housemaids; put up
 the beds, stuffed the mattresses, and done everything.They stick at absolutely nothing, and when Madame came,
 she said, “What it is to belong to a practical nation!”

 ‘We had a service in the ward on Sunday.We are going to see if they
 will let us use the little St.There are two other
 chapels, one in use, that we hope the soldiers will go to, and a
 beautiful chapel the same style of architecture as the chapel at Mont
 St.It is a perfect joy to walk through it to meals.The
 village curé has been to tea with us.‘Will you believe it, that General hasn’t arrived _yet_!--Your loving

      ELSIE.’

Mr.Seton Watson has permitted his article in the December number of
the _New Europe_ (1917) to be reprinted here.His complete knowledge
of Serbia enables him to describe both the work and Dr.Inglis who
undertook the great task set before her.‘Elsie Inglis was one of the heroic figures of the war, one whose
 memory her many friends will cherish with pride and confidence--pride
 at having been privileged to work with her, confidence in the race
 which breeds such women.This is not the place to tell the full story
 of her devotion to many a good cause at home, but the _New Europe_
 owes her a debt of special interest and affection.For in her own
 person she stood for that spirit of sympathy and comprehension upon
 which intercourse between the nations must be founded, if the ideal of
 a New Europe is ever to become a reality.‘Though her lifework had hitherto lain in utterly different fields,
 she saw in a flash the needs of a tragic situation; and when war came
 offered all her indomitable spirit and tireless energy to a cause
 till recently unknown and even frowned upon in our country.Like
 the Douglas of old, she flung herself where the battle raged most
 fiercely--always claiming and at last obtaining permission to set up
 her hospitals where the obstacles were greatest and the dangers most
 acute.But absorbed as she was in her noble task of healing, she saw
 beyond it the high national ideal that inspired the Serbs to endure
 sufferings unexampled even in this war, and became an enthusiastic
 convert to the cause of Southern Slav unity.To her, as to all true
 Europeans, the principle of nationality is not, indeed, the end of
 all human wisdom, but the sure foundation upon which a new and saner
 internationalism is to be built, and an inalienable right to which
 great and small alike are entitled.Perhaps the fact that she herself
 came of a small nation which, like Serbia, has known how to celebrate
 its defeats, was not without its share in determining her sympathies.‘The full political meaning of her work has not yet been brought home
 to her countrymen, and yet what she has done will live after her.Her
 achievement in Serbia itself in 1915 was sufficiently remarkable, but
 even that was a mere prelude to her achievement on the Eastern front.The Serbian Division in Southern Russia, which the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals went out to help, was not Serbian at all in the _ordinary_
 sense of the word.Its proper name is the Jugoslav Division, for
 it was composed entirely of volunteers drawn from among the Serbs,
 Croats, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary who had been taken prisoners
 by the Russian army.Thousands of these men enrolled themselves on the
 side of the Entente and in the service of Serbia, in order to fight
 for the realisation of Southern Slav independence and unity under the
 national dynasty of Kara George.Beyond the ordinary risks of war
 they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy would mean the
 same fate as Austria meted out to the heroic Italian deputy, Cesare
 Battisti; and some of them, left wounded on the battle-field after
 a retreat, shot each other to avoid being taken alive.Throughout
 the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most desperate gallantry
 against impossible odds, and, owing to inadequate support during the
 retreat, their main body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000.Latterly the
 other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at Odessa, after sharing
 the defence of the Rumanian southern front.‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent a certain number
 of higher officers, but, for equipment and medical help, they were
 dependent upon what the Russians could spare from their own almost
 unlimited needs.Inglis and her unit came to the
 help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and misfortunes, and
 spared no effort in their cause.‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that of Lady
 Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of women who have redeemed for
 all time the honour of Britain in the Balkans.Among the Serbs it is
 already assuming an almost legendary quality.To us it will serve to
 remind us that Florence Nightingale will never be without successors
 among us.And in particular, every true Scotsman will cherish her
 memory, every believer in the cause for which she gave her life will
 gain fresh courage from her example.R. W. SETON-WATSON.CHAPTER IX

SERBIA

    ‘Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
    waters, from the hand of strange children.’

    ‘And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.For in those
    days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the
    creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.’

    ‘On either side of the river, was there the tree of life: And the
    leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.’


Dr.Inglis remained at home directing the many operations necessary
to ensure the proper equipment of the units, and the difficult task of
getting them conveyed overseas.From the beginning, till her return
with her unit serving with the Serbian army in Russia, she had the
sustaining co-operation both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.In the many complications surrounding the history of the hospitals
with the Allied armies, the Scottish women owed very much to both
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord
Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office.It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals staffed entirely by
women, serving abroad with armies fighting the common and unscrupulous
foe, accepted by those in authority.The Foreign Office was responsible
for the safety of these British outpost hospitals, and they knew well
the dangers and privations to which the devoted pioneer band of women
would be exposed.Inglis, which
she accepted, and abided by as long as her work was not hindered.No
care or diplomatic work was spared, and if at the end of their service
in Russia the safety of the unit was a matter of grave anxiety to
the Foreign Office, it had never cause to be ashamed of the way this
country’s honour and good faith was upheld by the hospitals under the
British flag, amid the chaotic sufferings of the Russian people.Eleanor Soltau, who was in charge of the
First Serbian Unit, became ill with diphtheria in the midst of the
typhus epidemic which was devastating the Serbian people.The Serbian
Minister writes of that time:--

 ‘They were the first to go to the help of Serbia when the Austrians,
 after they were defeated, besides 60,000 prisoners, also left behind
 them epidemics in all the districts which they had invaded.The
 Scottish women turned up their sleeves, so to speak, at the railways
 station itself, and went straight to typhus and typhoid-stricken
 patients, who were pitifully dying in the crowded hospitals.’

Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., wrote after her death: ‘It was my privilege
and happiness to see much of her work in Serbia when I was officer in
charge of the corps of R.A.M.C.officers sent out by the W.O.to deal
with the raging epidemic of typhus and famine fevers then devastating
the land.I have never met with any one who gave me so deep an
impression of singlemindedness, gentleheartedness, clear and purposeful
vision, wise judgment, and absolutely fearless disposition.... No more
lovable personality than hers, or more devoted and courageous body of
women, ever set out to help effectively a people in dire distress than
the S.W.H.,’ which she organised and sent out, and afterwards took
personal charge of in Serbia in 1915.Amidst the most trying conditions
she, or they, never faltered in courage or endurance.Under her wise
and gentle leadership difficulties seemed only to stir to further
endeavour, more extended work, and greater endurance of hardship.Captain Ralph Glyn writes from France:--

 ‘I see you went to the funeral of that wonderful person, Dr.I shall never forget arriving where that S.W.unit was in the
 midst of the typhus in Serbia, and finding her and all her people so
 “clean” and obviously ready for anything.’

The Serbian nation lost no time in commemorating her services to them.At Mladenovatz they built a beautiful fountain close to the camp
hospital.On 7th October 1915 it was formally opened with a religious
service according to the rites of the Greek Church.Inglis turned
on the water, which was to flow through the coming years in grateful
memory of the good work done by the Scottish Women’s Hospitals.ELSIE INGLIS

 (Obiit Nov.At Mladenovatz still the fountain sings
      Raised by the Serbs to you their angel friend,
      Who fought the hunger-typhus to its end;
    A nobler fountain from your memory springs,
    A fountain-head where Faith renews its wings
      --Faith in the powers of womanhood to bend
      War’s curse to blessing, and to make amend
    By Love, for Hate’s unutterable things.Wherefore, when cannon-voices cease to roar,
      A louder voice shall echo in our ears
        --Voice of three peoples joined in one accord,
    Telling that, gentle to your brave heart’s core,
      You faced unwavering all that woman fears,
        And clear of vision followed Christ the Lord.[NOTE.--Two years ago the Serbians dedicated a simple fountain in
 ‘Mladenovatz’ to the grateful memory of one they spoke of as ‘the
 angel of their people.’ The Rumanian and Russian refugees in the
 Dobrudja will never forget her.]_The Englishwoman_, April and June 1916, has two articles written by
Dr.Inglis, under the title ‘The Tragedy of Serbia.’ The literary power
of her narrative makes one regret that she did not live to give a
consecutive account of all she passed through in the countries in which
she suffered with the peoples:--

 ‘When we reached Serbia in May 1915, she was lying in sunshine.Two
 storms had raged over her during the preceding months--the Austrian
 invasion and the terrific typhus epidemic.In our safe little island
 we can hardly realise what either meant.At the end of 1914, the
 Austrian Empire hurled its “punitive expedition” across the Danube--a
 punitive expedition that ended in the condign punishment of the
 invader.They left behind them a worse foe than themselves, and the
 typhus, which began in the hospitals they left so scandalously filthy
 and overcrowded, swept over the land.’

Dr.Inglis describes ‘the long peaceful summer,’ with its hopes of
an advance to their aid on the part of the Allies.The Serbs were
conscious the ‘Great Powers’ owed them much, for how often we heard the
words, ‘We are the only one, as yet, who has beaten our enemy.’

‘Not till September did any real sense of danger trouble them.Then the
clouds rolled up black and threatening on the horizon--Bulgaria arming,
and a hundred thousand Germans massing on the northern frontier.They
began to draw off the main part of their army from the Danube towards
the east, to meet their old enemies.The Powers refused to let them
attack, and they waited till the Bulgarian mobilisation was complete.The Allies discounted the attack from the north; aeroplanes had been
out, and “there are no Germans there.” There are no signs whatever of
any military movements, so said the wiseacres.The only troops there
are untrained Austrian levies, which the Serbs ought to be able to deal
with themselves, if they are up to their form last year.The 100,000 Germans appeared on the northern
frontier.The Bulgars invaded from the east, the Greeks did not come
in, and the Austrians poured in from the west.The Serbian army
shortened the enormous line they had to defend, but they could not
stand against the long-distance German guns, and so began the retreat.‘“What is coming to Serbia?” said a Serb to me, “we cannot think.”
And then, hopefully, “But God is great and powerful, and our Allies
are great and powerful too.” Strong men could hardly speak of the
disaster without breaking down.“When
are your men coming up?They must come soon.” “We must give our people
two months,” the experts among us answered, “to bring up the heavy
artillery.We thought the Serbs would be able to hold the West Morava
Valley.” “It is too hilly for the German artillery to be of any use,”
they said.’

Dr.Inglis goes on to relate how all the calculations were wrong, how
the Austrian force came down that very valley.The Serbs were caught
in a trap, and that 160,000 of their gallant little army escaped was
a wonderful feat.‘That they are already keen to take the field again
is but one more proof of the extraordinary recuperative power of the
nation.’

Dr.Elsie gives an account of the typhus epidemic.Soltau, in 1914, was able at Kragujevatz to do excellent
work for the Serbian army after its victories, and it was only
evacuated owing to the retreat in October 1915.The unit had only
been a fortnight out when the committee got from it a telegram, ‘dire
necessity’ for more doctors and nurses.The word _dire_ was used,
hoping it would pass unnoticed by the censor, for the authorities did
not wish the state of Serbia from typhus to be generally known.We
shall never know what the death-rate was during the epidemic; but of
the 425 Serbian doctors, 125 died of the disease, and two-thirds of the
remainder had it.The Scottish Committee hastened out supplies and staff.‘For three months the epidemic raged, and all women may ever be proud
 of the way those women worked.It was like a long-drawn-out battle,
 and not one of them played the coward.Not one of them asked to come
 away.There were three deaths and nine cases of illness among the
 unit; and may we not truly claim that those three women who died gave
 their lives for the great cause for which our country stands to-day as
 much as any man in the trenches.’

Dr.Inglis speaks of the full share of work taken by other British
units--Lady Paget’s Hospital at Skopio, ‘magnificently organised’; The
Red Cross under Dr.Banks ‘took more than its share of the burden’; and
how Dr.Ryan of the American hospital asserted that Serbia would have
been wiped out but for the work of the Foreign Missions.Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with her leader:--

      ‘KRAGUJEVATZ.Elsie Inglis took me out shopping with her, and we
 wanted a great many things for our hospital in the way of drugs, etc.,
 and we also wanted more than anything else some medical scales for
 weighing drugs.Inglis saw hanging up
 in it three pairs of these scales.So she asked the man, in her most
 persuasive manner, if he would sell her a pair of these scales for our
 hospital use.He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
 was sorry that he could not possibly sell them.Inglis bought
 some more things--in fact, we stayed in the shop for about an hour
 buying things to the amount of £10, and between each of the different
 articles purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
 “You know it is for _your_ men that we want them,” until at last the
 man--exhausted by his refusals--took down the scales and presented
 them to her.When she asked “How much are they?” he made a bow, and
 said it would be a pleasure to give them to her.‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for some time, and
 before we were liberated, the German Command came bringing a paper
 which they commanded Dr.The purport of the paper was
 a statement which declared that the British prisoners had been well
 treated in the hands of the Germans, and was already signed by two men
 who were heads of other British units.Inglis said, “Why should
 I sign this paper?I do not know if all the prisoners are being well
 treated by you, therefore I decline to sign it.” To which the German
 authorities replied, “You must sign it.” Dr.Inglis then said, “Well,
 make me,” and that was the end of that incident--she never did sign it.‘So convinced were some of the people belonging to the Scottish
 Women’s unit that the British forces were coming to the aid of their
 Serbian ally, that long after they were taken prisoners they thought,
 each time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that their
 liberators were close at hand.So much so indeed, that three of the
 members of the unit begged that in the event of the unit being sent
 home they might be allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs,
 to help the Serbian Red Cross.Inglis _unofficially_ consented to
 this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross these three people in
 question adjourned to a village hard by which was about a mile from
 the hospital, three days before the unit had orders to move.Inglis and three other people of the unit knew where these
 three members were living.However, the date of the departure was
 changed, and the unit was told they were to wait another twenty days.This made it impossible for these three people to appear again with
 the unit.They continued to live at the little house which sheltered
 them.Suddenly one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
 ask at the German Command if there were any letters for the unit.At
 this interview, which took place about three o’clock in the afternoon,
 the person was informed that the whole unit was to leave that night
 at 7.30.Inglis sent the person who received this command to tell
 the three people in the cottage to get ready, and that they must go,
 she thought.But the messenger only said, “We have had orders that the
 unit is to go at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr.Inglis had
 sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they did nothing
 but simply went to bed at ten o’clock, thinking the unit had already
 started.It was a wintry night, snowing heavily, and not a night that
 one would have sent out a dog!‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window, and Dr.Inglis’
 voice was heard saying, “You have to come at once to the train.I
 am here with an armed guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at
 the station for some hours, but the train was not allowed to start
 until every one was there.)It was
 difficult to get her to enter the house, and naturally she seemed
 rather ruffled, having had to come more than a mile in the deep snow,
 as she was the only person who knew anything about us.One of the
 party said, “Are you really cross, or are you pretending because the
 armed guard understands English?” She gave her queer little smile, and
 said, “No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped through the
 snow to the station, and on the way she told them she was afraid that
 she had smashed somebody’s window, having knocked at another cottage
 before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the one we lived
 in, for which she was very much chaffed by her companions, who knew
 well her views on the question of militant tactics!‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes with no
 accommodation whatsoever.Occasionally the train drew up in the middle
 of the country, and anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask
 the sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out for a moment.‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the station at
 Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their charges all lying on the
 floor together; the only person who seemed to be awake was the officer
 who guarded the door himself all night.In the morning one was not
 allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a sentry to come and
 stand at the door.The next two days were spent in an ordinary train
 rather too well heated with four a side in second-class compartments.At Vienna all the British units who were being sent away were formed
 into a group on the station at 6 A.M., where they awaited the arrival
 of the American Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who
 gave his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
 station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they had to leave
 that town.Inglis with a party adjourned to a
 hotel where baths, etc., were provided.Other members were allowed to
 do what they liked.‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz, close to the
 frontier, for Switzerland.On their arrival at Zürich they were met
 by the British Consul-General, Vice-Consul, and many members of the
 British Colony, who gave Dr.Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
 welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all they could to
 show them kindness and pleasure at their safe arrival.‘It is difficult for people who have never been prisoners to know what
 the first day’s freedom means.Everybody had a different expression,
 and seemed to have a different outlook on life.But already we could
 see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with schemes for the
 future work of the unit.‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech in which he told the
 unit all that had passed during the last four months, of which they
 knew nothing.’

_To her Sister._

      ‘BRINDISI, _en route_ for SERBIA,
      ‘_April 28, 1915_.‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did not even come in
 till this morning.However, we have only lost twenty-four hours.‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the bit from Naples
 here, and that was rather awful, with spitting men and shut windows,
 in first-class carriages, remember.When we got here we immediately
 ordered baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well, then,
 we must go somewhere else”--with the result that we were promised
 baths in our rooms at once.That was a nice bath, and then I curled
 up on the sofa and went to sleep.Our windows look right on to the
 docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond.It is so queer to see the
 red, white, and green flags, and to think they mean Italy, and not the
 N.U.W.S.S.!‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled through the quaint
 streets.The whole population was out, and most whole-hearted and
 openly interested in my uniform.‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships and the colours.There are three men-of-war in, and half a dozen of the quaintest
 little boats, which a soldier told me were “scouts.” I wished I had
 asked a sailor, for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I asked
 is one of the bersaglieri with cock’s feathers, a huge mass of them,
 in his hat.They all say Italy is certainly coming into the war.One
 man on the train to Rome was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the
 Italian Government.He told us weird stories about German tricks to
 get our coal through Spain and other countries.‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont.It is a _huge_ success, and I do
 think Dr.The wards and the theatre,
 and the X-Ray department, and the rooms for mending and cleaning the
 men’s clothes were all perfect.’

_To Mrs.Simson._

      ‘S.W.H., KRAGUJEVATZ,
      _May 30/15_.‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the Serbians are
 delightful.I am staying with a charming woman, Madame Milanovitz.She
 is a Vice-President of the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the
 country in time of war.I think she wanted to help us because of all
 the hospital has done here.Any how, _I_ score--I have a beautiful
 room and everything.She gives me an early cup of coffee, and for the
 rest I live with the unit.Neither she nor I can speak six words of
 one another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little French.Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady who teaches the unit
 Serbian, to live with her to interpret.‘We have had a busy time since we arrived.The unit is nursing 550
 beds, in three hospitals, having been sent out to nurse 300 beds.There is first the surgical hospital, called Reserve No.It was a
 school, and is in two blocks with a long courtyard between.I think
 we have got it really quite well equipped, with a fine X-Ray room.The theatre, and the room opposite where the dressings are done, both
 very well arranged, and a great credit to Sister Bozket.The one thing
 that troubled me was the floor--old wood and holes in it, impossible
 to sterilise--but yesterday, Major Protitch, our Director, said he was
 going to get cement laid down in it and the theatre.Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
 in Serbia.” You must not believe that _quite_, for they are very good
 at saying pleasant things here!‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one, No.6 Reserve, and
 one for relapsing fever and general diseases, No.We have put most of our strength in No.6, and it is in
 good working order, but No.7 has had only one doctor, and two day
 Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds.Still it is wonderful what
 those three women have done.We have Austrian prisoners as orderlies
 everywhere, in the hospitals and in the houses.The conglomeration of
 languages is too funny for words--Serbian, German, French, English.Sometimes, you have to get an orderly to translate Serbian into
 German, and another to translate the German into French before you can
 get at what is wanted.Two words we have all learnt, _dotra_, which
 means “good,” and which these grateful people use at once if they
 feel a little better, or are pleased about anything, and the other is
 _boli_, pain--poor men!‘So much for what we _have_ been doing; but the day before
 yesterday we got our orders for a new bit of work.They are forming a
 disinfecting centre at Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the
 head of the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at once,
 with our whole fever staff, under canvas.They are giving us the tents
 till ours come out.Typhus is decreasing so much, that No.6 is to be
 turned into a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious
 diseases hospital here.I am so pleased at being asked to do this,
 for it is part of a big and well thought out scheme.Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also
 for infectious diseases.I hope she is at Salonika to-day.We really began to think the Governor was going to
 keep her altogether!Her equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent
 Mrs.Smith up to Posheravatz to choose the site and
 pitch the tent.‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in Colonel G.’s office
 yesterday, and that was that five motor cars were in Serbia, north of
 Mladanovatz, for _me_.Of course, I had wired for six, but you have
 been prompt about them.How they got into the north of Serbia I cannot
 imagine, unless they were dropped out of aeroplanes.‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done in the most awful
 stress all through March and April.We ought to be awfully proud of
 them.Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
 Hunter had two medals._To her Niece, Amy M‘Laren._

      ‘VALJEVO, _August 16, 1915_.‘DARLING AMY,--I wonder if you could find this place on the map.I have spelt it properly, but if you want to say it you must say
 _Valuvo_.One of the hospitals mother has been collecting so much
 money for is here.It is in tents,
 on a bit of sloping ground looking south.There are big tents for
 the patients, and little tents for the staff.I pull my bed out
 of the tent every night, and sleep outside under the stars.Such
 lovely starlight nights we have here.Alice Hutchison is head of
 this unit, and I am here on a visit to her.My own hospital is in
 a town--Kragujevatz.Now, I wonder if you can find that place?The
 hospital there is in a girls’ school.Now--I wonder what will happen
 to the lessons of all those little girls as long as the war lasts?Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in three years, and
 the women of the country have kept the agriculture of the country
 going all that time.A Serbian officer told me the other day that
 the country is so grateful to them, that they are going to strike a
 special medal for the women to show their thanks, when this war is
 over.This is such a beautiful country, and such nice people.Some day
 when the war is over, we’ll come here, and have a holiday.How are you
 getting on, my precious?God bless you,
 dear little girlie.--Ever your loving Aunt

      ELSIE.’

As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.Serbia was overrun by
the Austro-German forces, and she, with others of her units, was taken
prisoner, as they had decided it was their duty to remain at their work
among the sick and wounded.Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:--

 ‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the Scottish women reorganised
 themselves as tent hospitals and offered to go as near as possible
 to the army at the front.Their camp in the town of Valjevo--which
 suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion--might have stood
 in the middle of England.In Lazarevatz, shortly before the new
 Austro-German offensive, they formed a surgical hospital almost out
 of nothing, in the devastated shops and the village inns, and they
 accomplished the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured in from
 the battle-field.When it became obvious that the Serbian army could
 not resist the combined Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians,
 who were about four times their numbers, the main care of the Serbian
 military authorities was what to do with the hospitals full of
 wounded, and whom to leave with the wounded soldiers, who refused to
 be left to fall into the hands of the cruel enemy.Then the Scottish
 women declared that they were not going to leave their patients, and
 that they would stay with them, whatever the conditions, and whatever
 might be expected from the enemy.They remained with the Serbian
 wounded as long as they could be of use to them.Simson._

      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just feels exactly
 like having the rain pouring down, and the wind beating in gusts, and
 not being able to see for the water in one’s eyes, and just holding on
 and saying, “It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
 you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they are.Remember,
 they have been fighting for years for their independence, and now it
 all seems to end.Germans, Austrians,
 Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava Valley, and
 the country a little south of it.And their big Allies--from here
 it looks as if they are never going to move.I went into Craijuvo
 yesterday, in the car, to see about Dr.The road
 was crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods piled on
 their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the top, and then bands
 of soldiers, stragglers from the army.These men were forming up
 again, as we passed back later on.We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too awful
 leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.Sir Ralph eventually
 agreed, and we gave everybody in the units the choice of going or
 staying.We have about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty
 have gone.Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day, with one or two
 laggards and a wounded English soldier we have had charge of.MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.It is
 the starting-place for Montenegro.We all managed wonderfully in our
 first “evacuations,” and saved practically everything, but now it is
 hopeless.The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow on
 sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun looting.There’ll be famine, as well as cold, in this corner of the
 world soon, and then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
 Salonika won’t help much.‘The beloved British troops,--the thought of them always cheers.But
 not the thought of the idiots at the top who had not enough gumption
 to _know_ this must happen.Anybody, even us women, could have told
 them that the Germans must try and break through to the help of the
 Turks.‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and Dr.Holloway
 is helping in the military hospital.I believe there are about 1000
 wounded in the place.I can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy
 dear, because at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
 reach you.I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin passes at this
 time of year!There is a persistent rumour that the French have
 retaken Skopiro, and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will
 be open soon.‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that have been
 happening, and all the funny things too!For there have been funny
 things, in the middle of all the sadness.The guns are booming away,
 and the country looking so lovely in the sunlight.I wonder if Serbia
 is a particularly beautiful country, or whether it looks so lovely
 because of the tragedy of this war, just as bed seems particularly
 delightful when the night bell goes!’

      ‘SERBIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL,
      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We have been here about a month.It was dreadfully sad work leaving
 our beautiful little hospital at Krushieevatz.Here, we are working in
 the Serbian military hospital, and living in it also.You can imagine
 that we have plenty to do, when you hear we have 900 wounded.The
 prisoners are brought in every day, sometimes thousands, and go on to
 the north, leaving the sick.The Director has put the sanitation and
 the laundry into our hands also.‘We have had a hard frost for four days now, and snowstorms.My
 warm things did not arrive--I suppose they are safe at Salonika.Fortunately last year’s uniform was still in existence, and I wear
 three pairs of stockings, with my high boots.We have all cut our
 skirts short, for Serbian mud is awful.It is a lovely land, and the
 views round here are very cheering.One sunset I shall never forget--a
 glorious sky, and the hills deep blue against it.In the foreground
 the camp fires, and the prisoners round them in the fading light.’

With the invasion came the question of evacuation.At one time it was
possible the whole of the British unit might escape _via_ Montenegro.Sir Ralph Paget, realising that the equipment could not be saved,
allowed any of the hospital unit who wished to remain with their
wounded.Two parties went with the retreating Serbs, and their story
and the extraordinary hardships they endured has been told elsewhere.Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr.Inglis’ opinion the fortunate
units.For three months they tended the Serbian wounded under foreign
occupation.Inglis kept to their work, and when
necessary confronted the Austro-German officers with all the audacity
of their leader and the Scottish thistle combined.When we went up
there were 900 patients.During the greatest part of the pressure the
number rose to 1200.Patients were placed in the corridors--at first
one man to one bed, but later two beds together, and three men in them.Then there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were placed on the
floor.The magazine in full blast was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.There were three tiers,
the slightly wounded men in the highest tier.Inglis says the time to see the place at its
best or its worst was in the gloaming, when two or three feeble oil
lamps illuminated the gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the men swarmed up and
down the poles of their shelves chattering as Serbs will chatter.The
Sisters called the place ‘the Zoo.’

The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge, amid such conditions
of overcrowding, underfeeding, fatigue and depression, was great.Inglis details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in sanitation.There was no expert amongst them:--

 ‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a truly terrible
 place--the sights and smells beyond description.We dug the rubbish
 into the ground, emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
 and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned.That is an Englishman’s job all
 over the world.Our three untrained English girl orderlies took to it
 like ducks to water.It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
 world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed and kept going.We
 had not a single case of typhus; we had a greater achievement than
 its prevention.Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners were
 put into the wards, straight from the march, unwashed and crawling
 with lice, there was great indignation among the patients already in.“Doktoritza,” they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us we
 shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced.If we have done nothing
 else, we thought, we have driven that fact home to the Serbian mind
 that dirt and typhus go together.’

Dr.Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian prisoners:--

 ‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of the good work they
 had done for the Allies in driving back the Austrians in their first
 punitive expedition.We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten
 our enemy.They came back to us broken and dispirited.They were
 turned into the hospital grounds, with a scanty ration of beans, with
 a little meat and half a loaf of bread for twenty-four hours.Their
 camp fires flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges over the drains, and
 the trees hacked down for firewood.We added to the rations of our
 sanitary workers, we gave away all the bread we could, but we could
 not feed that enclosure of hungry men.We used to hear them coughing
 and moaning all night.’

Dr.Inglis details the starving condition of the whole country, the
weakness of the famine-stricken men who worked for them, the starved
yoke oxen, and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun by the
enemy.‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working for those
 grateful patient men, and in helping the director, Major Nicolitch, so
 loyal to his country and so conscientious in his work, to bring order
 out of chaos, and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
 physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners lay always like
 a dead weight on our spirit.Never shall we forget the beauty of the
 sunrises, or the glory of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days
 between, and the wonderful starlit nights.But we shall never forget
 “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the windows when we hid our
 heads under the blankets to shut out the sound.The unit got no news,
 and they made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in the
 German telegrams.We could not believe Serbia had been sacrificed for
 nothing.We were convinced it was some deep laid scheme for weakening
 other fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such as that
 the English had taken Belgium, and the French were in Metz.‘The end of the five months of service in captivity, and to captive
 Serbs ended.On the 11th February 1916, they were sent north under an
 Austrian guard with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
 stages they came to Zürich.‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and to realise how strong
 and straight and fearless a people inhabit these islands: to realise
 not so much that they mean to win the war, but rather that they
 consider any other issue impossible.’

So Dr.Inglis came back to plan new campaigns for the help of the
Serbian people, who lay night and day upon her heart.She knew she had
the backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended to get the
ear of the English public for the cause of the Allies in the Balkans.‘We,’ who had sent her out, found her changed in many ways.Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever have thought of the body
in the presence of that dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away.The privations and sufferings she
described so well when she had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been
fully shared by the unit.Their comfort was always her thought; she
never would have anything that could not be shared and shared alike,
but there was little but hardship to share, and one and all scorned to
speak of privations which were a light affliction compared to those
of a whole nation groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.There was a look in her face of one whose spirit had been pierced by
the sword.The brightness of her eyes was dimmed, for she had seen the
days when His judgments were abroad upon the earth:--

    ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
    He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
        stored;
    He has loosed the fatal lightning of His terrible swift sword:
    I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
    They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
    I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.’

She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and she came home, not
to rest, but vowed to yet greater endeavours for their welfare.The
attitude of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.She had
something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell, when he threatened to
send his fleet across the Alps to help the Waldensians.In her public
speeches, when she set forth what in her outlook could have been done,
no censor cut out the sentences which were touched by the live coals
from off her altar of service.Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was well.As to her
political and military outlook, the story of the nations will find it a
place in the history of the war.For a few months she worked from the bases of her two loyal
Committees in London and Edinburgh.She spoke at many a public meeting,
and filled many a drawing-room.The Church of Scotland knew her
presence in London.‘One of our most treasured memories will be that
keen, clever face of hers in St.Columba’s of a Sunday--with the far,
wistful melancholy in it, added to its firm determination.’ So writes
the minister.‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes, a yet
more complete dedication to the service of her Serbian brethren.CHAPTER X

RUSSIA

1917

    ‘Even so in our mortal journey,
      The bitter north winds blow,
    And thus upon life’s red river,
      Our hearts as oarsmen row.And when the Angel of Shadow
      Rests his feet on wave and shore,
    And our eyes grow dim with watching,
      And our hearts faint at the oar,

    Happy is he who heareth
      The signal of his release
    In the bells of the holy city
      The chimes of eternal peace.’


Dr.Inglis’ return to England was the signal for renewed efforts
on the part of the Committees managing the S.W.H.This memoir has
necessarily to follow the personality of the leader, but it must never
be forgotten that her strength and all her sinews of war lay in the
work of those who carried on at home, week by week.Strong committees
of women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took over the burden
of finance--a matter Dr.Inglis once amusingly said, ‘did not interest
her.’ They found and selected the _personnel_ on which success so much
depended, they contracted for and supervised the sending out of immense
consignments of equipment and motor transport.They dealt with the
Government department, and in loyal devotion smoothed every possible
obstacle out of the path of those flying squadrons, the units of the
S.W.H.It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious energy of Dr.Inglis,
far away from the base of her operations, should at times have found
it hard to understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to drag, and
the new effort she desired to make did not move at the pace which to
her eager spirit seemed possible.Two enterprises filled her mind on
her return in 1916.One, by the help of the London Committee, she put
through.This was the celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain.The flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her chairmanship
prepared for in six weeks.Hundreds of lectures on the history of
Serbia were arranged for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they might think the prospect
of making the British people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush of the work Dr.Inglis
was planning the last and most arduous of all the undertakings of the
S.W.H., that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian Volunteers
on the Rumanian Russian front.Inglis knew from private sources the
lack of hospital arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the backing
of the Committees, had approached the authorities for leave to take a
fully equipped unit to Basra.When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the War Office, the
Foreign Office, and S.W.H.will throw a tragic light on this lamentable
episode, and, read with the report of the Committees, it will prove how
quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.Inglis
brought her units back from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to
send her out.Of her treatment by the War Office, Mrs.Fawcett writes:
‘She was not only refused, but refused with contumely and insult.’

True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back, she lost no time
in pressing on her last enterprise for the Serbians.M. Curcin, in _The
Englishwoman_, says:--

 ‘She was already acquainted with one side of the Serbian
 problem--Serbia; she was told that in Russia there was the best
 opportunity to learn about the second half--the Serbs of Austria, the
 Jugoslavs.Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
 unit and transport section staffed by eighty women heroes of the
 Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with her on a most adventurous
 undertaking, _via_ Archangel, through Russia to Odessa and the
 Dobrudja.Inglis succeeded also--most difficult of all--in
 getting permission from the British authorities for the journey.Eye-witnesses--officers and soldiers--tell everybody to-day how those
 women descended, practically straight from the railway carriages,
 after forty days’ travelling, beside the stretchers with wounded,
 and helped to dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
 centre and also a wing of the retreating army.For fifteen months she
 remained with those men, whose _rôle_ is not yet fully realised, but
 is certain to become one of the most wonderful and characteristic
 facts of the conflagration of nations.’

The Edinburgh Committee had already so many undertakings on behalf of
the S.W.H.that they gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S.to undertake the whole work of organising this
last adventure for the Serbian Army.Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main, and to them she sent
the voluminous and brilliant reports of her work.When the Russian
revolution imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the Rumanian
front, she sent home members of her unit, charged with important
verbal messages to her Government.Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages, unmistakably her
own, came back to the London Committee, that they might order her to
return.She would come with the Serbian Army and not without them.We
at home had to rest on the assurances of the Foreign Office, always
alive to the care and encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr.Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be expedited at the
safest hour.In those assurances we learnt to rest, and the British
Government did not fail that allied force--the Serbian Army and the
Scottish women serving them.The following letters were those written
to her family with notes from her graphic report to her Committees.The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed even in those last
days, when those who were with her knew that nothing but the spirit
kept the wasted body at its work.‘The Serbian Division is superb; we
are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the last words in her last
letter from Odessa in June 1917.That pride of service runs through
all the correspondence.The spirit she inspired is noteworthy in a
book which covers the greater part of these fifteen months, _With the
Scottish Nurses in Rumania_, by Yvonne Fitzroy.In a daily diary a
searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences borne with
such high-hearted nonchalance by the leader and her gallant disciples.Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:

 ‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being could do the work
 she accomplished.Her record piece of work perhaps was at Galatz,
 Rumania, at the end of the retreat.There were masses and masses of
 wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed operations and
 dressings for fifty-eight hours out of sixty-three.Scott, of the
 armoured cars, noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
 been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to Mrs.Milne,
 the cook, who kept us supplied with hot soup.” She had been very
 tired for a long time; undoubtedly the lack of food, the necessity of
 sleeping on the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
 her health.In Russia she was getting gradually more tired until she
 became ill.When she was the least bit better she was up again, and
 all the time she attended to the business of the unit.‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the last two or
 three days on board ship, we know now, she was dying.She made all the
 arrangements for the unit which she brought with her, however, and
 interviewed every member of it.To Miss Onslow, her transport officer,
 she said, when she arrived at Newcastle, “I shall be up in London in a
 few days’ time, and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
 Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’

      ‘H.M.TRANSPORT ----,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are more than half way through our voyage.We
 got off eventually on Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the
 river.You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this was when
 we came on board.The captain had been taken off an American liner the
 day before.The only officer who had been on this boat before was the
 engineer officer.The crew were drunk to a man,
 and, as the Transport officer said, “The only way to get this ship
 right, is to get her _out_.” So we got out.I must say we got into
 shape very quickly.We cleaned up, and now we are painting.They won’t
 know her when she gets back.She is an Austrian Lloyd captured at the
 beginning of the war, and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean
 since.She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck the
 Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done, so she was brought
 down to the port we started from--as she was.The captain seems to be an awfully good man.He is Scotch,
 and was on the Anchor Line to Bombay.She has all our equipment, fourteen of our cars.For passengers,
 there are ourselves, seventy-five people, and three Serbian officers,
 and the mother and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian
 non-commissioned officers.On the saloon deck there are
 twenty-two very small, single cabins.And on this deck larger cabins
 with either three or four berths.I am on this deck in the most
 luxurious quarters.It is called _The Commanding Officer’s Cabin_
 (ahem).There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it on one side
 another cabin with a writing-table and sofa, and off it on the other
 side a bathroom and dressing-room!Of course, if we had had rough
 weather, and the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been so
 nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is blackened, but
 we have had perfectly glorious weather.At night every porthole and
 window is closed to shut in the light, but the whole ship is very well
 ventilated.A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one of
 the lorries.‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice of us, so we took
 no notice of it.We had all our boats allotted to us the very first
 day.We divided the unit among them, putting one responsible person
 in charge of each, and had boat drill several times.Then one day the
 captain sounded the alarm for practice, and everybody was at their
 station in three minutes in greatcoat and life-belt.The amusing
 thing was that some of them thought it was a real alarm, and were
 most annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a submarine
 really there!The unit as a whole seems very nice and capable, though
 there are one or two queer characters!But most of them are healthy,
 wholesome bricks of girls.Of course
 a field hospital is quite a new bit of work.‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.The voyage
 has been a most pleasant one in every way.As soon as sea-sickness
 was over the unit developed a tremendous amount of energy, and we
 have had games on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
 competition!All this in addition to drill every morning, which was
 compulsory.‘We began the day at 8.30--breakfast, the cabins were tidied.9.30--roll call and cabin inspection immediately after; then
 drill--ordinary drill, stretcher drill, and Swedish drill in sections.Lunch was at 12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
 and French, to which they could go if they liked, and most of them
 took one, or even two, and lectures on motor construction, etc.Tea at
 4, and dinner 6.30.You would have thought there was not much time for
 anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British unit manages
 to put a good deal more in.(The head of a British unit in Serbia
 once said to me that the chief duty of the head of a British unit was
 to use up the superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways.He
 said that the only time there was no superfluous energy was when the
 unit was overworking.That was the time I found that particular unit
 playing rounders!)I was standing next
 to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he suddenly turned to
 me and said, “C’est tout-à-fait nouveau pour nous, Madame.” I thought
 it must be, for at that moment they were getting under a sail which
 had been tied down to the deck--two of them hurled themselves on the
 sail and dived under it, you saw four legs kicking wildly, and then
 the sail heaved and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
 other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went through, and so
 on.I should think it was indeed _tout-à-fait nouveau_.Some of the
 dresses at the fancy dress competition were most clever.There was
 Napoleon--the last phase, in the captain’s long coat and somebody’s
 epaulettes, and one of our grey hats, side to the front, excellent;
 and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts.One of
 them got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the engine-room
 to get properly dirty, with such successful result that, when she was
 coming up to the saloon, with her little oiling can in her hand, one
 of the officers stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
 lad?”

 ‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems, the Serbs leading
 their own.‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to hear them
 chattering and laughing along the passages, for they’ll have plenty
 of hard work later.We had service on Sunday, which I took, as
 the captain could not come down.Could you get us some copies of
 the Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers?The captain declares he was snap-shotted six times
 one morning.I don’t know if the Russian Government will let us take
 all these cameras with us.We are flying the Union Jack for the first
 time to-day since we came out.It is good to know you are all thinking
 of us.--Ever your loving sister,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘ON THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are well on our way to Moscow, having got
 through Archangel in 2½ days--a feat, for we were told at home that it
 might be six weeks.They did not know that there is a party of our
 naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel is magnificently
 organised now.‘When one realises that the population was 5000 before the war,
 and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there was bound to be some
 disorganisation at first.‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected at Archangel
 just now.They simply did everything for us, and sent us off in a
 train with a berth for each person, and gave us a wonderful send off.The Russian Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
 ring whenever it is produced.The first time it was really quite
 startling.We were longing for Nyamdonia where we were to get dinner.We were told we should be there at four o’clock, then at five, and
 at six o’clock we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began
 to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it was, and was
 shunting trucks.Miss Little, one of our Russian-speaking people,
 and I got out.We tried our united eloquence, she in fluent Russian,
 and I saying, _Shechaz_, which means “immediately” at intervals, and
 still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and a half.” Then I
 produced my letter, and you never saw such a change.They said, “Five
 minutes,” and we were off in three.We tried it all along the line
 after that; my own belief is that we should still be at the unknown
 place, without that letter, shunting trucks.At one station, Miss
 Little heard the station-master saying, “There is a great row going
 on here, and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t got
 through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at 11.30, and found a
 delightful Russian officer, and an excellent dinner paid for by the
 Russian Government, waiting for us.We all thought the food very good,
 and I thought the sauce of hunger helped.The next day, profiting
 over our Nyamdonia experience, I said meals were to be had at regular
 times from our stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
 as we found them, with the result that we arrived at Vorega, where
 _déjeuner_ had been ordered just as we finished a solid lunch of ham
 and eggs.I said they had better go out and have two more courses,
 which they did with great content, and found it quite as nice as the
 night before.‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers and
 non-coms.We broke a coupling after we left Nyamdonia, and they sent
 out another carriage from there, but it had not top berths, so they
 had another sleeper ready when we reached Vologda.They gave us
 another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because we asked for it, and
 have repaired cisterns, and given us chickens and eggs; and when we
 thank them, they say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
 three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time, quite silently in
 the stations.In Archangel one old man asked, “Who, on God’s earth,
 are you?”

 ‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!Russian soldiers were
 drawn up between the ship and the train, and cheered us the whole way,
 with a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with a drum
 and a fife and various other instruments, and marched about singing.Then they made speeches, and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the
 Russian soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them up and
 down, up and down, till they were stopped by a whistle.But they had
 got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I
 fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British
 Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I
 found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
 hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand
 to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that
 they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they
 tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,
 and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport
 because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and
 then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some
 of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our
 Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British
 colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain
 Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless
 you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply
 gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr
 had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,
 and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner
 with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and
 seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they
 are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our
 bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us
 this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,
      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and
 _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the
 conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;
 with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very
 comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along
 the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,
 or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I
 don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the
 Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of
 us in her motor.She has a beautiful
 hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the
 Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had
 a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I
 carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in
 the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not
 sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in
 hand.When M. Malinina said it was
 time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was
 quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.It is wonderful even now
 what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
 peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled
 water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to
 Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,
 as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on
 the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We
 certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are
 tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our
 Division.We were told this is the important point in the war
 just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command
 against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken
 prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,
 and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little
 field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision
 for our own men.We saw the
 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the
 war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they
 are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
 dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired
 home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red
 Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are
 splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can
 imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such
 a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and
 our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had
 a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to
 carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on
 the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the
 city while we were there.Odessa
 is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting
 while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things
 were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the
 opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something
 to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole
 house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing
 our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow
 since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in
 three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it
 has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the
 lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same
 day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We
 evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we
 were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved
 on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and
 seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have
 sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,

      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,
 and _good_ things.’

      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,
      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and
 Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over
 from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,
 and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the
 doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at
 Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a
 very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the
 _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the
 day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
 hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we
 unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice
 hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck
 the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating
 rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being
 brought back five versts.Then we were told to
 send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the
 _personnel_.The whole country was covered with
 groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and
 Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through
 the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places
 the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were
 throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,
 being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way
 of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on
 to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head
 over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different
 stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw
 in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the
 next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in
 barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent
 the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in
 Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that
 place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an
 officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official
 figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without
 stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in
 their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the
 trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing
 I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were
 evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through
 everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at
 home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in
 the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,
 “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another
 Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one
 will ever doubt them again.”

 ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of
 British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing
 floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the
 stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told
 in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments
 through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of
 radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather
 stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking
 of us.--Your loving sister,

      ‘E.I.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN
      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly
 wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have
 got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
 getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow
 into the Expedition houses.I
 remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping
 and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like
 Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One
 unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,
 though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought
 it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised
 that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get
 the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The
 poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the
 hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in
 another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first
 time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian
 Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that
 the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
 the language.We have got a
 certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them
 curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable
 way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,
 twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we
 cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,
 and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem
 to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and
 telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and
 get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got
 the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through
 things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The
 whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this
 gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that
 they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold
 on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well
 to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to
 know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and
 that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel
 how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian
 said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has
 got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of
 you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall
 pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is
 possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must
 find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_

      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came
 out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a
 Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and
 Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying
 right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,
 and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
 left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and
 show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came
 away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children
 in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will
 be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,
 they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the
 crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able
 to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and
 pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,
 sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were
 little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as
 gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of
 carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what
 the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,
 is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have
 got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and
 bandages.Blessings on you, precious
 little girl.--Your loving aunt,

      ELSIE.’

 ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them
 speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is
 having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”
 He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”
 and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a
 practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such
 snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber
 boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their
 throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for
 the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,
 and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across
 the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The
 Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in
 seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I
 would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about
 forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it
 was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all
 into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the
 men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the
 mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end
 stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients
 were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was
 very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies
 was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single
 louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one
 blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get
 quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home
 last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little
 room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever
 your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘_March 23, 1917._

 ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from
 Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home
 knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on
 the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and
 beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any
 case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One
 Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about
 the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the
 most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas
 began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long
 before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had
 had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
 we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia
 after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming
 sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince
 Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite
 unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming
 arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the
 head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two
 minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of
 his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then
 said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and
 said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was
 for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a
 silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully
 pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a
 rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
 the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its
 ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that
 they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must
 live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
 sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our
 C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she
 added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate
 hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the
 thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up
 “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious
 people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The
 priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey
 cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service
 in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The
 four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at
 the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he
 sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner
 of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as
 they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung
 every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those
 poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the
 village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud
 holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera
 Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have
 returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured
 Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of
 their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the
 operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an
 Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the
 second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that
 there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the
 men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”
 I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all
 night.’

      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and
 Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who
 are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the
 truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this
 beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and
 much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks
 for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low
 and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we
 have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our
 allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of
 all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the
 Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_

      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,
      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’

      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the
 original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are
 very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital
 voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets
 all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss
 Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all
 so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very
 soon I think.We are having
 glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the
 mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,
 but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about
 our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take
 over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great
 score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It
 was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having
 had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses
 first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood
 so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._

 ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious
 view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve
 the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as
 they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,
 so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,
 and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a
 drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly
 who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,
 from the office.We had an awful
 two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most
 thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw
 the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General
 Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section
 sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came
 off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a
 charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved
 the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,
 but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told
 the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy
 fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution
 in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I
 supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what
 effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away
 with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,
 the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in
 the very concrete form of _us_.We should have played right into the
 devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,
 and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,
 understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen
 on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General
 in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’
 department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting
 on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen
 indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian
 fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very
 few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the
 courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with
 lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter
 service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
 the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz
 to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s
 voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are
 delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating
 place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden
 away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport
 horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride
 of course.‘_On Active Service._

      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,
      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are
 subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought
 of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have
 come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable
 person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this
 place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the
 Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when
 she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her
 house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the
 Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The
 Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche
 bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever
 it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you
 recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients
 were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian
 Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good
 and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite
 a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let
 the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_
 undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.Daniel went back to the hallway.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due

 loving aunt,

CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

Transcriber’s note:

Illustrations have been moved to be near the text they illustrate.A very few changes have been made to punctuation for consistency.On page 210 “C’état” has been changed to “C’était” in “C’était
magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros”.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was a commission as captain, and detailed him as an independent
scout, subject to the orders of General William Nelson."Why, General," stammered Fred, "I didn't want this.You know, you told
me it was better for me not to enlist.""I know," responded Nelson, "but as you are with the army so much, it is
better for you to wear a uniform and have a rank that will command
respect."So Fred became "captain" in earnest.During his conversations with Nelson, Fred told him what he had heard
his father say to his aunt about Grant and Buell being crushed in
detail, and the general became thoroughly imbued with the idea that the
army at Pittsburg Landing was in grave danger.He chafed like a caged tiger at the delay in crossing Duck
river.At length he sought Buell, who laughed at his fears, and said
that he would not move until the bridge was completed."Why, Nelson, what's the matter with you any way?""Here we have been puttering
with this bridge for nearly a week, and all this time the force at
Pittsburg Landing is in danger of being attacked and annihilated."Buell leaned back in his chair, and looking quizzically at Nelson, said:

"You seem to know more about it, General, than either Halleck or Grant.Halleck telegraphed me that there is no danger of the force at Pittsburg
Landing being attacked.""I don't care what Halleck telegraphs," roared Nelson, now thoroughly
aroused."I tell you there is; I feel it, I know it."asked Buell, showing considerable interest.A small force encamped only
twenty miles from Corinth, where Johnston is concentrating his army.Johnston is a fool if he doesn't attack, and no one yet has ever accused
him of being one.General, give my division the advance; let me ford
Duck river."Buell was really fond of Nelson, despite his rough, overbearing ways,
and after some hesitation gave him the required permission.The life of
General Grant might not read as it does now, if that permission had been
withheld.On the morning of March 29th Nelson's division forded Duck river, and
started on its forced march for Savannah, on the Tennessee river.On
this march Nelson showed no mercy to stragglers, and many were the
curses heaped upon his head.One day Fred found a boy, no older than himself, lashed behind a cannon.The lad belonged to an Indiana regiment that in some manner had incurred
the displeasure of the general, and he was particularly severe on
members of this regiment if found straggling.The boy in question had
been found away from his command, and had been tied by his wrists to a
cannon.Behind this gun he had to march through the mud, every jolt
sending sharp pain through his wrists and arms, and if he should fall
life itself would be imperiled.It was a heartless, and in this case,
cruel punishment.Fred noticed the boy, and rode up to him and asked him
his name, and he gave it as Hugh Raymond.He was a fine-looking fellow,
and seemed to feel deeply his humiliation.He was covered with mud, and
the tears that he could not hold back had left their dirty trail down
his cheeks.Fred went to Nelson, begged for the boy's release, and got
it.It was but few requests that Nelson would not grant Fred.When Nelson started on his march to Savannah he expected to reach that
place on April 7th.But once on the march his eagerness increased, and
he resolved to reach Savannah, if possible, by the 4th, or at least the
5th of the month.On the morning of the third day's march Fred met with an adventure that
haunted him for years afterward.He never thought of it without a
shudder, and over and over again he lived it in his dreams, awaking with
a cry of agony that sounded unearthly to those who heard it.General Nelson and staff had put up at the commodious house of a planter
named Lane.They were most hospitably entertained, although Mr.Lane
made no secret of the fact that he was an ardent sympathizer with the
South.In the morning, as Fred was about to mount his horse to resume the
march, he discovered that he had left his field-glass in the room he had
occupied during the night.On returning for it, he heard voices in the
next room, one of which sounded so familiar that he stopped a moment to
listen, and to his amazement recognized the voice of his cousin Calhoun.One thing was certain; he
had been exchanged and was once more in the army.Lane
were engaged in earnest conversation, and Fred soon learned that his
cousin had been concealed in the house during the night."I have," replied Calhoun, "thanks to your kindness.I heard Nelson say
he would rush his division through, and that he wanted to be in Savannah
by the 5th.Johnston must,
shall strike Grant before that time.I must be in Corinth within the
next twenty-four hours, if I kill a dozen horses in getting there.Is
my horse where I left him, at the stable in the woods?"Lane; "and well cared for and groomed.But
breakfast is ready; you must eat a hearty meal before you start."Fred realized that the fate of an army was at stake.Something must be
done, and that something must be done quickly.Slipping out of the
house, he took a look around.Back of the house about a half a mile
distant was a thick piece of wood.A lane led through the fields to this
wood.No doubt it was there that Calhoun's horse was concealed.Fred quickly made up his mind what to do.Mounting his horse, he rode
rapidly away until out of sight of the house; then, making Prince jump
the fence, he rode through the field until he reached the wood, and then
back nearly to the lane he had noticed.Tying his horse, he crept close
to the path, and concealed himself.He soon saw
Calhoun coming up the path with quick, springing steps.To Fred's great
joy he was alone.He let him pass, and then stealthily as an Indian
followed him.Calhoun soon reached the rude stable, and went in."Now, my hearty," said he, as he patted his horse, "we have a long hard
ride before us.But we carry news, my boy--news that may mean
independence to the Sunny South."Strong arms were suddenly thrown around him, and despite his desperate
resistance and struggles, he soon found himself lying on his face, his
hands held behind his back and securely tied.His ankles were then
firmly bound together.When all this was done he was raised to his feet
and a voice said:

"Sorry, Cal, but I had to do it," and to Calhoun's amazement his cousin
stood before him, panting from his exertion.For a moment Calhoun was speechless with astonishment; then his rage
knew no limit, and bound as he was, he tried to get at his cousin."I reckon," said Fred, quietly, "that I must make you more secure," and
taking a stout strap he lashed him securely to a post."Is this the way you keep your oath?"hissed Calhoun, and he spat at
Fred in his contempt."Loose me, you sneaking villain, loose me at once,
or I will raise an alarm, and Mr.Lane and his men will be here, and
they will make short work of you."Just then the notes of a bugle, sweet and clear, came floating through
the air."You had better raise no alarm;
McCook's division is passing, and I have but to say a word and you
swing."Calhoun ground his teeth in impotent rage.At last he asked:

"Fred, what do you want?Have you not sworn to
guard my life as sacredly as your own?"Fred stood looking at his cousin a moment, as if in deep thought; then
an expression of keenest pain came over his face, and he said in a
strained, unnatural voice:

"Calhoun, believe me, I would I were dead instead of standing before you
as I do now.""I should think that you would, if you have a vestige of honor left,"
answered Calhoun, with a sneer."An oath, which an honorable man would
hold more sacred than life itself seems to be lightly regarded by you.""I shall come to that directly," replied Fred, in the same unnatural
tone.To him his voice sounded afar off, as if some one else were
talking."Now, Calhoun, listen; you have a secret, a secret on which the fate of
an army depends."Calhoun, you have been
playing the spy again.do you hear the tramp of McCook's columns.If I did my duty I would cry, 'Here is a spy,' and what then?"Calhoun's face grew ashen; then his natural bravery came to his rescue."I defy you," he exclaimed, his eyes flaming with wrath."Hang me if you
will, and then in the sight of God behold yourself a murderer worse than
Cain.""Calhoun, once more I say, listen.The information that you have you
shall not take to Johnston.What I do now
would hang me instead of you, if Buell knew.But I trust you with more
than life; I trust you with my honor.Give me your sacred word that you
will keep away from Corinth until after Buell and Grant have joined
forces; promise as sacredly that you will not directly or indirectly
divulge in any manner to any person the knowledge you have gained, and I
will release you."Calhoun looked Fred in the face, hesitated, and then slowly answered:
"You seem to think I have more honor and will keep an oath better than
yourself."Calhoun," he cried, "you do not, you cannot mean
it.Promise, for the love of heaven,
promise!""I will not promise, I will die first," replied Calhoun, doggedly.A
faint hope was arising in his mind that Fred was only trying to frighten
him; that he had only to remain firm, and that, at the worst, Fred would
only try to keep him a prisoner.Calhoun's words were to Fred as a sentence of death.He sank on his
knees, and lifted his hands imploringly."Calhoun," he moaned, "see me, see me here at your feet.It is I, not
you, who is to be pitied.For the love we bear each other"--at the word
"love" Calhoun's lips curled in contempt--"for the sake of those near
and dear to us, for the honor of our names, promise, oh, promise me!"See, I spit on you, I despise you, defy
you.""Then you must die," replied Fred, slowly rising to his feet."Fred, you will not give me up to be
hanged?""No, Calhoun, your dishonor would be my dishonor.I cannot keep my oath,
and have you hanged as a spy.""I shall shoot you with my own hand.""You do not, cannot mean
that?""It is the only way I can keep my oath and still prevent you from
carrying the news that would mean destruction to Grant's army."How can you keep your oath by
murdering me?""Calhoun, I swore to consider your honor as sacred as my own, to value
your life as highly as my own, to share with you whatever fate might
come.After I put a bullet through your heart, I
shall put one through my own brain._We both must die._"

Calhoun's face seemed frozen with horror.He gasped and tried to speak,
but no words came."Calhoun," continued Fred, in a tone that sounded as a voice from one
dead, "would that you had promised, for it can do no good not to
promise.Now, say your prayers, for in a
moment we both will be standing before our Maker."Fred bowed his head in silent prayer; but Calhoun, with his
horror-stricken face, never took his eyes from off his cousin."Good-bye, Calhoun," said Fred, as he raised his revolver."For God's sake, don't shoot!The words seemed to explode
from Calhoun's lips.[Illustration: "For God's Sake, don't shoot!For a moment Fred stood as motionless as a statue, with the revolver
raised; then the weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and with a low
moan he plunged forward on his face.So long did he lie in a swoon that Calhoun thought he was dead, and
called to him in the most endearing tones.At last there was a slight
quivering of the limbs, then he began to moan; finally he sat up and
looked around as one dazed.Seeing Calhoun, he started, passed his hand
across his brow as if to collect his thoughts, and said, as if in
surprise: "Why, Calhoun----" Then it all came back to him in its terror
and awfulness, and he fell back sick and faint.Rallying, he struggled
to his feet, tottered to Calhoun, and cut the bonds that bound him."It will not do for us to be found here
together."The two boys clasped hands for a moment, then each turned and went his
separate way.When Fred joined Nelson an hour later the general looked at him sharply,
and asked: "What's the matter, Fred?You look ten years
older than you did yesterday.""I am not really sick, but I am not feeling well, General," replied
Fred; "and I believe, with your permission, I will take an ambulance for
the rest of the day.""Do, Fred, do," kindly replied Nelson, and for the rest of the day Fred
rode in an ambulance, where he could be alone with his thoughts.That evening he asked General Nelson when he expected the division would
reach Savannah."By the 5th, if possible, on the 6th anyway," answered the general."Make it the 5th, General; don't let anything stop you; hurry!Nelson looked after him and muttered: "I wonder what's the matter with
the boy; he hasn't appeared himself to-day; but it may be he will be all
right in the morning.I shall take his advice and hurry, anyway."The next day Nelson urged on his men with a fury that caused the air to
be blue with oaths.And it was well that he did, or Shiloh would have
never been reached in time to aid the gallant soldiers of Grant.Buell saw no need of hurrying.He thought it would be a fine thing to
concentrate his whole army at Waynesborough and march into Savannah with
flying colors, showing Grant what a grand army he had.He telegraphed
General Halleck for permission to do so, and the request was readily
granted.In some manner it became known to the Confederate spies that
Buell's army was to halt at Waynesborough, and the glad tidings were
quickly borne to General Johnston, and when that general marched forth
to battle he had no expectation that he would have to meet any of
Buell's men.General Buell hurried forward to stop Nelson at Waynesborough, according
to his plan; but to his chagrin he found that Nelson, in his headlong
haste, was already beyond Waynesborough, and so the plan of stopping him
had to be given up.When General Nelson's advance was a little beyond Waynesborough, a party
engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Savannah to
Nashville was met.A telegram was handed their general, which read:


     TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING BUELL'S ADVANCE:

     There is no need of haste; come on by easy stages.U. S. GRANT,
     Major-General Commanding.Nelson read the telegram, and turning to Fred said:

"This is small comfort for all my hurry.I wonder if I have made a fool
of myself, after all.Buell will have the joke on me, sure.""Better be that way than have you needed and not there," answered Fred."If we are needed and are not there, Grant can only blame himself," was
Nelson's reply.At noon on April 5th Ammen's brigade, the advance of Nelson's division,
marched into Savannah.Colonel Ammen reported his arrival, and said:

"My men are not tired; we can march on to Pittsburg Landing if
necessary."The answer was: "Rest, and make your men comfortable.There will be no
battle at Pittsburg Landing.Boats will be sent for you in a day or
two."There was to be a rude awakening on the morrow."The sun of Austerlitz" was neither brighter nor more glorious than the
sun which arose over the field of Shiloh Sunday morning, April 6, 1862.Around the little log chapel, wont to echo to the voice of prayer and
song of praise, along the hillsides and in the woods, lay encamped the
Federal army.The soldiers had lain down the night before without a
thought of what this bright, sunny Sabbath would bring forth.A sense of
security pervaded the whole army.From commander down to private, there
was scarcely a thought of an attack."I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack," wrote Grant to Halleck
on April 5th.On the evening of the same day Sherman wrote to Grant: "I do not
apprehend anything like an attack upon our position."Yet when these words were written the Confederate army was in battle
array not much over three miles distant.But there was one general in the Federal army who was uneasy, he hardly
knew why.He was little known at the time, he never held a
distinguished command afterward; yet it was by his vigilance that the
Federal army was saved from surprise, perhaps from capture.A vague idea that something was wrong haunted him.The
ominous silence in front oppressed him, as something to be feared.An unusual number of squirrels and
rabbits were noticed dodging through the line, and they were all headed
in one direction--toward Pittsburg Landing.To guard more surely against surprise Prentiss posted his pickets a mile
and a half in front of his lines, an unusual distance.At three o'clock
Sunday morning he sent three companies of the Twenty-fifth Missouri out
on a reconnoitering expedition.These three companies followed a road
that obliqued to the right, and a little after daylight met the enemy's
advance in front of Sherman's division.Thus the battle of Shiloh
opened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the
Confederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen
minutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major
Hardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he
fought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general
advance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along
the line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston
Johnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was
fired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along
the whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been
fighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was
startled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily
writing an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his
division up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left
his breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon
steaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of
General Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace
hold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his
chief-of-staff, Grant said:

"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of
raw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are
all right.""It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,"
answered Rawlins."Yes," answered Grant, "but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general
attack."It sounds very much like it," replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all
doubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men
had commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to
come at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem
the tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments
which had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most
needed.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his
generals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and
all would be well.Some of his regiments
had broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of
danger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,
pleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be
careful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: "If
I can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it."Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: "General, I did not
expect this; forgive me.""I am your senior general," answered Sherman."You depended on me for
reports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an
attack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by
my side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward."There is nothing to forgive," he said, gently."The mistake is mine as well as yours.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will
soon be here, and we will whip them; never fear."By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond
his camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.
Wallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the
field was afterward known as the "Hornet's Nest."Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told
them to hold it to the last man."We will," responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat
against them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and
bleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army
were bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken
soldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:
"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry."Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the
Union lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised
Johnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments
had been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus
gain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time
hurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to
charge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and
said: "I will lead you, my children."With wild cheers his men pressed forward;
nothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was
crushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate
army stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died
away, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the
respite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to
pieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of
General Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With
anxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the
first fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer
reports: "Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further
from the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead
of hurrying forward left in front.Then he
is marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face."He
countermarched; coming slow," he said, as if to himself, "Great God,
what does he mean?"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: "Plant the siege guns around the
Landing.See that you have every available piece of artillery in
position."And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between
Grant's army and utter rout."Have you any way of retreat mapped out?"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,
viewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of
demoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: "Retreat!I
have not yet despaired of victory."Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from
the center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'
divisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and
Prentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten
o'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their
lines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung
every time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every
side.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he
was cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than
Wallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were
doomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last
stand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides
up to him."General," he says, "Sherman reports that he has taken his last
position.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what
stragglers he has gathered."Go back," quietly said Grant, "and tell Sherman to hold if possible;
night is most here."McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had
furnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now
an orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,
came spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:

"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most
gallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable
reason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the
Landing.""Go tell McClernand," said Grant, "that he has done well, but he must
hold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up."General," he said, in a broken voice, "my division is gone, the whole
left is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.""General," replied Grant, without a quiver, "rally what broken regiments
and stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on
McClernand, and hold your position to the last man."Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and
soldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there."Sandra journeyed to the office."The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."[5]  Other ceremonies there
are--ancient and mediaeval.Some are full of beauty, but none are
essential.Thus, in the first Prayer Book of 1549, a white vesture,
called the _Chrisome_[6] or _Chrism_, was put upon the candidate, the
Priest saying: "Take this white vesture for a token of innocency which,
by God's grace, in the Holy Sacrament of Baptism, is given unto thee".It typified the white life to which the one anointed with the Chrisma,
or symbolical oil, was dedicated.[7]

Another ancient custom was to give the newly baptized _milk and honey_.Clement of Alexandria writes: "As soon as we are born again, we
become entitled to the hope of rest, the promise of Jerusalem which is
above, where it is said to rain milk and
