The situation in which he found himself seemed almost to invite
destruction.On the eighteenth of March he had sent the best of his men,
some twenty-five of them, with his Inspector, to join the Alberta Field
Force at Calgary, whence they made that famous march to Edmonton of over
two hundred miles in four and a half marching days.From Calgary, too,
had gone a picked body of Police with Superintendent Strong and his
scouts as part of the Alberta Field Force under General Strange.Thus
it came that by the end of April the Superintendent at Fort Macleod had
under his command only a handful of his trained Police, supported by two
or three companies of Militia--who, with all their ardor, were unskilled
in plain-craft, strange to the country, new to war, ignorant of the
habits and customs and temper of the Indians with whom they were
supposed to deal--to hold the vast extent of territory under his charge,
with its little scattered hamlets of settlers, safe in the presence of
the largest and most warlike of the Indian tribes in Western Canada.A crisis appeared to be
reached when the news came that on the twenty-fourth of April General
Middleton had met a check at Fish Creek, which, though not specially
serious in itself, revealed the possibilities of the rebel strategy and
gave heart to the enemy immediately engaged.And, though Fish Creek was no great fight, the rumor of it ran through
the Western reserves like red fire through prairie-grass, blowing almost
into flame the war-spirit of the young braves of the Bloods, Piegans
and Sarcees and even of the more stable Blackfeet.Three days after that
check, the news of it was humming through every tepee in the West,
and for a week or more it took all the cool courage and steady nerve
characteristic of the Mounted Police to enable them to ride without
flurry or hurry their daily patrols through the reserves.At this crisis it was that the Superintendent at Macleod gathered
together such of his officers and non-commissioned officers as he could
in council at Fort Calgary, to discuss the situation and to plan for all
possible emergencies.The full details of the Fish Creek affair had just
come in.They were disquieting enough, although the Superintendent made
light of them.On the wall of the barrack-room where the council was
gathered there hung a large map of the Territories.The Superintendent,
a man of small oratorical powers, undertook to set forth the disposition
of the various forces now operating in the West."Here you observe the main line running west from Regina to the
mountains, some five hundred and fifty miles," he said."And here,
roughly, two hundred and fifty miles north, is the northern boundary
line of our settlements, Prince Albert at the east, Battleford at the
center, Edmonton at the west, each of these points the center of a
country ravaged by half-breeds and bands of Indians.To each of these
points relief-expeditions have been sent."This line represents the march of Commissioner Irvine from Regina to
Prince Albert--a most remarkable march that was too, gentlemen, nearly
three hundred miles over snow-bound country in about seven days.That
march will be remembered, I venture to say.The Commissioner still holds
Prince Albert, and we may rely upon it will continue to hold it safe
against any odds.Meantime he is scouting the country round about,
preventing Indians from reinforcing the enemy in any large numbers."Next, to the west is Battleford, which holds the central position and
is the storm-center of the rebellion at present.This line shows the
march of Colonel Otter with Superintendent Herchmer from Swift Current
to that point.We have just heard that Colonel Otter has arrived at
Battleford and has raised the siege.But large bands of Indians are
in the vicinity of Battleford and the situation there is extremely
critical.I understand that old Oo-pee-too-korah-han-apee-wee-yin--" the
Superintendent prided himself upon his mastery of Indian names and
ran off this polysyllabic cognomen with the utmost facility--"the
Pond-maker, or Pound-maker as he has come to be called, is in the
neighborhood.He is not a bad fellow, but he is a man of unusual
ability, far more able than of the Willow Crees, Beardy, as he is
called, though not so savage, and he has a large and compact body of
Indians under him."Then here straight north from us some two hundred miles is Edmonton,
the center of a very wide district sparsely settled, with a strong
half-breed element in the immediate neighborhood and Big Bear and Little
Pine commanding large bodies of Indians ravaging the country round
about.Inspector Griesbach is in command of this district, located
at Fort Saskatchewan, which is in close touch with Edmonton.General
Strange, commanding the Alberta Field Force and several companies of
Militia, together with our own men under Superintendent Strong and
Inspector Dickson, are on the way to relieve this post.Inspector
Dickson, I understand, has successfully made the crossing of the Red
Deer with his nine pr.gun, a quite remarkable feat I assure you."But, gentlemen, you see the position in which we are placed in
this section of the country.From the Cypress Hills here away to the
southeast, westward to the mountains and down to the boundary-line,
you have a series of reserves almost completely denuded of Police
supervision.True, we are fortunate in having at the Blackfoot Crossing,
at Fort Calgary and at Fort Macleod, companies of Militia; but the very
presence of these troops incites the Indians, and in some ways is a
continual source of unrest among them."Every day runners from the North and East come to our reserves with
extraordinary tales of rebel victories.This Fish Creek business has had
a tremendous influence upon the younger element.On every reserve there
are scores of young braves eager to rise.What a general uprising would
mean you know, or think you know.An Indian war of extermination is
a horrible possibility.The question before us all is--what is to be
done?"After a period of conversation the Superintendent summed up the results
of the discussion in a few short sentences:

"It seems, gentlemen, there is not much more to be done than what we
are already doing.But first of all I need not say that we must keep our
nerve.I do not believe any Indian will see any sign of doubt or fear in
the face of any member of this Force.Our patrols must be regularly
and carefully done.There are a lot of things which we must not see, a
certain amount of lawbreaking which we must not notice.Avoid on every
possible occasion pushing things to extremes; but where it is necessary
to act we must act with promptitude and fearlessness, as Mr.Cameron
here did at the Piegan Reserve a week or so ago.I mention this because
I consider that action of Cameron's a typically fine piece of Police
work.We must keep on good terms with the Chiefs, tell them what good
news there is to tell.Arrest
them and bring them to the barracks.The situation is grave, but not
hopeless.I do not
believe that we shall fail."The little company broke up with resolute and grim determination stamped
on every face.There would be no weakening at any spot where a Mounted
Policeman was on duty."Cameron, just a moment," said the Superintendent as he was passing out.You were quite right in that Eagle Feather matter.You did
the right thing in pushing that hard.""I somehow felt I could do it, sir," replied Cameron simply."I had the
feeling in my bones that we could have taken the whole camp that day."And that is the way we should
feel.If any further reverse should happen to our troops it will be extremely
difficult, if indeed possible, to hold back the younger braves.If there
should be a rising--which may God forbid--my plan then would be to back
right on to the Blackfeet Reserve.If old Crowfoot keeps steady--and
with our presence to support him I believe he would--we could hold
things safe for a while.But, Cameron, that Sioux devil Copperhead must
be got rid of.It is he that is responsible for this restless spirit
among the younger Chiefs.He has been in the East, you say, for the last
three weeks, but he will soon be back.His
work lies here, and the only hope for the rebellion lies here, and he
knows it.My scouts inform me that there is something big immediately
on.A powwow is arranged somewhere before final action.I have reason to
suspect that if we sustain another reverse and if the minor Chiefs from
all the reserves come to an agreement, Crowfoot will yield.That is the
game that the Sioux is working on now.""I know that quite well, sir," replied Cameron."Copperhead has captured
practically all the minor Chiefs.""The checking of that big cattle-run, Cameron, was a mighty good stroke
for us."Yes, yes, we do owe a good deal to--to--that--to Raven.Yes, we owe a lot to him, but we owe a lot to you as
well, Cameron.I am not saying you will ever get any credit for it,
but--well--who cares so long as the thing is done?But this Sioux must
be got at all costs--at all costs, Cameron, remember.I have never
asked you to push this thing to the limit, but now at all costs, dead or
alive, that Sioux must be got rid of.""I could have potted him several times," replied Cameron, "but did not
wish to push matters to extremes."That has been our policy hitherto, but now
things have reached such a crisis that we can take no further chances."All right, sir," said Cameron, and a new purpose shaped itself in his
heart.At all costs he would get the Sioux, alive if possible, dead if
not.Plainly the first thing was to uncover his tracks, and with this
intention Cameron proceeded to the Blackfeet Reserve, riding with Jerry
down the Bow River from Fort Calgary, until, as the sun was setting on
an early May evening, he came in sight of the Blackfoot Crossing.Not wishing to visit the Militia camp at that point, and desiring
to explore the approaches of the Blackfeet Reserve with as little
ostentation as possible, he sent Jerry on with the horses, with
instructions to meet him later on in the evening on the outside of the
Blackfeet camp, and took a side trail on foot leading to the reserve
through a coulee.Through the bottom of the coulee ran a little
stream whose banks were packed tight with alders, willows and poplars.Following the trail to where it crossed the stream, Cameron left it for
the purpose of quenching his thirst, and proceeded up-stream some little
way from the usual crossing.Lying there prone upon his face he caught
the sound of hoofs, and, peering through the alders, he saw a line
of Indians riding down the opposite bank.Burying his head among the
tangled alders and hardly breathing, he watched them one by one cross
the stream not more than thirty yards away and clamber up the bank."Something doing here, sure enough," he said to himself as he noted
their faces.Three of them he knew, Red Crow of the Bloods, Trotting
Wolf of the Piegans, Running Stream of the Blackfeet, then came three
others unknown to Cameron, and last in the line Cameron was startled to
observe Copperhead himself, while close at his side could be seen the
slim figure of his son.As the Sioux passed by Cameron's hiding-place
he paused and looked steadily down into the alders for a moment or two,
then rode on."Saved yourself that time, old man," said Cameron as the Sioux
disappeared, following the others up the trail."We will see just which
trail you take," he continued, following them at a safe distance and
keeping himself hidden by the brush till they reached the open and
disappeared over the hill.Swiftly Cameron ran to the top, and, lying
prone among the prairie grass, watched them for some time as they took
the trail that ran straight westward."Sarcee Reserve more than likely," he muttered to himself.But he is not, so I must let them go in the meantime.Mary went back to the hallway.Later, however, we shall come up with you, gentlemen.And now for old
Crowfoot and with no time to lose."He had only a couple of miles to go and in a few minutes he had reached
the main trail from the Militia camp at the Crossing.In the growing
darkness he could not discern whether Jerry had passed with the horses
or not, so he pushed on rapidly to the appointed place of meeting and
there found Jerry waiting for him.I have just seen him
and his son with Red Crow, Trotting Wolf and Running Stream.There were
three others--Sioux I think they are; at any rate I did not know them.They passed me in the coulee and took the Sarcee trail."From the reserve here anyway," answered Cameron."Trotting Wolf beeg Chief--Red Crow beeg Chief--ver' bad!Dunno me--look somet'ing--beeg powwow mebbe.Go
Sarcee Reserve, heh?""Come from h'east--by
Blood--Piegan--den Blackfeet--go Sarcee."That is the question, Jerry," said Cameron."Sout' to Weegwam?No, nord to Ghost Reever--Manitou
Rock--dunno--mebbe.""By Jove, Jerry, I believe you may be right.I don't think they would go
to the Wigwam--we caught them there once--nor to the canyon."Nord from Bow Reever by Kananaskis half day to Ghost Reever--bad
trail--small leetle reever--ver' stony--ver' cold--beeg tree wit' long
beard.""Yes--long, long gray moss lak' beard--ver' strange place dat--from
Ghost Reever west one half day to beeg Manitou Rock--no trail.Beeg
medicine-dance dere--see heem once long tam' 'go--leetle boy me--beeg
medicine--Indian debbil stay dere--Indian much scare'--only go when mak'
beeg tam'--beeg medicine.""Let me see if I get you, Jerry.A bad trail leads half a day north from
the Bow at Kananaskis to Ghost River, eh?""Then up the Ghost River westward through the bearded trees half a day
to the Manitou Rock?"Beeg dat tree," pointing to a tall poplar,
"and cut straight down lak some knife--beeg rock--black rock.""What I want to know just now is does
Crowfoot know of this thing?Copperhead has just come from the reserve.It is possible, just possible, that he may not have seen Crowfoot.Now, Jerry, you must follow Copperhead, find out
where he has gone and all you can about this business, and meet me
where the trail reaches the Ghost River.Take a
trooper with you to look after the horses.If you are not at the Ghost River I shall go right on--that is if I see
any signs."And without further word he slipped on to his
horse and disappeared into the darkness, taking the cross-trail through
the coulee by which Cameron had come.Crowfoot's camp showed every sign of the organization and discipline of
a master spirit.The tents and houses in which his Indians lived were
extended along both sides of a long valley flanked at both ends by
poplar-bluffs.At the bottom of the valley there was a series of
"sleughs" or little lakes, affording good grazing and water for the
herds of cattle and ponies that could be seen everywhere upon the
hillsides.At a point farthest from the water and near to a poplar-bluff
stood Crowfoot's house.At the first touch of summer, however,
Crowfoot's household had moved out from their dwelling, after the manner
of the Indians, and had taken up their lodging in a little group of
tents set beside the house.Toward this little group of tents Cameron rode at an easy lope.He found
Crowfoot alone beside his fire, except for the squaws that were cleaning
up after the evening meal and the papooses and older children rolling
about on the grass.As Cameron drew near, all vanished, except Crowfoot
and a youth about seventeen years of age, whose strongly marked features
and high, fearless bearing proclaimed him Crowfoot's son.Dismounting,
Cameron dropped the reins over his horse's head and with a word of
greeting to the Chief sat down by the fire.Crowfoot acknowledged his
salutation with a suspicious look and grunt."Nice night, Crowfoot," said Cameron cheerfully."Good weather for the
grass, eh?""Good," said Crowfoot gruffly.Cameron pulled out his tobacco pouch and passed it to the Chief.With an
air of indescribable condescension Crowfoot took the pouch, knocked the
ashes from his pipe, filled it from the pouch and handed it back to the
owner.inquired Cameron, holding out the pouch toward the youth.grunted Crowfoot with a slight relaxing of his face.The lad stood like a statue, and, except for a slight stiffening of
his tall lithe figure, remained absolutely motionless, after the Indian
manner."Getting cold," said Cameron at length, as he kicked the embers of the
fire together.Crowfoot spoke to his son and the lad piled wood on the fire till it
blazed high, then, at a sign from his father, he disappeared into the
tent.That is better," said Cameron, stretching out his hands toward the
fire and disposing himself so that the old Chief's face should be set
clearly in its light.said Crowfoot in his own language,
after a long silence."Oh, sometimes," replied Cameron carelessly, "when cattle-thieves ride
too.""Yes, some Indians forget all that the Police have done for them,
and like coyotes steal upon the cattle at night and drive them over
cut-banks."inquired Crowfoot again, apparently much interested."Yes," continued Cameron, fully aware that he was giving the old Chief
no news, "Eagle Feather will be much wiser when he rides over the plains
again.""But Eagle Feather," continued Cameron, "is not the worst Indian.He is
no good, only a little boy who does what he is told.""Yes, he is an old squaw serving his Chief."again inquired Crowfoot, moving his pipe from his mouth in his
apparent anxiety to learn the name of this unknown master of Eagle
Feather."Onawata, the Sioux, is a great Chief," said Cameron."He makes all the little Chiefs, Blood, Piegan, Sarcee, Blackfeet obey
him," said Cameron in a scornful voice, shading his face from the fire
with his hand."But he has left this country for a while?""My brother has not seen this Sioux for some weeks?"Again Cameron's
hand shaded his face from the fire while his eyes searched the old
Chief's impassive countenance.Onawata bad man--make much
trouble.""The big war is going on good," said Cameron, abruptly changing the
subject."At Fish Creek the half-breeds and Indians had a
good chance to wipe out General Middleton's column."And he proceeded
to give a graphic account of the rebels' opportunity at that unfortunate
affair."But," he concluded, "the half-breeds and Indians have no
Chief.""No Chief," agreed Crowfoot with emphasis, his old eyes gleaming in
the firelight."Where Big Bear--Little
Pine--Kah-mee-yes-too-waegs and Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin?""Oh," said Cameron, "here, there, everywhere."No big Chief," grunted Crowfoot in disgust."One big Chief make
all Indians one."It seemed worth while to Cameron to take a full hour from his precious
time to describe fully the operations of the troops and to make clear
to the old warrior the steady advances which the various columns were
making, the points they had relieved and the ultimate certainty of
victory."Six thousand men now in the West," he concluded, "besides the Police.Old Crowfoot was evidently much impressed and was eager to learn more."I must go now," said Cameron, rising.he
asked, suddenly facing Crowfoot.Running Stream he go hunt--t'ree day--not come back," answered
Crowfoot quickly.Cameron sat down again by the fire, poked up the embers till the blaze
mounted high."Crowfoot," he said solemnly, "this day Onawata was in this camp and
spoke with you.he said, putting up his hand as the old Chief
was about to speak."This evening he rode away with Running Stream, Red
Crow, Trotting Wolf.The Sioux for many days has been leading about your
young men like dogs on a string.To-day he has put the string round the
necks of Red Crow, Running Stream, Trotting Wolf.I did not think he
could lead Crowfoot too like a little dog.he said again as Crowfoot rose to his feet in indignation.And the Police will take the
Chiefs that he led round like little dogs and send them away.The Great
Mother cannot have men as Chiefs whom she cannot trust.For many years
the Police have protected the Indians.It was Crowfoot himself who once
said when the treaty was being made--Crowfoot will remember--'If the
Police had not come to the country where would we all be now?Bad men
and whisky were killing us so fast that very few indeed of us would have
been left to-day.The Police have protected us as the feathers of the
bird protect it from the frosts of winter.'This is what Crowfoot said
to the Great Mother's Councilor when he made a treaty with the Great
Mother."Here Cameron rose to his feet and stood facing the Chief.Does he give his hand and draw it back again?It is not good that, when trouble comes, the Indians should join the
enemies of the Police and of the Great Mother across the sea.These
enemies will be scattered like dust before the wind.Does Crowfoot think
when the leaves have fallen from the trees this year there will be any
enemies left?This Sioux dog does not know the Great Mother, nor
her soldiers, nor her Police.Why does he talk to the
enemies of the Great Mother and of his friends the Police?I go to-night to take Onawata.Already my men are upon his
trail.With Onawata and the little Chiefs
he leads around or with the Great Mother and the Police?For some moments while Cameron was
speaking he had been eagerly seeking an opportunity to reply, but
Cameron's passionate torrent of words prevented him breaking in without
discourtesy.When Cameron ceased, however, the old Chief stretched out
his hand and in his own language began:

"Many years ago the Police came to this country.My people then were
poor--"

At this point the sound of a galloping horse was heard, mingled with the
loud cries of its rider.Crowfoot paused and stood intently listening.Cameron could get no meaning from the shouting.From every tent men came
running forth and from the houses along the trail on every hand, till
before the horse had gained Crowfoot's presence there had gathered about
the Chief's fire a considerable crowd of Indians, whose numbers were
momentarily augmented by men from the tents and houses up and down the
trail.In calm and dignified silence the old Chief waited the rider's word.He
was an Indian runner and he bore an important message.Dismounting, the runner stood, struggling to recover his breath and to
regain sufficient calmness to deliver his message in proper form to the
great Chief of the Blackfeet confederacy.While he stood thus struggling
with himself Cameron took the opportunity to closely scrutinize his
face."I remember him--an impudent cur."He moved
quietly toward his horse, drew the reins up over his head, and, leading
him back toward the fire, took his place beside Crowfoot again.The Sarcee had begun his tale, speaking under intense excitement which
he vainly tried to control.Such was the
rapidity and incoherence of his speech, however, that Cameron could make
nothing of it.The effect upon the crowd was immediate and astounding.On every side rose wild cries of fierce exultation, while at Cameron
angry looks flashed from every eye.Old Crowfoot alone remained quiet,
calm, impassive, except for the fierce gleaming of his steady eyes.When the runner had delivered his message he held up his hand and
spoke but a single word.Immediately there was silence as of the grave.Nothing was heard, not even the breathing of the Indians close about
him.In sharp, terse sentences the old Chief questioned the runner, who
replied at first eagerly, then, as the questions proceeded, with some
hesitation.Finally, with a wave of the hand Crowfoot dismissed him and
stood silently pondering for some moments.Then he turned to his people
and said with quiet and impressive dignity:

"This is a matter for the Council.Then
turning to Cameron he said in a low voice and with grave courtesy, "It
is wise that my brother should go while the trails are open.""The trails are always open to the Great Mother's Mounted Police," said
Cameron, looking the old Chief full in the eye.Crowfoot stood silent, evidently thinking deeply."It is right that my brother should know," he said at length, "what the
runner tells," and in his deep guttural voice there was a ring of pride."Good news is always welcome," said Cameron, as he coolly pulled out his
pipe and offered his pouch once more to Crowfoot, who, however, declined
to see it."The white soldiers have attacked the Indians and have been driven
back," said Crowfoot with a keen glance at Cameron's face.They went against
Oo-pee-too-korah-han-ap-ee-wee-yin and the Indians did not run away."No
words could describe the tone and attitude of exultant and haughty pride
with which the old Chief delivered this information."Crowfoot," said Cameron with deliberate emphasis, "it was Colonel Otter
and Superintendent Herchmer of the Mounted Police that went north
to Battleford.You do not know Colonel Otter, but you do know
Superintendent Herchmer.Tell me, would Superintendent Herchmer and the
Police run away?""The runner tells that the white soldiers ran away," said Crowfoot
stubbornly.Cameron's voice rang out loud and clear.Swift as a lightning flash the Sarcee sprang at Cameron, knife in hand,
crying in the Blackfeet tongue that terrible cry so long dreaded by
settlers in the Western States of America, "Death to the white man!"Without apparently moving a muscle, still holding by the mane of his
horse, Cameron met the attack with a swift and well-placed kick which
caught the Indian's right wrist and flung his knife high in the air.Following up the kick, Cameron took a single step forward and met the
murderous Sarcee with a straight left-hand blow on the jaw that landed
the Indian across the fire and deposited him kicking amid the crowd.Immediately there was a quick rush toward the white man, but the rush
halted before two little black barrels with two hard, steady, gray eyes
gleaming behind them."I hold ten dead Indians in my hands."With a single stride Crowfoot was at Cameron's side.A single sharp
stern word of command he uttered and the menacing Indians slunk back
into the shadows, but growling like angry beasts."Is it wise to anger my young men?""Is it wise," replied Cameron sternly, "to allow mad dogs to run loose?"Huh," grunted Crowfoot with a shrug of his shoulders.Then in a lower voice he added earnestly, "It would be good to take the
trail before my young men can catch their horses.""I was just going, Crowfoot," said Cameron, stooping to light his
pipe at the fire.And Cameron
cantered away with both hands low before him and guiding his broncho
with his knees, and so rode easily till safely beyond the line of the
reserve.Once out of the reserve he struck his spurs hard into his horse
and sent him onward at headlong pace toward the Militia camp.Ten minutes after his arrival at the camp every soldier was in his place
ready to strike, and so remained all night, with pickets thrown far out
listening with ears attent for the soft pad of moccasined feet.CHAPTER XX

THE LAST PATROL


It was still early morning when Cameron rode into the barrack-yard at
Fort Calgary.To the Sergeant in charge, the Superintendent of Police
having departed to Macleod, he reported the events of the preceding
night.he inquired after he had told his
tale."Well, I had the details yesterday," replied the Sergeant."Colonel
Otter and a column of some three hundred men with three guns went out
after Pound-maker.The Indians were apparently strongly posted and could
not be dislodged, and I guess our men were glad to get out of the scrape
as easily as they did."cried Cameron, more to himself than to the officer,
"what will this mean to us here?""Well, my business presses all the more," said Cameron.I suppose you cannot let
me have three or four men?There is liable to be trouble and we cannot
afford to make a mess of this thing.""Jerry came in last night asking for a man," replied the Sergeant, "but
I could not spare one.However, we will do our best and send you on the
very first men that come in.""Send on half a dozen to-morrow at the very latest," replied Cameron.He left a plan of the Ghost River Trail with the Sergeant and rode to
look up Dr.He found the doctor still in bed and wrathful at
being disturbed."I say, Cameron," he growled, "what in thunder do you mean by roaming
round this way at night and waking up Christian people out of their
sleep?""Sorry, old boy," replied Cameron, "but my business is rather
important."And then while the doctor sat and shivered in his night clothes upon the
side of the bed Cameron gave him in detail the history of the previous
evening and outlined his plan for the capture of the Sioux.Martin listened intently, noting the various points and sketching an
outline of the trail as Cameron described it."I wanted you to know, Martin, in case anything happened.For, well, you
know how it is with my wife just now.Good-by," said Cameron, pressing his hand."This
I feel is my last go with old Copperhead.""Oh, don't be alarmed," he replied lightly."I am going to get him this
time.Well, good-by, I am off.By the way, the Sergeant at the barracks has promised to send on half
a dozen men to-morrow to back me up.You might just keep him in mind of
that, for things are so pressing here that he might quite well imagine
that he could not spare the men.""Well, that is rather better," said Martin."The Sergeant will send
those men all right, or I will know the reason why.A day's ride brought Cameron to Kananaskis, where the Sun Dance Trail
ends on one side of the Bow River and the Ghost River Trail begins on
the other.There he found signs to indicate that Jerry was before him
on his way to the Manitou Rock.As Cameron was preparing to camp for
the night there came over him a strong but unaccountable presentiment
of approaching evil, an irresistible feeling that he ought to press
forward."I suppose it is the Highlander in me that is seeing visions and
dreaming dreams.I must eat, however, no matter what is going to
happen."Leaving his horse saddled, but removing the bridle, he gave him his
feed of oats, then he boiled his tea and made his own supper.As he was
eating the feeling grew more strongly upon him that he should not camp
but go forward at once.At the same time he made the discovery that the
weariness that had almost overpowered him during the last half-hour
of his ride had completely vanished.Hence, with the feeling of half
contemptuous anger at himself for yielding to his presentiment, he
packed up his kit again, bridled his horse, and rode on.The trail was indeed, as Jerry said, "no trail."It was rugged with
broken rocks and cumbered with fallen trees, and as it proceeded became
more indistinct.His horse, too, from sheer weariness, for he had
already done his full day's journey, was growing less sure footed and
so went stumbling noisily along.Cameron began to regret his folly in
yielding to a mere unreasoning imagination and he resolved to spend the
night at the first camping-ground that should offer.The light of the
long spring day was beginning to fade from the sky and in the forest the
deep shadows were beginning to gather.Still no suitable camping-ground
presented itself and Cameron stubbornly pressed forward through the
forest that grew denser and more difficult at every step.After some
hours of steady plodding the trees began to be sensibly larger, the
birch and poplar gave place to spruce and pine and the underbrush almost
entirely disappeared.The trail, too, became better, winding between
the large trees which, with clean trunks, stood wide apart and arranged
themselves in stately high-arched aisles and long corridors.From the
lofty branches overhead the gray moss hung in long streamers, as Jerry
had said, giving to the trees an ancient and weird appearance.Along
these silent, solemn, gray-festooned aisles and corridors Cameron rode
with an uncanny sensation that unseen eyes were peering out upon him
from those dim and festooned corridors on either side.Impatiently he
strove to shake off the feeling, but in vain.At length, forced by
the growing darkness, he decided to camp, when through the shadowy and
silent forest there came to his ears the welcome sound of running water.It was to Cameron like the sound of a human voice.He almost called
aloud to the running stream as to a friend.In a few minutes he had reached the water and after picketing his horse
some little distance down the stream and away from the trail, he
rolled himself in his blanket to sleep.The moon rising above the high
tree-tops filled the forest aisles with a soft unearthly light.As his
eye followed down the long dim aisles there grew once more upon him
the feeling that he was being watched by unseen eyes.Vainly he cursed
himself for his folly.He
lay still listening with every nerve taut.He fancied he could hear soft
feet about him and stealing near.With his two guns in hand he sat bolt
upright.Straight before him and not more than ten feet away the form of
an Indian was plainly to be seen.A slight sound to his right drew his
eyes in that direction.There, too, stood the silent form of an Indian,
on his left also an Indian.Suddenly from behind him a deep, guttural
voice spoke, "Look this way!"He turned sharply and found himself gazing
into a rifle-barrel a few feet from his face.He glanced to right and left, only to find rifles leveled at him
from every side."White man put down his guns on ground!""Indian speak no more," said the voice in a deep growl.Out from behind the Indian with the leveled rifle glided
another Indian form.All thought of resistance passed from Cameron's mind.It would mean
instant death, and, what to Cameron was worse than death, the certain
failure of his plans.Besides, there
would be the Police next day.With savage, cruel haste Copperhead bound his hands behind his back and
as a further precaution threw a cord about his neck.he said, giving the cord a quick jerk."Copperhead," said Cameron through his clenched teeth, "you will one day
wish you had never done this thing."said Copperhead gruffly, jerking the cord so heavily as
almost to throw Cameron off his feet.Through the night Cameron stumbled on with his captors, Copperhead in
front and the others following.Half dead with sleeplessness and blind
with rage he walked on as if in a hideous nightmare, mechanically
watching the feet of the Indian immediately in front of him and thus
saving himself many a cruel fall and a more cruel jerking of the cord
about his neck, for such was Copperhead's method of lifting him to his
feet when he fell.It seemed to him as if the night would never pass or
the journey end.At length the throbbing of the Indian drum fell upon his ears.Nothing could be much more agonizing than what he
was at present enduring.As they approached the Indian camp one of his
captors raised a wild, wailing cry which resounded through the forest
with an unearthly sound.Never had such a cry fallen upon Cameron's
ears.It was the old-time cry of the Indian warriors announcing that
they were returning in triumph bringing their captives with them.Again the cry was raised, when from the Indian
encampment came in reply a chorus of similar cries followed by a rush
of braves to meet the approaching warriors and to welcome them and their
captives.With loud and discordant exultation straight into the circle of the
firelight cast from many fires Copperhead and his companions marched
their captive.On every side naked painted Indians to the number of
several score crowded in tumultuous uproar.Not for many years had these
Indians witnessed their ancient and joyous sport of baiting a prisoner.As Cameron came into the clear light of the fire instantly low murmurs
ran round the crowd, for to many of them he was well known.His presence there was clearly a shock to many of
them.To take prisoner one of the Mounted Police and to submit him to
indignity stirred strange emotions in their hearts.The keen eye of
Copperhead noted the sudden change of the mood of the Indians and
immediately he gave orders to those who held Cameron in charge, with the
result that they hurried him off and thrust him into a little low hut
constructed of brush and open in front where, after tying his feet
securely, they left him with an Indian on guard in front.For some moments Cameron lay stupid with weariness and pain till his
weariness overpowered his pain and he sank into sleep.He was recalled
to consciousness by the sensation of something digging into his ribs.As
he sat up half asleep a low "hist!"His heart
leaped as he heard out of the darkness a whispered word, "Jerry here."Cameron rolled over and came close against the little half-breed, bound
as he was himself."Me all lak' youse'f," said Jerry.The Indian on guard was eagerly looking and listening to what was going
on before him beside the fire.At one side of the circle sat the Indians
in council.Copperhead was standing and speaking to them.said Cameron, his mouth close to Jerry's ear."He say dey keel us queeck.Say he keel us heemse'f--queeck."Again and again and with ever increasing vehemence Copperhead urged his
views upon the hesitating Indians, well aware that by involving them in
such a deed of blood he would irrevocably commit them to rebellion.But
he was dealing with men well-nigh as subtle as himself, and for the very
same reason as he pressed them to the deed they shrank back from it.They were not yet quite prepared to burn their bridges behind them.Indeed some of them suggested the wisdom of holding the prisoners as
hostages in case of necessity arising in the future."Piegan, Sarcee, Blood," breathed Jerry."No Blackfeet come--not
yet--Copperhead he look, look, look all yesterday for Blackfeet
coming.Blackfeet come to-morrow mebbe--den Indian mak' beeg medicine.Copperhead he go meet Blackfeet dis day--he catch you--he go 'gain
to-morrow mebbe--dunno."Meantime the discussion in the council was drawing to a climax.With
the astuteness of a true leader Copperhead ceased to urge his view, and,
unable to secure the best, wisely determined to content himself with the
second-best.His vehement tone gave place to one of persuasion.Finally
an agreement appeared to be reached by all.With one consent the council
rose and with hands uplifted they all appeared to take some solemn oath."He say," replied Jerry, "he go meet Blackfeet and when he bring 'em
back den dey keel us sure t'ing.But," added Jerry with a cheerful
giggle, "he not keel 'em yet, by Gar!"For some minutes they waited in silence, then they saw Copperhead with
his bodyguard of Sioux disappear from the circle of the firelight into
the shadows of the forest.Even before he had finished speaking Cameron had lain back upon the
ground and in spite of the pain in his tightly bound limbs such was his
utter exhaustion that he fell fast asleep.It seemed to him but a moment when he was again awakened by the touch
of a hand stealing over his face.The hand reached his lips and rested
there, when he started up wide-awake.A soft hiss from the back of the
hut arrested him."No noise," said a soft guttural voice.Again the hand was thrust
through the brush wall, this time bearing a knife."Cut string,"
whispered the voice, while the hand kept feeling for the thongs that
bound Cameron's hands.In a few moments Cameron was free from his bonds."Tell you squaw," said the voice, "sick boy not forget."The boy
laid his hand on Cameron's lips and was gone.Slowly they wormed their way through the flimsy
brush wall at the back, and, crouching low, looked about them.The fires were smoldering in their ashes.Lying across the front of their little hut the
sleeping form of their guard could be seen.The forest was still black
behind them, but already there was in the paling stars the faint promise
of the dawn.Hardly daring to breathe, they rose and stood looking at
each other."No stir," said Jerry with his lips at Cameron's ear.He dropped on his
hands and knees and began carefully to remove every twig from his path
so that his feet might rest only upon the deep leafy mold of the
forest.Carefully Cameron followed his example, and, working slowly and
painfully, they gained the cover of the dark forest away from the circle
of the firelight.Scarcely had they reached that shelter when an Indian rose from beside
a fire, raked the embers together, and threw some sticks upon it.As
Cameron stood watching him, his heart-beat thumping in his ears, a
rotten twig snapped under his feet.The Indian turned his face in their
direction, and, bending forward, appeared to be listening intently.Instantly Jerry, stooping down, made a scrambling noise in the leaves,
ending with a thump upon the ground.Immediately the Indian relaxed his
listening attitude, satisfied that a rabbit was scurrying through the
forest upon his own errand bent.Rigidly silent they stood, watching him
till long after he had lain down again in his place, then once more they
began their painful advance, clearing treacherous twigs from every place
where their feet should rest.Fortunately for their going the forest
here was largely free from underbrush.Working carefully and painfully
for half an hour, and avoiding the trail by the Ghost River, they made
their way out of hearing of the camp and then set off at such speed as
their path allowed, Jerry in the lead and Cameron following.inquired Cameron as the little half-breed,
without halt or hesitation, went slipping through the forest.I want to talk to you," said Cameron."All right," said Cameron, following close upon his heels.The morning broadened into day, but they made no pause till they had
left behind them the open timber and gained the cover of the forest
where the underbrush grew thick.Then Jerry, finding a dry and sheltered
spot, threw himself down and stretched himself at full length waiting
for Cameron's word."Non," replied the little man scornfully."When lie down tak' 'em easy."Copperhead is on his way to meet the Blackfeet, but
I fancy he is going to be disappointed."Then Cameron narrated to Jerry
the story of his recent interview with Crowfoot."So I don't think," he
concluded, "any Blackfeet will come.Copperhead and Running Stream are
going to be sold this time.Besides that the Police are on their way to
Kananaskis following our trail.They will reach Kananaskis to-night and
start for Ghost River to-morrow.We ought to get Copperhead between us
somewhere on the Ghost River trail and we must get him to-day.Jerry considered the matter, then, pointing straight eastward, he
replied:

"On trail Kananaskis not far from Ghost Reever.""He would have to sleep and
eat, Jerry."No sleep--hit sam' tam' he run.""Then it is quite possible," said Cameron, "that we may head him off.""Mebbe--dunno how fas' he go," said Jerry."By the way, Jerry, when do we eat?""Pull belt tight," said Jerry with a grin."Do you mean to say you had the good sense to cache some grub, Jerry, on
your way down?""Jerry lak' squirrel," replied the half-breed."Cache grub many
place--sometam come good.""Halfway Kananaskis to Ghost Reever.""Then, Jerry, we must make that Ghost River trail and make it quick if
we are to intercept Copperhead."We mus' mak' beeg speed for sure."And "make big speed" they
did, with the result that by midday they struck the trail not far from
Jerry's cache.As they approached the trail they proceeded with extreme
caution, for they knew that at any moment they might run upon Copperhead
and his band or upon some of their Indian pursuers who would assuredly
be following them hard.A careful scrutiny of the trail showed that
neither Copperhead nor their pursuers had yet passed by."Come now ver' soon," said Jerry, as he left the trail, and, plunging
into the brush, led the way with unerring precision to where he had made
his cache.Quickly they secured the food and with it made their way back
to a position from which they could command a view of the trail."Go sleep now," said Jerry, after they had done.Gladly Cameron availed himself of the opportunity to catch up his sleep,
in which he was many hours behind.He stretched himself on the ground
and in a moment's time lay as completely unconscious as if dead.But
before half of his allotted time was gone he was awakened by Jerry's
hand pressing steadily upon his arm."Indian come," whispered the half-breed.Instantly Cameron was
wide-awake and fully alert.he asked, lying with his ear to the ground.Almost as Jerry was speaking the figure of an
Indian came into view, running with that tireless trot that can wear out
any wild animal that roams the woods.whispered Cameron, tightening his belt and making as if to
rise.Following Copperhead, and running not close upon him but at some
distance behind, came another Indian, then another, till three had
passed their hiding-place."Four against two, Jerry," said Cameron.They have
their knives, I see, but only one gun.We have no guns and only one
knife.But Jerry, we can go in and kill them with our bare hands."He had fought too often against much greater
odds in Police battles to be unduly disturbed at the present odds.Silently and at a safe distance behind they fell into the wake of the
running Indians, Jerry with his moccasined feet leading the way.John moved to the garden.Mile
after mile they followed the trail, ever on the alert for the doubling
back of those whom they were pursuing.Suddenly Cameron heard a sharp
hiss from Jerry in front.Swiftly he flung himself into the brush and
lay still.Within a minute he saw coming back upon the trail an Indian,
silent as a shadow and listening at every step.The Indian passed his
hiding-place and for some minutes Cameron lay watching until he saw him
return in the same stealthy manner.After some minutes had elapsed a
soft hiss from Jerry brought Cameron cautiously out upon the trail once
more.A second time during the afternoon Jerry's warning hiss sent Cameron
into the brush to allow an Indian to scout his back trail.It was clear
that the presence of Cameron and the half-breed upon the Ghost River
trail had awakened the suspicion in Copperhead's mind that the plan to
hold a powwow at Manitou Rock was known to the Police and that they were
on his trail.It became therefore increasingly evident to Cameron that
any plan that involved the possibility of taking Copperhead unawares
would have to be abandoned."Jerry," he said, "if that Indian doubles back on his track again I mean
to get him.If we get him the other chaps will follow."Give heem to me," said Jerry eagerly.It was toward the close of the afternoon when again Jerry's hiss warned
Cameron that the Indian was returning upon his trail.Cameron stepped
into the brush at the side, and, crouching low, prepared for the
encounter, but as he was about to spring Jerry flashed past him, and,
hurling himself upon the Indian's back, gripped him by the throat and
bore him choking to earth, knocking the wind out of him and rendering
him powerless.Jerry's knife descended once bright, once red, and the
Indian with a horrible gasping cry lay still.cried Cameron, seizing the dead man by the shoulders.Jerry sprang to seize the legs, and, taking care not to break down the
brush on either side of the trail, they lifted the body into the thick
underwood and concealing themselves beside it awaited events.Hardly
were they out of sight when they heard the soft pad of several feet
running down the trail.grunted the Indian runner, and darted back by the way he had
come.With every nerve strung to its highest tension they waited, crouching,
Jerry tingling and quivering with the intensity of his excitement,
Cameron quiet, cool, as if assured of the issue."I am going to get that devil this time, Jerry," he breathed."He
dragged me by the neck once.At a little distance from them there
was a sound of creeping steps.A few moments they waited and at their
side the brush began to quiver.A moment later beside Cameron's face
a hand carrying a rifle parted the screen of spruce boughs.Quick as
a flash Cameron seized the wrist, gripping it with both hands, and,
putting his weight into the swing, flung himself backwards; at the same
time catching the body with his knee, he heaved it clear over their
heads and landed it hard against a tree.The rifle tumbled from the
Indian's hand and he lay squirming on the ground.Immediately as Jerry
sprang for the rifle a second Indian thrust his face through the screen,
caught sight of Jerry with the rifle, darted back and disappeared with
Jerry hard upon his trail.Scarcely had they vanished into the brush
when Cameron, hearing a slight sound at his back, turned swiftly to
see a tall Indian charging upon him with knife raised to strike.He had
barely time to thrust up his arm and divert the blow from his neck to
his shoulder when the Indian was upon him like a wild cat.cried Cameron with exultation, as he flung him off.The Sioux paused in his attack, looking scornfully at his antagonist.He was dressed in a highly embroidered tight-fitting deerskin coat and
leggings.he grunted in a voice of quiet, concentrated fury."No, Copperhead," replied Cameron quietly."You have a knife, I have
none, but I shall lead you like a dog into the Police guard-house."The Sioux said nothing in reply, but kept circling lightly on his toes
waiting his chance to spring.As the two men stood facing each other
there was little to choose between them in physical strength and agility
as well as in intelligent fighting qualities.There was this difference,
however, that the Indian's fighting had ever been to kill, the white
man's simply to win.But this difference to-day had ceased to exist.There was in Cameron's mind the determination to kill if need be.One
immense advantage the Indian held in that he possessed a weapon in
the use of which he was a master and by means of which he had already
inflicted a serious wound upon his enemy, a wound which as yet was but
slightly felt.Sandra moved to the kitchen.To deprive the Indian of that knife was Cameron's first
aim.That once achieved, the end could not long be delayed; for the
Indian, though a skillful wrestler, knows little of the art of fighting
with his hands.As Cameron stood on guard watching his enemy's movements, his mind
recalled in swift review the various wrongs he had suffered at his
hands, the fright and insult to his wife, the devastation of his home,
the cattle-raid involving the death of Raven, and lastly he remembered
with a deep rage his recent humiliation at the Indian's hands and how
he had been hauled along by the neck and led like a dog into the Indian
camp.At these recollections he became conscious of a burning desire to
humiliate the redskin who had dared to do these things to him.With this in mind he waited the Indian's attack.The attack came swift
as a serpent's dart, a feint to strike, a swift recoil, then like
a flash of light a hard drive with the knife.But quick as was the
Indian's drive Cameron was quicker.Catching the knife-hand at the wrist
he drew it sharply down, meeting at the same time the Indian's chin with
a short, hard uppercut that jarred his head so seriously that his grip
on the knife relaxed and it fell from his hand.Cameron kicked it behind
him into the brush while the Indian, with a mighty wrench, released
himself from Cameron's grip and sprang back free.For some time the
Indian kept away out of Cameron's reach as if uncertain of himself.I
will punish the great Sioux Chief like a little child."So saying, Cameron stepped quickly toward him, made a few passes and
once, twice, with his open hand slapped the Indian's face hard.In a mad
fury of passion the Indian rushed upon him.Cameron met him with blows,
one, two, three, the last one heavy enough to lay him on the ground
insensible.said Cameron contemptuously, kicking him as he might a
dog.Slowly the Indian rose, wiping his bleeding lips, hate burning in his
eyes, but in them also a new look, one of fear.smiled Cameron, enjoying to the full
the humiliation of his enemy.He was no coward and he was
by no means beaten as yet, but this kind of fighting was new to him.He
apparently determined to avoid those hammering fists of the white man.With extraordinary agility he kept out of Cameron's reach, circling
about him and dodging in and out among the trees.While thus pressing
hard upon the Sioux Cameron suddenly became conscious of a sensation
of weakness.The bloodletting of the knife wound was beginning to tell.Cameron began to dread that if ever this Indian made up his mind to run
away he might yet escape.He began to regret his trifling with him and
he resolved to end the fight as soon as possible with a knock-out blow.The quick eye of the Indian perceived that Cameron's breath was coming
quicker, and, still keeping carefully out of his enemy's reach, he
danced about more swiftly than ever.Cameron realized that he must bring
the matter quickly to an end.Feigning a weakness greater than he felt,
he induced the Indian to run in upon him, but this time the Indian
avoided the smashing blow with which Cameron met him, and, locking his
arms about his antagonist and gripping him by the wounded shoulder,
began steadily to wear him to the ground.Sickened by the intensity
of the pain in his wounded shoulder, Cameron felt his strength rapidly
leaving him.Gradually the Indian shifted his hand up from the shoulder
to the neck, the fingers working their way toward Cameron's face.Well
did Cameron know the savage trick which the Indian had in mind.In a
few minutes more those fingers would be in Cameron's eyes pressing the
eyeballs from their sockets.It was now the Indian's turn to jibe.The taunt served to stimulate every ounce of Cameron's remaining
strength.With a mighty effort he wrenched the Indian's hand from his
face, and, tearing himself free, swung his clenched fist with all his
weight upon the Indian's neck.The blow struck just beneath the jugular
vein.The Indian's grip relaxed, he staggered back a pace, half stunned.Summoning all his force, Cameron followed up with one straight blow upon
the chin.As if stricken by an axe the Indian
fell to the earth and lay as if dead.Sinking on the ground beside him
Cameron exerted all his will-power to keep himself from fainting.After
a few minutes' fierce struggle with himself he was sufficiently revived
to be able to bind the Indian's hands behind his back with his belt.Searching among the brushwood, he found the Indian's knife, and cut from
his leather trousers sufficient thongs to bind his legs, working with
fierce and concentrated energy while his strength lasted.At length as
the hands were drawn tight darkness fell upon his eyes and he sank down
unconscious beside his foe.He has lost a lot of blood, but we have checked
that flow and he will soon be right.We know the
old snake and we have tied him fast.Jerry has a fine assortment of
knots adorning his person.Now, no more talking for half a day.A mighty close shave it was, but by to-morrow you
will be fairly fit.Looks
as if a tree had fallen upon him."Martin's
Cameron could only make feeble answer, "For God's sake don't let him
go!"After the capture of Copperhead the camp at Manitou Lake faded away, for
when the Police Patrol under Jerry's guidance rode up the Ghost River
Trail they found only the cold ashes of camp-fires and the debris that
remains after a powwow.Three days later Cameron rode back into Fort Calgary, sore but content,
for at his stirrup and bound to his saddle-horn rode the Sioux Chief,
proud, untamed, but a prisoner.As he rode into the little town his
quick eyes flashed scorn upon all the curious gazers, but in their
depths beneath the scorn there looked forth an agony that only Cameron
saw and understood.He had played for a great stake and had lost.As the patrol rode into Fort Calgary the little town was in an uproar of
jubilation.inquired the doctor, for Cameron felt too weary to
inquire.said a young chap dressed in cow-boy
garb."Middleton has smashed the half-breeds at Batoche.Cameron threw a swift glance at the Sioux's face.A fierce anxiety
looked out of the gleaming eyes."Tell him, Jerry," said Cameron to the half-breed who rode at his other
side.As Jerry told the Indian of the total collapse of the rebellion and the
capture of its leader the stern face grew eloquent with contempt."Riel he much fool--no good
fight.The look on his face all too
clearly revealed that his soul was experiencing the bitterness of death.Cameron almost pitied him, but he spoke no word.There was nothing that
one could say and besides he was far too weary for anything but rest.Mary moved to the office.At the gate of the Barrack yard his old Superintendent from Fort Macleod
met the party.exclaimed the Superintendent, glancing in
alarm at Cameron's wan face."I have got him," replied Cameron, loosing the lariat from the horn of
his saddle and handing the end to an orderly."But," he added, "it seems
hardly worth while now."exclaimed the Superintendent with as much
excitement as he ever allowed to appear in his tone."Let me tell you,
Cameron, that if any one thing has kept me from getting into a blue funk
during these months it was the feeling that you were on patrol along the
Sun Dance Trail."But while he smiled he
looked into the cold, gray eyes of his Chief, and, noting the unwonted
glow in them, he felt that after all his work as the Patrol of the Sun
Dance Trail was perhaps worth while.CHAPTER XXI

WHY THE DOCTOR STAYED


The Big Horn River, fed by July suns burning upon glaciers high up
between the mountain-peaks, was running full to its lips and gleaming
like a broad ribbon of silver, where, after rushing hurriedly out of the
rock-ribbed foothills, it settled down into a deep steady flow through
the wide valley of its own name.On the tawny undulating hillsides,
glorious in the splendid July sun, herds of cattle and horses were
feeding, making with the tawny hillsides and the silver river a picture
of luxurious ease and quiet security that fitted well with the mood of
the two men sitting upon the shady side of the Big Horn Ranch House.Inspector Dickson was enjoying to the full his after-dinner pipe,
and with him Dr.Martin, who was engaged in judiciously pumping
the Inspector in regard to the happenings of the recent
campaign--successfully, too, except where he touched those events in
which the Inspector himself had played a part.Riel
was in his cell at Regina awaiting trial and execution.Pound-maker,
Little Pine, Big Bear and some of their other Chiefs were similarly
disposed of.Copperhead at Macleod was fretting his life out like an
eagle in a cage.The various regiments of citizen soldiers had gone back
to their homes to be received with vociferous welcome, except such of
them as were received in reverent silence, to be laid away among the
immortals with quiet falling tears.The Police were busily engaged in
wiping up the debris of the Rebellion.The Commissioner, intent upon his
duty, was riding the marches, bearing in grim silence the criticism of
empty-headed and omniscient scribblers, because, forsooth, he had
obeyed his Chief's orders, and, resisting the greatest provocation to
do otherwise, had held steadfastly to his post, guarding with resolute
courage what was committed to his trust.The Superintendents and
Inspectors were back at their various posts, settling upon the reserves
wandering bands of Indians, some of whom were just awakening to the
fact that they had missed a great opportunity and were grudgingly
surrendering to the inevitable, and, under the wise, firm, judicious
handling of the Police, were slowly returning to their pre-rebellion
status.The Western ranches were rejoicing in a sense of vast relief from the
terrible pall that like a death-cloud had been hanging over them for six
months and all Western Canada was thrilling with the expectation of a
new era of prosperity consequent upon its being discovered by the big
world outside.Cameron, carrying in her arms her
babe, bore down in magnificent and modest pride, wearing with matronly
grace her new glory of a great achievement, the greatest open to
womankind."He has just waked up from a very fine sleep," she exclaimed, "to make
your acquaintance, Inspector.I hope you duly appreciate the honor done
you."The Inspector rose to his feet and saluted the new arrival with becoming
respect.Cameron, settling herself down with an air of
determined resolve, "I want to hear all about it.""Meaning, to begin with, that famous march of yours from Calgary to the
far North land where you did so many heroic things."But the Inspector's talk had a trick of fading away at the end of
the third sentence and it was with difficulty that they could get him
started again.Cameron, giving up the
struggle.The latter turned upon the Inspector two steady blue eyes beaming with
the intelligence of a two months' experience of men and things, and
announced his grave disapproval of the Inspector's conduct in a distinct
"goo!"What have
you now to say for yourself?"The Inspector regarded the blue-eyed atom with reverent wonder."Most remarkable young person I ever saw in my life, Mrs."Well, baby, he IS provoking, but we will forgive him since he is so
clever at discovering your remarkable qualities."Martin," explained the mother with affectionate emphasis,
"what a way you have of putting things."He promised faithfully to be home before
dinner."She rose, and, going to the side of the house, looked long and
anxiously up toward the foothills.Martin followed her and stood at
her side gazing in the same direction."I never tire of looking over
the hills and up to the great mountains.""What the deuce is the fellow doing?"exclaimed the doctor, disgust and
rage mingling in his tone.she cried, her eyes following the
doctor's and lighting upon two figures that stood at the side of the
poplar bluff in an attitude sufficiently compromising to justify the
doctor's exclamation.It's Moira--and--and--it's Smith!The
doctor's language appeared unequal to his emotions.he cried,
after an exhausting interlude of expletives.Oh, I don't
know--and I don't care.I gave her up to that other fellow who saved her life
and then picturesquely got himself killed.Raven was a fine chap and I don't mind her losing her heart to
him--but really this is too much.I don't care what kind of
legs he has.Smith is an honorable fellow and--and--so good he was to
us.Why, when Allan and the rest of you were all away he was like a
brother through all those terrible days.I can never forget his splendid
kindness--but--"

"I beg your pardon, Mrs.I am an ass, a jealous ass--might as well own it.But,
really, I cannot quite stand seeing her throw herself at Smith--Smith!Oh, I know, I know, he is all right.But oh--well--at any rate thank
God I saw him at it.It will keep me from openly and uselessly abasing
myself to her and making a fool of myself generally.Martin," at length she groaned tearfully, "I am
so disappointed.I was so hoping, and I was sure it was all
right--and--and--oh, what does it mean?Martin, I cannot tell
you how I feel."A little
surgical operation in the region of the pericardium is all, that is
required."Cameron, vaguely listening
to him and busy with her own thoughts the while.I am talking about that organ,
the central organ of the vascular system of animals, a hollow muscular
structure that propels the blood by alternate contractions and
dilatations, which in the mammalian embryo first appears as two tubes
lying under the head and immediately behind the first visceral arches,
but gradually moves back and becomes lodged in the thorax."Cameron, waking up as from a dream."I am going, and I am going to leave this country," said the doctor.I have thought of it for
some time, and now I will go.""Well, you must wait at least till Allan returns.You must say good-by
to him."She followed the doctor anxiously back to his seat beside the
Inspector."Here," she cried, "hold baby a minute.There are some things
I must attend to.I would give him to the Inspector, but he would not
know how to handle him.""But I tell you I must get home," said the doctor in helpless wrath.You are not holding him
properly.Mean
advantage to take of the young person."The doctor glowered at the Inspector and set himself with ready skill to
remedy the wrong he had wrought in the young person's disposition while
the mother, busying herself ostentatiously with her domestic duties,
finally disappeared around the house, making for the bluff.As soon as
she was out of earshot she raised her voice in song."I must give the fools warning, I suppose," she said to herself.In the
pauses of her singing, "Oh, what does she mean?Well, Smith is all right, but--oh, I
must talk to her.And yet, I am so angry--yes, I am disgusted.I was
so sure that everything was all right.Ah, there she is at last,
and--well--thank goodness he is gone."Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!""Now, I must keep my temper," she added
to herself.Oh-h-h-h-O, Moira!""Oh-h-h-h-O!"I am so sorry I forgot all about the tea.""So I should suppose," snapped Mandy crossly."I saw you were too deeply
engaged to think."exclaimed the girl, a startled dismay in her face."Yes, and I would suggest that you select a less conspicuous stage for
your next scene.If it had been Raven,
Moira, I could have stood it."Her voice was hushed and
there was a look of pain in her eyes."Oh, there is nothing wrong with Smith," replied her sister-in-law
crossly, "but--well--kissing him, you know."I did not--"

"It looked to me uncommonly like it at any rate," said Mandy."You
surely don't deny that you were kissing him?"I mean, it was Smith--perhaps--yes, I think Smith did--"

"Well, it was a silly thing to do.""That's just it," said Mandy indignantly."Well, that is my affair," said Moira in an angry tone, and with a high
head and lofty air she appeared in the doctor's presence.Martin was apparently oblivious of both her lofty air and the
angle of her chin.He was struggling to suppress from observation a
tumult of mingled passions of jealousy, rage and humiliation.That this
girl whom for four years he had loved with the full strength of his
intense nature should have given herself to another was grief enough;
but the fact that this other should have been a man of Smith's caliber
seemed to add insult to his grief.He felt that not only had she
humiliated him but herself as well."If she is the kind of girl that enjoys kissing Smith I don't want her,"
he said to himself savagely, and then cursed himself that he knew it was
a lie.For no matter how she should affront him or humiliate herself
he well knew he should take her gladly on his bended knees from Smith's
hands.The cure somehow was not working, but he would allow no one to
suspect it.His voice was even and his manner cheerful as ever.Cameron, who held the key to his heart, suspected the agony through
which he was passing during the tea-hour.And it was to secure respite
for him that the tea was hurried and the doctor packed off to saddle
Pepper and round up the cows for the milking.Pepper was by birth and breeding a cow-horse, and once set upon a trail
after a bunch of cows he could be trusted to round them up with little
or no aid from his rider.Hence once astride Pepper and Pepper with his
nose pointed toward the ranging cows, the doctor could allow his heart
to roam at will.And like a homing pigeon, his heart, after some faint
struggles in the grip of its owner's will, made swift flight toward the
far-away Highland glen across the sea, the Cuagh Oir.With deliberate purpose he set himself to live again the tender and
ineffaceable memories of that eventful visit to the glen when first his
eyes were filled with the vision of the girl with the sunny hair and the
sunny eyes who that day seemed to fill the very glen and ever since that
day his heart with glory.With deliberate purpose, too, he set himself to recall the glen itself,
its lights and shadows, its purple hilltops, its emerald loch far down
at the bottom, the little clachan on the hillside and up above it the
old manor-house.But ever and again his heart would pause to catch anew
some flitting glance of the brown eyes, some turn of the golden head,
some cadence of the soft Highland voice, some fitful illusive sweetness
of the smile upon the curving lips, pause and return upon its tracks to
feel anew that subtle rapture of the first poignant thrill, lingering
over each separate memory as a drunkard lingers regretful over his last
sweet drops of wine.Meantime Pepper's intelligent diligence had sent every cow home to its
milking, and so, making his way by a short cut that led along the Big
Horn River and round the poplar bluff, the doctor, suddenly waking from
his dream of the past, faced with a fresh and sharper stab the reality
of the present.The suddenness and sharpness of the pain made him pull
his horse up short."I'll cut this country and go East," he said aloud, coming to a
conclusive decision upon a plan long considered, "I'll go in for
specializing.He sat his horse looking eastward over the hills that rolled far away to
the horizon.His eye wandered down the river gleaming now like gold in
the sunset glow.He had learned to love this land of great sunlit spaces
and fresh blowing winds, but this evening its very beauty appeared
intolerable to him.Ever since the death of Raven upon that tragic
night of the cattle-raid he had been fighting his bitter loss and
disappointment; with indifferent success, it is true, but still not
without the hope of attaining final peace of soul.This evening he knew
that, while he lived in this land, peace would never come to him, for
his heart-wound never would heal."I will say good-by to-night.Pepper woke up to some purpose and at a smart canter carried the doctor
on his way round the bluff toward a gate that opened into a lane leading
to the stables.At the gate a figure started up suddenly from the shadow
of a poplar.With a snort and in the midst of his stride Pepper swung on
his heels with such amazing abruptness that his rider was flung from his
saddle, fortunately upon his feet."Confound you for a dumb-headed fool!he
cried in a sudden rage, recognizing Smith, who stood beside the trail in
an abjectly apologetic attitude."Yes," cried another voice from the shadow.You would
think he ought to know Mr.The doctor stood speechless, surprise, disgust and rage struggling for
supremacy among his emotions.He stood gazing stupidly from one to the
other, utterly at a loss for words.Smith," began Moira somewhat lamely, "had something to say
to me and so we--and so we came--along to the gate.""So I see," replied the doctor gruffly.Smith has come to mean a great deal to me--to us--"

"So I should imagine," replied the doctor."His self-sacrifice and courage during those terrible days we can never
forget.""Exactly so--quite right," replied the doctor, standing stiffly beside
his horse's head."You do not know people all at once," continued Moira."But in times of danger and trouble one gets to know them quickly.""And it takes times of danger to bring out the hero in a man.""I should imagine so," replied the doctor with his eyes on Smith's
childlike and beaming face.Smith was really our whole stay, and--and--we came
to rely upon him and we found him so steadfast."In the face of the
doctor's stolid brevity Moira was finding conversation difficult."Exactly so," his eyes upon Smith's
wobbly legs.I congratulate
him on--"

"Oh, have you heard?I did not know that--"

"Yes.Yes--that is, for him," replied the doctor without emotion."I congratulate--"

"But how did you hear?""I did not exactly hear, but I had no difficulty in--ah--making the
discovery."It was fairly plain; I might say it was the feature of
the view; in fact it stuck right out of the landscape--hit you in the
eye, so to speak."Simply that I am at a loss as to whether Mr.Smith is to be
congratulated more upon his exquisite taste or upon his extraordinary
good fortune.""Good fortune, yes, is it not splendid?""Splendid is the exact word," said the doctor stiffly."Yes, you certainly look happy," replied the doctor with a grim attempt
at a smile, and feeling as if more enthusiasm were demanded from him."Let me offer you my congratulations and say good-by.I have thought of it for some time; indeed, I
have made my plans."But you never hinted such
a thing to--to any of us.""Oh, well, I don't tell my plans to all the world," said the doctor with
a careless laugh.The girl shrank from him as if he had cut her with his riding whip.But,
swiftly recovering herself, she cried with gay reproach:

"Why, Mr.Smith, we are losing all our friends at once.Smith, you
know," she continued, turning to the doctor with an air of exaggerated
vivacity, "leaves for the East to-night too.""Yes, you know he has come into a big fortune and is going to be--"

"A fortune?""Yes, and he is going East to be married.""Yes, and I was--"

"Going EAST?"I thought
you--"

"Oh, yes, his young lady is awaiting him in the East.And he is going to
spend his money in such a splendid way."echoed the doctor, as if he could not fix the idea with
sufficient firmness in his brain to grasp it fully."Yes, I have just told you so," replied the girl.shouted the doctor, suddenly rushing at Smith and gripping
him by both arms."Smith, you shy dog--you lucky dog!Let me wish you
joy, old man.You deserve your luck, every bit of it.Smith, you are a good one and a sly
one.What a sell--I mean what a
joke!Look here, Smith, old chap, would you mind taking Pepper home?I am rather tired--riding, I mean--beastly wild cows--no end of a run
after them.No, no, don't wait, don't
mind me.I am all right, fit as a fiddle--no, not a bit tired--I mean I
am tired riding.Yes, rather stiff--about the knees, you know.Up you get, old man--there you are!So, Smith, you are going
to be married, eh?Tell 'em I am--tell 'em we are coming.Oh, well, never mind my horse till I come myself.Say, let's
sit down, Moira," he said, suddenly growing quiet and turning to the
girl, "till I get my wind.Legs a bit wobbly, but
don't care if he had a hundred of 'em and all wobbly.What an adjectival, hyphenated jackass!Don't
look at me that way or I shall climb a tree and yell.I'm not mad, I
assure you.I was on the verge of it a few moments ago, but it is gone.I am sane, sane as an old maid.He covered his face with
his hands and sat utterly still for some moments."Why, Moira, I thought you were going to marry that idiot."I am
not going to marry him, Dr.Martin, but he is an honorable fellow and a
friend of mine, a dear friend of mine.""So he is, so he is, a splendid fellow, the finest ever, but thank God
you are not going to marry him!""Why, what is wrong with--"

"Why?Only because, Moira, I love you."He threw
himself upon his knees beside her."Don't, don't for God's sake get
away!Ever since that minute when I saw you in the glen I have loved you.In
my thoughts by day and in my dreams by night you have been, and this day
when I thought I had lost you I knew that I loved you ten thousand times
more than ever."He was kissing her hand passionately, while she sat
with head turned away."Tell me, Moira, if I may love you?And do you think you could love me even a little bit?He waited a few
moments, his face growing gray."Tell me," he said at length in a
broken, husky voice.he cried, putting his arms around her and drawing her to
him, "tell me to stay.""Stay," she whispered, "or take me too."The sun had long since disappeared behind the big purple mountains
and even the warm afterglow in the eastern sky had faded into a pearly
opalescent gray when the two reached the edge of the bluff nearest the
house.cried Moira aghast, as she came in sight of the
house.I was going to help," exclaimed the doctor."Too bad," said the girl penitently."But, of course, there's Smith."Let us go in
and face the music."They found an excited group standing in the kitchen, Mandy with a letter
in her hand."Where have you--" She glanced at
Moira's face and then at the doctor's and stopped abruptly."We have got a letter--such a letter!"The doctor cleared
his throat, struck an attitude, and read aloud:


"My dear Cameron:

"It gives me great pleasure to say for the officers of the Police Force
in the South West district and for myself that we greatly appreciate the
distinguished services you rendered during the past six months in your
patrol of the Sun Dance Trail.It was a work of difficulty and danger
and one of the highest importance to the country.I feel sure it will
gratify you to know that the attention of the Government has been
specially called to the creditable manner in which you have performed
your duty, and I have no doubt that the Government will suitably express
its appreciation of your services in due time.But, as you are aware,
in the Force to which we have the honor to belong, we do not look for
recognition, preferring to find a sufficient reward in duty done."Permit me also to say that we recognize and appreciate the spirit
of devotion showed by Mrs.Cameron during these trying months in so
cheerfully and loyally giving you up to this service."May I add that in this rebellion to my mind the most critical factor
was the attitude of the great Blackfeet Confederacy.Every possible
effort was made by the half-breeds and Northern Indians to seduce
Crowfoot and his people from their loyalty, and their most able and
unscrupulous agent in this attempt was the Sioux Indian known among
us as The Copperhead.That he failed utterly in his schemes and that
Crowfoot remained loyal I believe is due to the splendid work of the
officers and members of our Force in the South West district, but
especially to your splendid services as the Patrol of the Sun Dance
Trail.""And signed by the big Chief himself, the Commissioner," cried Dr."What do you think of that, Baby?"he continued, catching the
baby from its mother's arms.The
doctor pirouetted round the room with the baby in his arms, that
young person regarding the whole performance apparently with grave and
profound satisfaction."Your horse is ready," said Smith, coming in at the door."Oh--I forgot," said the doctor."Ah--I don't think I want him to-night,
Smith.""You are not going to-night, then?"inquired Mandy in delighted
surprise."No--I--in fact, I believe I have changed my mind about that.I have,
been--ah--persuaded to remain.""Oh, I see," cried Mandy in supreme delight.Then turning swiftly upon
her sister-in-law who stood beside the doctor, her face in a radiant
glow, she added, "Then what did you mean by--by--what we saw this
afternoon?""Going to be married, you know," interjected the doctor."And so--so--"

"Just so," cried the doctor."Smith's all right, I say,
and so are we, eh, Moira?"He slipped his arm round the blushing girl."Oh, I am so glad," cried Mandy, beaming upon them."And you are not
going East after all?"I am going to stay right in it--with the
Inspector here--and with you, Mrs.Cameron--and with my sweetheart--and
yes, certainly with the Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail."Symptoms of anxiety now began to manifest themselves amongst the
shareholders, several of whom went down to the main road to see if
Philpot was yet in sight, but each returned with the same report--they
could see nothing of him.No one was formally 'in charge' of the job during Crass's absence, but
they all returned to their work promptly at one because they feared
that Sawkins or some other sneak might report any irregularity to Crass
or Misery.At a quarter-past one, Philpot was still missing and the uneasiness of
the shareholders began to develop into a panic.Some of them plainly
expressed the opinion that he had gone on the razzle with the money.As
the time wore on, this became the general opinion.At two o'clock, all
hope of his return having been abandoned, two or three of the
shareholders went and drank some of the cold tea.Their fears were only too well founded, for they saw no more of Philpot
till the next morning, when he arrived looking very sheepish and
repentant and promised to refund all the money on Saturday.He also
made a long, rambling statement from which it appeared that on his way
to the 'Cricketers' he met a couple of chaps whom he knew who were out
of work, and he invited them to come and have a drink.When they got
to the pub, they found there the Semi-drunk and the Besotted Wretch.One drink led to another, and then they started arguing, and he had
forgotten all about the gallon of beer until he woke up this morning.Whilst Philpot was making this explanation they were putting on their
aprons and blouses, and Crass was serving out the lots of colour.Slyme
took no part in the conversation, but got ready as quickly as possible
and went outside to make a start.The reason for this haste soon
became apparent to some of the others, for they noticed that he had
selected and commenced painting a large window that was so situated as
to be sheltered from the keen wind that was blowing.The basement of the house was slightly below the level of the ground
and there was a sort of a trench or area about three feet deep in front
of the basement windows.Daniel moved to the office.The banks of this trench were covered with
rose trees and evergreens, and the bottom was a mass of slimy,
evil-smelling, rain-sodden earth, foul with the excrement of nocturnal
animals.To second-coat these basement windows, Philpot and Harlow had
to get down into and stand in all this filth, which soaked through the
worn and broken soles of their boots.As they worked, the thorns of
the rose trees caught and tore their clothing and lacerated the flesh
of their half-frozen hands.Owen and Easton were working on ladders doing the windows immediately
above Philpot and Harlow, Sawkins, on another ladder, was painting one
of the gables, and the other men were working at different parts of the
outside of the house.The boy Bert was painting the iron railings of
the front fence.The weather was bitterly cold, the sun was concealed
by the dreary expanse of grey cloud that covered the wintry sky.As they stood there working most of the time they were almost perfectly
motionless, the only part of their bodies that were exercised being
their right arms.The work they were now doing required to be done
very carefully and deliberately, otherwise the glass would be'messed
up' or the white paint of the frames would 'run into' the dark green of
the sashes, both colours being wet at the same time, each man having
two pots of paint and two sets of brushes.The wind was not blowing in
sudden gusts, but swept by in a strong, persistent current that
penetrated their clothing and left them trembling and numb with cold.It blew from the right; and it was all the worse on that account,
because the right arm, being in use, left that side of the body fully
exposed.They were able to keep their left hands in their trousers
pockets and the left arm close to the side most of the time.Another reason why it is worse when the wind strikes upon one from the
right side is that the buttons on a man's coat are always on the right
side, and consequently the wind gets underneath.Philpot realized this
all the more because some of the buttons on his coat and waistcoat were
missing.As they worked on, trembling with cold, and with their teeth
chattering, their faces and hands became of that pale violet colour
generally seen on the lips of a corpse.Their eyes became full of
water and the lids were red and inflamed.Philpot's and Harlow's boots
were soon wet through, with the water they absorbed from the damp
ground, and their feet were sore and intensely painful with cold.Their hands, of course, suffered the most, becoming so numbed that they
were unable to feel the brushes they held; in fact, presently, as
Philpot was taking a dip of colour, the brush fell from his hand into
the pot; and then, finding that he was unable to move his fingers, he
put his hand into his trousers pocket to thaw, and began to walk about,
stamping his feet upon the ground.His example was quickly followed by
Owen, Easton and Harlow, and they all went round the corner to the
sheltered side of the house where Slyme was working, and began walking
up and down, rubbing their hands, stamping their feet and swinging
their arms to warm themselves.'If I thought Nimrod wasn't comin', I'd put my overcoat on and work in
it,' remarked Philpot, 'but you never knows when to expect the b--r,
and if 'e saw me in it, it would mean the bloody push.''It wouldn't interfere with our workin' if we did wear 'em,' said
Easton; 'in fact, we'd be able to work all the quicker if we wasn't so
cold.''Even if Misery didn't come, I suppose Crass would 'ave something to
say if we did put 'em on,' continued Philpot.'Well, yer couldn't blame 'im if 'e did say something, could yer?''Crass would get into a row 'imself if 'Unter came
and saw us workin' in overcoats.Slyme suffered less from the cold than any of them, not only because he
had secured the most sheltered window, but also because he was better
clothed than most of the rest.'What's Crass supposed to be doin' inside?'asked Easton as he tramped
up and down, with his shoulders hunched up and his hands thrust deep
into the pockets of his trousers.'Blowed if I know,' replied Philpot.'Messin' about touchin' up or
makin' colour.He never does 'is share of a job like this; 'e knows
'ow to work things all right for 'isself.'We'd be the same if we was in 'is place, and so
would anybody else,' said Slyme, and added sarcastically: 'Or p'haps
you'd give all the soft jobs to other people and do all the rough
yerself!'Slyme knew that, although they were speaking of Crass, they were also
alluding to himself, and as he replied to Philpot he looked slyly at
Owen, who had so far taken no part in the conversation.'It's not a question of what we would do,' chimed in Harlow.'It's a
question of what's fair.If it's not fair for Crass to pick all the
soft jobs for 'imself and leave all the rough for others, the fact that
we might do the same if we 'ad the chance don't make it right.''No one can be blamed for doing the best he can for himself under
existing circumstances,' said Owen in reply to Slyme's questioning
look.That is the principle of the present system--every man for
himself and the devil take the rest.For my own part I don't pretend
to practise unselfishness.I don't pretend to guide my actions by the
rules laid down in the Sermon on the Mount.But it's certainly
surprising to hear you who profess to be a follower of
Christ--advocating selfishness.Or, rather, it would be surprising if
it were not that the name of "Christian" has ceased to signify one who
follows Christ, and has come to mean only liar and hypocrite.'Possibly the fact that he was a true believer
enabled him to bear this insult with meekness and humility.growled Easton as they returned to work.Only two more hours, but to these miserable, half-starved, ill-clad
wretches, standing here in the bitter wind that pierced their clothing
and seemed to be tearing at their very hearts and lungs with icy
fingers, it appeared like an eternity.To judge by the eagerness with
which they longed for dinner-time, one might have thought they had some
glorious banquet to look forward to instead of bread and cheese and
onions, or bloaters--and stewed tea.Two more hours of torture before dinner; and three more hours after
that.And then, thank God, it would be too dark to see to work any
longer.It would have been much better for them if, instead of being 'Freemen',
they had been slaves, and the property, instead of the hirelings, of Mr
Rushton.As it was, HE would not have cared if one or all of them had
become ill or died from the effects of exposure.It would have made no
difference to him.There were plenty of others out of work and on the
verge of starvation who would be very glad to take their places.But
if they had been Rushton's property, such work as this would have been
deferred until it could be done without danger to the health and lives
of the slaves; or at any rate, even if it were proceeded with during
such weather, their owner would have seen to it that they were properly
clothed and fed; he would have taken as much care of them as he would
of his horse.If they were to
overwork a horse and make it ill, it would cost something for medicine
and the veterinary surgeon, to say nothing of the animal's board and
lodging.If they were to work their horses to death, they would have
to buy others.But none of these considerations applies to workmen.If
they work a man to death they can get another for nothing at the corner
of the next street.They don't have to buy him; all they have to do is
to give him enough money to provide him with food and clothing--of a
kind--while he is working for them.If they only make him ill, they
will not have to feed him or provide him with medical care while he is
laid up.He will either go without these things or pay for them
himself.At the same time it must be admitted that the workman scores
over both the horse and the slave, inasmuch as he enjoys the priceless
blessing of Freedom.If he does not like the hirer's conditions he
need not accept them.He can refuse to work, and he can go and starve.He is the Heir of all
the Ages.He has the right to choose
freely which he will do--Submit or Starve.The sky, which at first had shown
small patches of blue through rifts in the masses of clouds, had now
become uniformly grey.There was every indication of an impending fall
of snow.If it did commence
to snow, they would not be able to continue this work, and therefore
they found themselves involuntarily wishing that it would snow, or
rain, or hail, or anything that would stop the work.But on the other
hand, if the weather prevented them getting on with the outside, some
of them would have to'stand off', because the inside was practically
finished.None of them wished to lose any time if they could possibly
help it, because there were only ten days more before Christmas.The morning slowly wore away and the snow did not fall.The hands
worked on in silence, for they were in no mood for talking, and not
only that, but they were afraid that Hunter or Rushton or Crass might
be watching them from behind some bush or tree, or through some of the
windows.This dread possessed them to such an extent that most of them
were almost afraid even to look round, and kept steadily on at work.None of them wished to spoil his chance of being kept on to help to do
the other house that it was reported Rushton & Co.were going to 'do
up' for Mr Sweater.Twelve o'clock came at last, and Crass's whistle had scarcely ceased to
sound before they all assembled in the kitchen before the roaring fire.Sweater had sent in two tons of coal and had given orders that fires
were to be lit every day in nearly every room to make the house
habitable by Christmas.'I wonder if it's true as the firm's got another job to do for old
Sweater?'remarked Harlow as he was toasting a bloater on the end of
the pointed stick.said the man on the pail scornfully.You
know that empty 'ouse as they said Sweater 'ad bought--the one that
Rushton and Nimrod was seen lookin' at?''Well, they wasn't pricing it up after all!The landlord of that 'ouse
is abroad, and there was some plants in the garden as Rushton thought
'e'd like, and 'e was tellin' Misery which ones 'e wanted.And
afterwards old Pontius Pilate came up with Ned Dawson and a truck.They
made two or three journeys and took bloody near everything in the
garden as was worth takin'.What didn't go to Rushton's place went to
'Unter's.'The disappointment of their hopes for another job was almost forgotten
in their interest in this story.Ned Dawson, usually called 'Bundy's mate', had been away from the house
for a few days down at the yard doing odd jobs, and had only come back
to the 'Cave' that morning.On being appealed to, he corroborated Dick
Wantley's statement.'They'll be gettin' theirselves into trouble if they ain't careful,'
remarked Easton.'Oh, no they won't, Rushton's too artful for that.It seems the agent
is a pal of 'is, and they worked it between 'em.''Oh, that's nothing to some of the things I've known 'em do before
now,' said the man on the pail.'Why, don't you remember, back in the
summer, that carved hoak hall table as Rushton pinched out of that
'ouse on Grand Parade?''Yes; that was a bit of all right too, wasn't it?'cried Philpot, and
several of the others laughed.'You know, that big 'ouse we did up last summer--No.596,' Wantley
continued, for the benefit of those not 'in the know'.'Well, it 'ad
bin empty for a long time and we found this 'ere table in a cupboard
under the stairs.One of them bracket
tables what you fix to the wall, without no legs.It 'ad a 'arf-round
marble top to it, and underneath was a carved hoak figger, a mermaid,
with 'er arms up over 'er 'ead 'oldin' up the table top--something
splendid!'The man on the pail waxed enthusiastic as he thought of it.'Must 'ave been worth at least five quid.Well, just as we pulled this
'ere table out, who should come in but Rushton, and when 'e seen it, 'e
tells Crass to cover it over with a sack and not to let nobody see it.And then 'e clears orf to the shop and sends the boy down with the
truck and 'as it took up to 'is own 'ouse, and it's there now, fixed in
the front 'all.I was sent up there a couple of months ago to paint
and varnish the lobby doors and I seen it meself.There's a pitcher
called "The Day of Judgement" 'angin' on the wall just over it--thunder
and lightning and earthquakes and corpses gettin' up out o' their
graves--something bloody 'orrible!And underneath the picture is a card
with a tex out of the Bible--"Christ is the 'ead of this 'ouse: the
unknown guest at every meal.The silent listener to every
conversation."I was workin' there for three or four days and I got to
know it orf by 'eart.''Well, that takes the biskit, don't it?''Yes: but the best of it was,' the man on the pail proceeded, 'the best
of it was, when ole Misery 'eard about the table, 'e was so bloody wild
because 'e didn't get it 'imself that 'e went upstairs and pinched one
of the venetian blinds and 'ad it took up to 'is own 'ouse by the boy,
and a few days arterwards one of the carpenters 'ad to go and fix it up
in 'is bedroom.''Well, there was a bit of talk about it.The agent wanted to know
where it was, but Pontius Pilate swore black and white as there 'adn't
been no blind in that room, and the end of it was that the firm got the
order to supply a new one.''What I can't understand is, who did the table belong to?''It was a fixture belongin' to the 'ouse,' replied Wantley.'But I
suppose the former tenants had some piece of furniture of their own
that they wanted to put in the 'all where this table was fixed, so they
took it down and stored it away in this 'ere cupboard, and when they
left the 'ouse I suppose they didn't trouble to put it back again.Anyway, there was the mark on the wall where it used to be fixed, but
when we did the staircase down, the place was papered over, and I
suppose the landlord or the agent never give the table a thought.Anyhow, Rushton got away with it all right.'A number of similar stories were related by several others concerning
the doings of different employers they had worked for, but after a time
the conversation reverted to the subject that was uppermost in their
thoughts--the impending slaughter, and the improbability of being able
to obtain another job, considering the large number of men who were
already out of employment.'I can't make it out, myself,' remarked Easton.'Things seems to get
worse every year.There don't seem to be 'arf the work about that
there used to be, and even what there is is messed up anyhow, as if the
people who 'as it done can't afford to pay for it.''Yes,' said Harlow; 'that's true enough.Why, just look at the work
that's in one o' them 'ouses on the Grand Parade.People must 'ave 'ad
more money to spend in those days, you know; all those massive curtain
cornishes over the drawing- and dining-room winders--gilded solid!Why, nowadays they'd want all the bloody 'ouse done down right
through--inside and out, for the money it cost to gild one of them.''It seems that nearly everybody is more or less 'ard up nowadays,' said
Philpot.'I'm jiggered if I can understand it, but there it is.''You should ast Owen to explain it to yer,' remarked Crass with a
jeering laugh.''E knows all about wot's the cause of poverty, but 'e
won't tell nobody.'E's been GOIN' to tell us wot it is for a long
time past, but it don't seem to come orf.'Crass had not yet had an opportunity of producing the Obscurer cutting,
and he made this remark in the hope of turning the conversation into a
channel that would enable him to do so.But Owen did not respond, and
went on reading his newspaper.'We ain't 'ad no lectures at all lately, 'ave we?'said Harlow in an
injured tone.'I think it's about time Owen explained what the real
cause of poverty is.When Philpot had finished eating his dinner he went out of the kitchen
and presently returned with a small pair of steps, which he opened and
placed in a corner of the room, with the back of the steps facing the
audience.'There's a pulpit for
yer.'cried Crass, feeling in his waistcoat pocket for
the cutting.'Tell us wot's the real cause of poverty.'''Ear, 'ear,' shouted the man on the pail.'Git up into the bloody
pulpit and give us a sermon.'As Owen made no response to the invitations, the crowd began to hoot
and groan.'Come on, man,' whispered Philpot, winking his goggle eye persuasively
at Owen.'Come on, just for a bit of turn, to pass the time away.'Owen accordingly ascended the steps--much to the secret delight of
Crass--and was immediately greeted with a round of enthusiastic
applause.'There you are, you see,' said Philpot, addressing the meeting.'It's
no use booin' and threatenin', because 'e's one of them lecturers wot
can honly be managed with kindness.If it 'adn't a bin for me, 'e
wouldn't 'ave agreed to speak at all.'Philpot having been unanimously elected chairman, proposed by Harlow
and seconded by the man on the pail, Owen commenced:

'Mr Chairman and gentlemen:

'Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it is with some degree of
hesitation that I venture to address myself to such a large,
distinguished, fashionable, and intelligent looking audience as that
which I have the honour of seeing before me on the present occasion.''One of the finest speakers I've ever 'eard!'remarked the man on the
pail in a loud whisper to the chairman, who motioned him to be silent.Owen continued:

'In some of my previous lectures I have endeavoured to convince you
that money is in itself of no value and of no real use whatever.In
this I am afraid I have been rather unsuccessful.''Not a bit of it, mate,' cried Crass, sarcastically.''Ear, 'ear,' shouted Easton.'If a bloke was to come in 'ere now and
orfer to give me a quid--I'd refuse it!''Well, whether you agree or not, the fact remains.A man might possess
so much money that, in England, he would be comparatively rich, and yet
if he went to some country where the cost of living is very high he
would find himself in a condition of poverty.Or one might conceivably
be in a place where the necessaries of life could not be bought for
money at all.Therefore it is more conducive to an intelligent
understanding of the subject if we say that to be rich consists not
necessarily in having much money, but in being able to enjoy an
abundance of the things that are made by work; and that poverty
consists not merely in being without money, but in being short of the
necessaries and comforts of life--or in other words in being short of
the Benefits of Civilization, the things that are all, without
exception, produced by work.Whether you agree or not with anything
else that I say, you will all admit that that is our condition at the
present time.We do not enjoy a full share of the benefits of
civilization--we are all in a state of more or less abject poverty.'cried Crass, and there were loud murmurs of indignant
dissent from several quarters as Owen proceeded:

'How does it happen that we are so short of the things that are made by
work?''The reason why we're short of the things that's made by work,'
interrupted Crass, mimicking Owen's manner, 'is that we ain't got the
bloody money to buy 'em.''Yes,' said the man on the pail; 'and as I said before, if all the
money in the country was shared out equal today according to Owen's
ideas--in six months' time it would be all back again in the same 'ands
as it is now, and what are you goin' to do then?'This answer came derisively from several places at the same instant,
and then they all began speaking at once, vying with each other in
ridiculing the foolishness of 'them there Socialists', whom they called
'The Sharers Out'.Barrington was almost the only one who took no part in the
conversation.He was seated in his customary place and, as usual,
silently smoking, apparently oblivious to his surroundings.'I never said anything about "sharing out all the money",' said Owen
during a lull in the storm, 'and I don't know of any Socialist who
advocates anything of the kind.Can any of you tell me the name of
someone who proposes to do so?'No one answered, as Owen repeated his inquiry, this time addressing
himself directly to Crass, who had been one of the loudest in
denouncing and ridiculing the 'Sharers Out'.Thus cornered, Crass--who
knew absolutely nothing about the subject--for a few moments looked
rather foolish.Then he began to talk in a very loud voice:

'Why, it's a well-known fact.But they take bloody good care they don't act up to it theirselves,
though.Look at them there Labour members of Parliament--a lot of
b--rs what's too bloody lazy to work for their livin'!What the bloody
'ell was they before they got there?Only workin' men, the same as you
and me!But they've got the gift o' the gab and--'

'Yes, we know all about that,' said Owen, 'but what I'm asking you is
to tell us who advocates taking all the money in the country and
sharing it out equally?''And I say that everybody knows that's what they're after!''And you know it as well as I do.'Accordin' to that idear, a bloody scavenger or a farm
labourer ought to get as much wages as you or me!''We can talk about that some other time.What I want to know at
present is--what authority have you for saying that Socialists believe
in sharing out all the money equally amongst all the people?''Well, that's what I've always understood they believed in doing,' said
Crass rather lamely.'It's a well-known fact,' said several others.'Come to think of it,' continued Crass as he drew the Obscurer cutting
from his waistcoat pocket, 'I've got a little thing 'ere that I've been
goin' to read to yer.Remarking that the print was too small for his own eyes, he passed the
slip of paper to Harlow, who read aloud as follows:

    PROVE YOUR PRINCIPLES: OR, LOOK AT BOTH SIDES

    'I wish I could open your eyes to the true misery of our
    condition: injustice, tyranny and oppression!'said a discontented
    hack to a weary-looking cob as they stood side by side in unhired
    cabs.'I'd rather have them opened to something pleasant, thank you,'
    replied the cob.If you could enter into the noble
    aspirations--' the hack began.said the cob, interrupting
    him.Why, equality, and share and share alike all
    over the world,' said the hack.What right have those sleek, pampered hunters and
    racers to their warm stables and high feed, their grooms and
    jockeys?It is really heart-sickening to think of it,' replied
    the hack.'I don't know but you may be right,' said the cob, 'and to show
    I'm in earnest, as no doubt you are, let me have half the good
    beans you have in your bag, and you shall have half the musty oats
    and chaff I have in mine.There's nothing like proving one's
    principles.''Why don't you go
and share your wages with the chaps what's out of work?''It means that if
the Editor of the Obscurer put that in his paper as an argument against
Socialism, either he is of feeble intellect himself or else he thinks
that the majority of his readers are.That isn't an argument against
Socialism--it's an argument against the hypocrites who pretend to be
Christians--the people who profess to "Love their neighbours as
themselves"--who pretend to believe in Universal Brotherhood, and that
they do not love the world or the things of the world and say that they
are merely "Pilgrims on their way to a better land".As for why I
don't do it--why should I?But
you're all "Christians"--why don't you do it?''We're not talkin' about religion,' exclaimed Crass, impatiently.I never said anything about "Sharing
Out" or "Bearing one another's burdens".I don't profess to "Give to
everyone who asks of me" or to "Give my cloak to the man who take away
my coat".I have read that Christ taught that His followers must do
all these things, but as I do not pretend to be one of His followers I
don't do them.But you believe in Christianity: why don't you do the
things that He said?'As nobody seemed to know the answer to this question, the lecturer
proceeded:

'In this matter the difference between so-called "Christians" and
Socialists is this: Christ taught the Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of Men.Those who today pretend to be Christ's followers
hypocritically profess to carry out those teachings now.They have arranged "The Battle of Life" system instead!'The Socialist--very much against his will--finds himself in the midst
of this horrible battle, and he appeals to the other combatants to
cease from fighting and to establish a system of Brotherly Love and
Mutual Helpfulness, but he does not hypocritically pretend to practise
brotherly love towards those who will not agree to his appeal, and who
compel him to fight with them for his very life.He knows that in this
battle he must either fight or go under.Therefore, in self-defiance,
he fights; but all the time he continues his appeal for the cessation
of the slaughter.He pleads for the changing of the system.He advocates
Co-operation instead of Competition: but how can he co-operate with
people who insist on competing with him?No individual can practise
co-operation by himself!Socialism can only be practised by the
Community--that is the meaning of the word.At present, the other
members of the community--the "Christians"--deride and oppose the
Socialist's appeal.'It is these pretended Christians who do not practise what they preach,
because, all the time they are singing their songs of Brotherhood and
Love, they are fighting with each other, and strangling each other and
trampling each other underfoot in their horrible "Battle of Life"!'No Socialist suggests "Sharing out" money or anything else in the
manner you say.And another thing: if you only had a little more sense
you might be able to perceive that this stock "argument" of yours is
really an argument against the present system, inasmuch as it proves
that Money is in itself of no use whatever.Supposing all the money
was shared out equally; and suppose there was enough of it for everyone
to have ten thousand pounds; and suppose they then all thought they
were rich and none of them would work.Could they eat it or drink it or wear it?It wouldn't take
them very long to find out that this wonderful money--which under the
present system is the most powerful thing in existence--is really of no
more use than so much dirt.They would speedily perish, not from lack
of money, but from lack of wealth--that is, from lack of things that
are made by work.And further, it is quite true that if all the money
were distributed equally amongst all the people tomorrow, it would all
be up in heaps again in a very short time.But that only proves that
while the present Money System remains, it will be impossible to do
away with poverty, for heaps in some places mean little or nothing in
other places.Therefore while the money system lasts we are bound to
have poverty and all the evils it brings in its train.''Oh, of course everybody's an idjit except you,' sneered Crass, who was
beginning to feel rather fogged.'I rise to a pint of order,' said Easton.'And I rise to order a pint,' cried Philpot.'Order what the bloody 'ell you like,' remarked Harlow,'so long as I
'aven't got to pay for it.''Mine's a pint of porter,' observed the man on the pail.'The pint is,' proceeded Easton, 'when does the lecturer intend to
explain to us what is the real cause of poverty.'''Ear, 'ear,' cried Harlow.'That's what I want to know, too.''And what I should like to know is, who is supposed to be givin' this
'ere lecture?''Why, Owen, of course,' replied Harlow.'Well, why don't you try to keep quiet for a few minutes and let 'im
get on with it?''The next b--r wot interrupts,' cried Philpot, rolling up his
shirt-sleeves and glaring threateningly round upon the meeting.'The
next b--r wot interrupts goes out through the bloody winder!'At this, everybody pretended to be very frightened, and edged away as
far as possible from Philpot.Easton, who was sitting next to him, got
up and crossed over to Owen's vacant seat.The man on the pail was the
only one who did not seem nervous; perhaps he felt safer because he
was, as usual, surrounded by a moat.'Poverty,' resumed the lecturer, consists in a shortage of the
necessaries of life--or rather, of the benefits of civilization.''You've said that about a 'undred times before,' snarled Crass.'I know I have; and I have no doubt I shall have to say it about five
hundred times more before you understand what it means.''Get on with the bloody lecture,' shouted the man on the pail.'Never
mind arguin' the point.''Well, keep horder, can't you?'cried Philpot, fiercely, 'and give the
man a chance.''All these things are produced in the same way,' proceeded Owen.'They
are made from the Raw materials by those who work--aided by machinery.When we inquire into the cause of the present shortage of these things,
the first question we should ask is--Are there not sufficient of the
raw materials in existence to enable us to produce enough to satisfy
the needs of all?'The answer to this question is--There are undoubtedly more than
sufficient of all the raw materials.'Insufficiency of raw material is therefore not the cause.'The next question is--Are we short of labour?Is there not a
sufficient number of people able and willing to work?'The answers to these questions are--There are plenty of people able
and willing to work, and there is plenty of machinery!'These things being so, how comes this extraordinary result?How is it
that the benefits of civilization are not produced in sufficient
quantity to satisfy the needs of all?How is it that the majority of
the people always have to go without most of the refinements, comforts,
and pleasures of life, and very often without even the bare necessaries
of existence?'Plenty of materials--Plenty of Labour--Plenty of Machinery--and,
nearly everybody going short of nearly everything!'The cause of this extraordinary state of affairs is that although we
possess the means of producing more than abundance for all, we also
have an imbecile system of managing our affairs.'The present Money System prevents us from doing the necessary work,
and consequently causes the majority of the population to go short of
the things that can be made by work.They suffer want in the midst of
the means of producing abundance.They remain idle because they are
bound and fettered with a chain of gold.'Let us examine the details of this insane, idiotic, imbecile system.'Owen now asked Philpot to pass him a piece of charred wood from under
the grate, and having obtained what he wanted, he drew upon the wall a
quadrangular figure about four feet in length and one foot deep.The
walls of the kitchen had not yet been cleaned off, so it did not matter
about disfiguring them.+------------------------------------------------------------------+

'To find out the cause of the shortage in this country of the things
that can be made by work it is first of all necessary to find out how
people spend their time.Now this square represents the whole of the
adult population of this country.There are many different classes of
people, engaged in a great number of different occupations.Some of
them are helping to produce the benefits of civilization, and some are
not.All these people help to consume these things, but when we
inquire into their occupations we shall find that although the majority
are workers, only a comparatively small number are engaged in actually
producing either the benefits of civilization or the necessaries of
life.'...Order being once more restored, the lecturer turned again to the
drawing on the wall and stretched out his hand, evidently with the
intention of making some addition to it, but instead of doing so he
paused irresolutely, and faltering, let his arm drop down again by his
side.An absolute, disconcerting silence reigned.His embarrassment and
nervousness increased.He knew that they were unwilling to hear or
talk or think about such subjects as the cause of poverty at all.They
preferred to make fun of and ridicule them.He knew they would refuse
to try to see the meaning of what he wished to say if it were at all
difficult or obscure.How was he to put it to them so that they would
HAVE to understand it whether they wished to or not.It would be easy enough to convince them if they would only take a
LITTLE trouble and try to understand, but he knew that they certainly
would not 'worry' themselves about such a subject as this; it was not
as if it were some really important matter, such as a smutty story, a
game of hooks and rings or shove-ha'penny, something concerning
football or cricket, horse-racing or the doings of some Royal personage
or aristocrat.The problem of the cause of poverty was only something that concerned
their own and their children's future welfare.Such an unimportant
matter, being undeserving of any earnest attention, must be put before
them so clearly and plainly that they would be compelled to understand
it at a glance; and it was almost impossible to do it.Observing his hesitation, some of the men began to snigger.''E seems
to 'ave got 'isself into a bit of a fog,' remarked Crass in a loud
whisper to Slyme, who laughed.The sound roused Owen, who resumed:

'All these people help to consume the things produced by labour.We
will now divide them into separate classes.Those who help to produce;
those who do nothing, those who do harm, and those who are engaged in
unnecessary work.''And,' sneered Crass, 'those who are engaged in unnecessary talk.''First we will separate those who not only do nothing, but do not even
pretend to be of any use; people who would consider themselves
disgraced if they by any chance did any useful work.This class
includes tramps, beggars, the "Aristocracy", "Society" people, great
landowners, and generally all those possessed of hereditary wealth.'As he spoke he drew a vertical line across one end of the oblong.+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

'These people do absolutely nothing except devour or enjoy the things
produced by the labours of others.'Our next division represents those who do work of a kind--"mental"
work if you like to call it so--work that benefits themselves and harms
other people.Employers--or rather Exploiters of Labour; Thieves,
Swindlers, Pickpockets; profit seeking share-holders; burglars;
Bishops; Financiers; Capitalists, and those persons humorously called
"Ministers" of religion.If you remember that the word "minister"
means "servant" you will be able to see the joke.1             2

'None of these people produce anything themselves, but by means of
cunning and scheming they contrive between them to obtain possession of
a very large portion of the things produced by the labour of others.'Number three stands for those who work for wages or salaries, doing
unnecessary work.That is, producing things or doing things
which--though useful and necessary to the Imbecile System--cannot be
described as the necessaries of life or the benefits of civilization.It comprises Commercial
Travellers, Canvassers, Insurance agents, commission agents, the great
number of Shop Assistants, the majority of clerks, workmen employed in
the construction and adornment of business premises, people occupied
with what they call "Business", which means being very busy without
producing anything.Then there is a vast army of people engaged in
designing, composing, painting or printing advertisements, things which
are for the most part of no utility whatever, the object of most
advertisements is merely to persuade people to buy from one firm rather
than from another.If you want some butter it doesn't matter whether
you buy it from Brown or Jones or Robinson.'1             2             3

During the delivery of this pert of the lecture, the audience began to
manifest symptoms of impatience and dissent.Perceiving this, Owen,
speaking very rapidly, continued:

'If you go down town, you will see half a dozen drapers' shops within a
stone's-throw of each other--often even next door to each other--all
selling the same things.Daniel went to the bathroom.You can't possibly think that all those shops
are really necessary?You know that one of them would serve the
purpose for which they are all intended--to store and serve as a centre
for the distribution of the things that are made by work.If you will
admit that five out of the six shops are not really necessary, you must
also admit that the men who built them, and the salesmen and women or
other assistants engaged in them, and the men who design and write and
print their advertisements are all doing unnecessary work; all really
wasting their time and labour, time and labour that might be employed
in helping to produce these things that we are at present short of.You must admit that none of these people are engaged in producing
either the necessaries of life or the benefits of civilization.They
buy them, and sell them, and handle them, and haggle over, them, and
display them, in the plate glass windows of "Stores" and "Emporiums"
and make profit out of them, and use them, but these people themselves
produce nothing that is necessary to life or happiness, and the things
that some of them do produce are only necessary to the present imbecile
system.''What the 'ell sort of a bloody system do you think we ought to 'ave,
then?''Yes: you're very good at finding fault,' sneered Slyme, 'but why don't
you tell us 'ow it's all going to be put right?''Well, that's not what we're talking about now, is it?''At present we're only trying to find out how it is that there is not
sufficient produced for everyone to have enough of the things that are
made by work.Although most of the people in number three work very
hard, they produce Nothing.''Even if there is more shops than what's actually necessary,' cried
Harlow, 'it all helps people to get a livin'!If half of 'em was shut
up, it would just mean that all them what works there would be out of a
job.Live and let live, I say: all these things makes work.'''Ear, 'ear,' shouted the man behind the moat.'Yes, I know it makes "work",' replied Owen, 'but we can't live on mere
"work", you know.To live in comfort we need a sufficiency of the
things that can be made by work.A man might work very hard and yet be
wasting his time if he were not producing something necessary or useful.'Why are there so many shops and stores and emporiums?Do you imagine
they exist for the purpose of giving those who build them, or work in
them, a chance to earn a living?They are carried
on, and exorbitant prices are charged for the articles they sell, to
enable the proprietors to amass fortunes, and to pay extortionate rents
to the landlords.That is why the wages and salaries of nearly all
those who do the work created by these businesses are cut down to the
lowest possible point.''We knows all about that,' said Crass, 'but you can't get away from it
that all these things makes Work; and that's what we wants--Plenty of
Work.'Cries of ''Ear, 'ear,' and expressions of dissent from the views
expressed by the lecturer resounded through the room, nearly everyone
speaking at the same time.After a while, when the row had in some
measure subsided, Owen resumed:

'Nature has not provided ready-made all the things necessary for the
life and happiness of mankind.In order to obtain these things we have
to Work.The only rational labour is that which is directed to the
creation of those things.Any kind of work which does not help us to
attain this object is a ridiculous, idiotic, criminal, imbecile, waste
of time.'That is what the great army of people represented by division number
three are doing at present: they are all very busy--working very
hard--but to all useful intents and purposes they are doing Nothing.''Well, all right,' said Harlow.''Ave it yer own way, but there's no
need to keep on repeating the same thing over an' over again.''The next division,' resumed Owen,'stands for those who are engaged in
really useful work--the production of the benefits of civilization--the
necessaries, refinements and comforts of life.'1             2             3            4

'Hooray!'shouted Philpot, leading off a cheer which was taken up
enthusiastically by the crowd, 'Hooray!This is where WE comes in,' he
added, nodding his head and winking his goggle eyes at the meeting.'I wish to call the chairman to horder,' said the man on the pail.When Owen had finished writing in the list of occupations several
members of the audience rose to point out that those engaged in the
production of beer had been omitted.Owen rectified this serious
oversight and proceeded:

'As most of the people in number four are out of work at least one
quarter of their time, we must reduce the size of this division by one
fourth--so.'But some of those in number three are often unemployed as well,' said
Harlow.Yes: but as THEY produce nothing even when they are at work we need not
trouble to classify them unemployed, because our present purpose is
only to discover the reason why there is not enough produced for
everyone to enjoy abundance; and this--the Present System of conducting
our affairs--is the reason of the shortage--the cause of poverty.When
you reflect that all the other people are devouring the things produced
by those in number four--can you wonder that there is not plenty for
all?''"Devouring" is a good word,' said Philpot, and the others laughed.The lecturer now drew a small square upon the wall below the other
drawing.1             2             3            4

    How the things produced by the people in division 4 are'shared
         out' amongst the different classes of the population.'Now you mustn't run away with the idea that the people in three and
four take their share quietly and divide the things equally between
them.Some get very little, some none, some more than a
fair share.It is in these two divisions that the ferocious "Battle of
Life" rages most fiercely; and of course in this battle the weak and
the virtuous fare the worst.Even those whose exceptional abilities or
opportunities enable them to succeed, are compelled to practise
selfishness, because a man of exceptional ability who was not selfish
would devote his abilities to relieving the manifest sufferings of
others, and not to his own profit, and if he did the former he would
not be successful in the sense that the world understands the word.All those who really seek to "Love their neighbour as themselves", or
to return good for evil, the gentle, the kind, and all those who
refrain from doing to others the things they would not like to suffer
themselves; all these are of necessity found amongst the vanquished;
because only the worst--only those who are aggressive, cunning, selfish
and mean are fitted to survive.And all these people in numbers three
and four are so fully occupied in this dreadful struggle to secure a
little, that but few of them pause to inquire why there are not more of
the things they are fighting for, or why it is necessary to fight like
this at all!'For a few minutes silence prevailed, each man's mind being busy trying
to think of some objection to the lecturer's arguments.'How could the small number of people in number one and two consume as
much as you've given 'em in your drorin'?''They don't actually consume all of it,' replied Owen.'Much of it is
wantonly wasted.They also make fortunes by selling some of it in
foreign countries; but they consume a great part of it themselves,
because the amount of labour expended on the things enjoyed by these
people is greater than that expended in the production of the things
used by the workers.Most of the people who do nothing get the best of
everything.More than three-quarters of the time of the working
classes is spent in producing the things used by the wealthy.Compare
the quality and quantity of the clothing possessed by the wife or
daughter of a rich man with that of the wife or daughter of a worker.The time and labour spent on producing the one is twenty times greater
in one case than in the other; and it's the same with everything else.Their homes, their clothing, boots, hats, jewellery, and their food.Everything must be of the very best that art or long and painful labour
can produce.But for most of those whose labour produces all these
good things--anything is considered good enough.For themselves, the
philanthropic workers manufacture shoddy cloth--that is, cheap cloth
made of old rags and dirt; and shoddy, uncomfortable ironclad boots.If you see a workman wearing a really good suit of clothes you may
safely conclude that he is either leading an unnatural life--that is,
he is not married--or that he has obtained it from a tallyman on the
hire system and has not yet paid for it--or that it is someone else's
cast-off suit that he has bought second-hand or had given to him by
some charitable person.All the ducks and
geese, pheasants, partridges, and all the very best parts of the very
best meat--all the soles and the finest plaice and salmon and trout--'

''Ere chuck it,' cried Harlow, fiercely.'We don't want to 'ear no
more of it,' and several others protested against the lecturer wasting
time on such mere details.

'--all the very best of everything is reserved exclusively for the
enjoyment of the people in divisions one and two, while the workers
subsist on block ornaments, margarine, adulterated tea, mysterious
beer, and are content--only grumbling when they are unable to obtain
even such fare as this.'Owen paused and a gloomy silence followed, but suddenly Crass
brightened up.He detected a serious flaw in the lecturer's argument.'You say the people in one and two gets all the best of everything, but
what about the tramps and beggars?You see, that's the proper place for them.They are no better mentally or morally than any of
the other loafers in that division; neither are they of any more use.Of course, when we consider them in relation to the amount they consume
of the things produced by others, they are not so harmful as the other
loafers, because they consume comparatively little.But all the same
they are in their right place in that division.All those people don't
get the same share.The section represents not individuals--but the
loafer class.''But I thought you said you was goin' to prove that money was the cause
of poverty,' said Easton.'Can't you see that it's money that's caused
all these people to lose sight of the true purpose of labour--the
production of the things we need?All these people are suffering from
the delusion that it doesn't matter what kind of work they do--or
whether they merely do nothing--so long as they get MONEY for doing it.Under the present extraordinary system, that's the only object they
have in view--to get money.Their ideas are so topsy-turvey that they
regard with contempt those who are engaged in useful work!With the
exception of criminals and the poorer sort of loafers, the working
classes are considered to be the lowest and least worthy in the
community.Those who manage to get money for doing something other
than productive work are considered more worthy of respect on that
account.Those who do nothing themselves, but get money out of the
labour of others, are regarded as being more worthy still!But the
ones who are esteemed most of all and honoured above all the rest, are
those who obtain money for doing absolutely nothing!''But I can't see as that proves that money is the cause of poverty,'
said Easton.'The people in number four produce everything,
don't they?''Yes; we knows all about that,' interrupted Harlow.'But they gets
paid for it, don't they?'Yes, and what does their wages consist of?''Why, money, of course,' replied Harlow, impatiently.And what do they do with their money when they get it?Do they eat it,
or drink it, or wear it?'At this apparently absurd question several of those who had hitherto
been attentive listeners laughed derisively; it was really very
difficult to listen patiently to such nonsense.'Of course they don't,' answered Harlow scornfully.'They buy the
things they want with it.''Do you think that most of them manage to save a part of their
wages--put it away in the bank.''Well, I can speak for meself,' replied Harlow amid laughter.'It
takes me all my bloody time to pay my rent and other expenses and to
keep my little lot in shoe leather, and it's dam little I spend on
beer; p'r'aps a tanner or a bob a week at the most.''A single man can save money if he likes,' said Slyme.'I'm not speaking of single men,' replied Owen.'I'm referring to
those who live natural lives.''What about all the money what's in the Post Office Savings Bank, and
Building and Friendly Societies?''A very large part of that belongs to people who are in business, or
who have some other source of income than their own wages.There are
some exceptionally fortunate workers who happen to have good situations
and higher wages than the ordinary run of workmen.Then there are some
who are so placed--by letting lodgings, for instance--that they are
able to live rent free.Others whose wives go out to work; and others
again who have exceptional jobs and work a lot of overtime--but these
are all exceptional cases.''I say as no married workin' man can save any money at all!'shouted
Harlow, 'not unless 'e goes without some of even the few things we are
able to get--and makes 'is wife and kids go without as well.'''Ear, 'ear,' said everybody except Crass and Slyme, who were both
thrifty working men, and each of them had some money saved in one or
other of the institutions mentioned.'Then that means,' said Owen, 'that means that the wages the people in
division four receive is not equivalent to the work they do.''Why the 'ell don't yer talk
plain English without draggin' in a lot of long words wot nobody can't
understand?''I mean this,' replied Owen, speaking very slowly.'Everything is
produced by the people in number four.In return for their work they
are given--Money, and the things they have made become the property of
the people who do nothing.Then, as the money is of no use, the
workers go to shops and give it away in exchange for some of the things
they themselves have made.They spend--or give back--ALL their wages;
but as the money they got as wages is not equal in value to the things
they produced, they find that they are only able to buy back a VERY
SMALL PART.So you see that these little discs of metal--this
Money--is a device for enabling those who do not work to rob the
workers of the greater part of the fruits of their toil.'The silence that ensued was broken by Crass.'It sounds very pretty,' he sneered, 'but I can't make no 'ead or tail
of it, meself.''The producing class--these people in number
four are supposed to be paid for their work.Their wages are supposed
to be equal in value to their work.If it were, by
spending all their wages, the producing class would be able to buy back
All they had produced.'Owen ceased speaking and silence once more ensued.No one gave any
sign of understanding, or of agreeing or of disagreeing with what he
had said.Barrington's pipe had
gone out during the argument.He relit it from the fire with a piece
of twisted paper.'If their wages were really equal in value to the product of their
labour,' Owen repeated, 'they would be able to buy back not a small
part--but the Whole.'...At this, a remark from Bundy caused a shout of laughter, and when
Wantley added point to the joke by making a sound like the discharge of
a pistol the merriment increased tenfold.'Well, that's done it,' remarked Easton, as he got up and opened the
window.'It's about time you was buried, if the smell's anything to go by,'
said Harlow, addressing Wantley, who laughed and appeared to think he
had distinguished himself.'But even if we include the whole of the working classes,' continued
Owen, 'that is, the people in number three as well as those in number
four, we find that their combined wages are insufficient to buy the
things made by the producers.The total value of the wealth produced
in this country during the last year was L1,800,000,000, and the total
amount paid in wages during the same period was only L600,000,000.In
other words, by means of the Money Trick, the workers were robbed of
two-thirds of the value of their labour.All the people in numbers
three and four are working and suffering and starving and fighting in
order that the rich people in numbers one and two may live in luxury,
and do nothing.These are the wretches who cause poverty: they not
only devour or waste or hoard the things made by the worker, but as
soon as their own wants are supplied--they compel the workers to cease
working and prevent them producing the things they need.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.cried Owen, his usually pale face flushing red and his eyes
shining with sudden anger,'most of these people do not deserve to be
called human beings at all!They know that whilst
they are indulging in pleasures of every kind--all around them men and
women and little children are existing in want or dying of hunger.'The silence which followed was at length broken by Harlow:

'You say the workers is entitled to all they produce, but you forget
there's the raw materials to pay for.'Of course the workers don't create the raw materials,' replied Owen.'But I am not aware that the capitalists or the landlords do so either.The raw materials exist in abundance in and on the earth, but they are
of no use until labour has been applied to them.''But then, you see, the earth belongs to the landlords!'cried Crass,
unguardedly.'I know that; and of course you think it's right that the whole country
should belong to a few people--'

'I must call the lecturer to horder,' interrupted Philpot.'The land
question is not before the meeting at present.''You talk about the producers being robbed of most of the value of what
they produce,' said Harlow, 'but you must remember that it ain't all
produced by hand labour.What about the things what's made by
machinery?''The machines themselves were made by the workers,' returned Owen, 'but
of course they do not belong to the workers, who have been robbed of
them by means of the Money Trick.''That's more than you or I or anyone else can say,' returned Owen, 'but
it certainly wasn't the wealthy loafer class, or the landlords, or the
employers.Most of the men who invented the machinery lived and died
unknown, in poverty and often in actual want.The inventors too were
robbed by the exploiter-of-labour class.There are no men living at
present who can justly claim to have invented the machinery that exists
today.The most they can truthfully say is that they have added to or
improved upon the ideas of those who lived and worked before them.Even Watt and Stevenson merely improved upon steam engines and
locomotives already existing.Your question has really nothing to do
with the subject we are discussing: we are only trying to find out why
the majority of people have to go short of the benefits of
civilization.One of the causes is--the majority of the population are
engaged in work that does not produce those things; and most of what IS
produced is appropriated and wasted by those who have no right to it.If you walk through the streets of a
town or a city, and look around, Everything that you can
see--Factories, Machinery, Houses, Railways, Tramways, Canals,
Furniture, Clothing, Food and the very road or pavement you stand upon
were all made by the working class, who spend all their wages in buying
back only a very small part of the things they produce.Therefore what
remains in the possession of their masters represents the difference
between the value of the work done and the wages paid for doing it.This systematic robbery has been going on for generations, the value of
the accumulated loot is enormous, and all of it, all the wealth at
present in the possession of the rich, is rightly the property of the
working class--it has been stolen from them by means of the Money
Trick.'...The men stared with
puzzled, uncomfortable looks alternately at each other and at the
drawings on the wall.They were compelled to do a little thinking on
their own account, and it was a process to which they were
unaccustomed.In their infancy they had been taught to distrust their
own intelligence and to leave 'thinking' to their 'pastors' and masters
and to their 'betters' generally.All their lives they had been true
to this teaching, they had always had blind, unreasoning faith in the
wisdom and humanity of their pastors and masters.That was the reason
why they and their children had been all their lives on the verge of
starvation and nakedness, whilst their 'betters'--who did nothing but
the thinking--went clothed in purple and fine linen and fared
sumptuously every day.Several men had risen from their seats and were attentively studying
the diagrams Owen had drawn on the wall; and nearly all the others were
making the same mental efforts--they were trying to think of something
to say in defence of those who robbed them of the fruits of their toil.'I don't see no bloody sense in always runnin' down the rich,' said
Harlow at last.'There's always been rich and poor in the world and
there always will be.''It says in the Bible that the poor shall
always be with us.''What the bloody 'ell kind of system do you think we ought to 'ave?''If everything's wrong, 'ow's it goin' to be altered?'At this, everybody brightened up again, and exchanged looks of
satisfaction and relief.It wasn't necessary to think
about these things at all!Nothing could ever be altered: it had
always been more or less the same, and it always would be.'It seems to me that you all HOPE it is impossible to alter it,' said
Owen.'Without trying to find out whether it could be done, you
persuade yourselves that it is impossible, and then, instead of being
sorry, you're glad!'Some of them laughed in a silly, half-ashamed way.'How do YOU reckon it could be altered?''The way to alter it is, first to enlighten the people as to the real
cause of their sufferings, and then--'

'Well,' interrupted Crass, with a self-satisfied chuckle, 'it'll take a
better bloody man than you to enlighten ME!''I don't want to be henlightened into Darkness!''But what sort of System do you propose, then?''After you've got 'em all enlightened--if you don't believe in sharing
out all the money equal, how ARE you goin' to alter it?''I don't know 'ow 'e's goin' to alter it,' sneered Crass, looking at
his watch and standing up, 'but I do know what the time is--two minits
past one!''The next lecture,' said Philpot, addressing the meeting as they all
prepared to return to work, 'the next lecture will be postponded till
tomorrer at the usual time, when it will be my painful dooty to call
upon Mr Owen to give 'is well-known and most hobnoxious address
entitled "Work and how to avoid it."Hall them as wants to be
henlightened kindly attend.''Or hall them as don't get the sack tonight,' remarked Easton grimly.Chapter 26

The Slaughter


During the afternoon, Rushton and Sweater visited the house, the latter
having an appointment to meet there a gardener to whom he wished to
give instructions concerning the laying out of the grounds, which had
been torn up for the purpose of putting in the new drains.Sweater had
already arranged with the head gardener of the public park to steal
some of the best plants from that place and have them sent up to 'The
Cave'.These plants had been arriving in small lots for about a week.They must have been brought there either in the evening after the men
left off or very early in the morning before they came.The two
gentlemen remained at the house for about half an hour and as they went
away the mournful sound of the Town Hall bell--which was always tolled
to summon meetings of the Council--was heard in the distance, and the
hands remarked to each other that another robbery was about to be
perpetrated.Hunter did not come to the job again that day: he had been sent by
Rushton to price some work for which the firm was going to tender an
estimate.There was only one person who felt any regret at his
absence, and that was Mrs White--Bert's mother, who had been working at
'The Cave' for several days, scrubbing the floors.As a rule, Hunter
paid her wages every night, and on this occasion she happened to need
the money even more than usual.As leaving off time drew near, she
mentioned the matter to Crass, who advised her to call at the office on
her way home and ask the young lady clerk for the money.As Hunter did
not appear, she followed the foreman's advice.When she reached the shop Rushton was just coming out.She explained
to him what she wanted and he instructed Mr Budd to tell Miss Wade to
pay her.The shopman accordingly escorted her to the office at the
back of the shop, and the young lady book-keeper--after referring to
former entries to make quite certain of the amount, paid her the sum
that Hunter had represented as her wages, the same amount that Miss
Wade had on the previous occasions given him to pay the charwoman.When
Mrs White got outside she found that she held in her hand half a crown
instead of the two shillings she usually received from Mr Hunter.At
first she felt inclined to take it back, but after some hesitation she
thought it better to wait until she saw Hunter, when she could tell him
about it; but the next morning when she saw the disciple at 'The Cave'
he broached the subject first, and told her that Miss Wade had made a
mistake.And that evening when he paid her, he deducted the sixpence
from the usual two shillings.The lecture announced by Philpot was not delivered.Anxiously awaiting
the impending slaughter the men kept tearing into it as usual, for they
generally keep working in the usual way, each one trying to outdo the
others so as not to lose his chance of being one of the lucky one...

Misery now went round and informed all the men with the exception of
Crass, Owen, Slyme and Sawkins--that they would have to stand off that
night.He told them that the firm had several jobs in view--work they
had tendered for and hoped to get, and said they could look round after
Christmas and he might--possibly--be able to start some of them again.They would be paid at the office tomorrow--Saturday--at one o'clock as
usual, but if any of them wished they could have their money tonight.The men thanked him, and most of them said they would come for their
wages at the usual pay-time, and would call round as he suggested,
after the holidays, to see if there was anything to do.In all, fifteen men--including Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Ned Dawson,
were to'stand off' that night.They took their dismissal stolidly,
without any remark, some of them even with an affectation of
indifference, but there were few attempts at conversation afterwards.The little work that remained to be done they did in silence, every man
oppressed by the same terror--the dread of the impending want, the
privation and unhappiness that they knew they and their families would
have to suffer during the next few months.Bundy and his mate Dawson were working in the kitchen fixing the new
range in place of the old one which they had taken out.They had been
engaged on this job all day, and their hands and faces and clothes were
covered with soot, which they had also contrived to smear and dab all
over the surfaces of the doors and other woodwork in the room, much to
the indignation of Crass and Slyme, who had to wash it all off before
they could put on the final coat of paint.'You can't help makin' a little mess on a job of this kind, you know,'
remarked Bundy, as he was giving the finishing touches to the work,
making good the broken parts of the wall with cement, whilst his mate
was clearing away the debris.'Yes; but there's no need to claw 'old of the bloody doors every time
you goes in and out,' snarled Crass, 'and you could 'ave put yer tools
on the floor instead of makin' a bench of the dresser.''You can 'ave the bloody place all to yerself in about five minutes,'
replied Bundy, as he assisted to lift a sack of cement weighing about
two hundredweight on to Dawson's back.When they had cleared away all the dirt and fragments of bricks and
mortar, while Crass and Slyme proceeded with the painting, Bundy and
Dawson loaded up their hand-cart with the old range and the bags of
unused cement and plaster, which they took back to the yard.Meantime,
Misery was wandering about the house and gounds like an evil spirit
seeking rest and finding none.He stood for some time gloomily
watching the four gardeners, who were busily at work laying strips of
turf, mowing the lawn, rolling the gravel paths and trimming the trees
and bushes.The boy Bert, Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Sawkins were
loading a hand-cart with ladders and empty paint-pots to return to the
yard.Just as they were setting out, Misery stopped them, remarking
that the cart was not half loaded--he said it would take a month to get
all the stuff away if they went on like that; so by his directions they
placed another long ladder on top of the pile and once more started on
their way, but before they had gone two dozen yards one of the wheels
of the cart collapsed and the load was scattered over the roadway.Bert was at the same side of the cart as the wheel that broke and he
was thrown violently to the ground, where he lay half stunned, in the
midst of the ladders and planks.When they got him out they were
astonished to find that, thanks to the special Providence that watches
over all small boys, he was almost unhurt--just a little dazed, that
was all; and by the time Sawkins returned with another cart, Bert was
able to help to gather up the fallen paint-pots and to accompany the
men with the load to the yard.At the corner of the road they paused
to take a last look at the 'job'.said Harlow, tragically, extending his arm towards
the house.A job that if they'd only have let us do
it properly, couldn't 'ave been done with the number of 'ands we've
'ad, in less than four months; and there it is, finished, messed up,
slobbered over and scamped, in nine weeks!''Yes, and now we can all go to 'ell,' said Philpot, gloomily.At the yard they found Bundy and his mate, Ned Dawson, who helped them
to hang up the ladders in their usual places.Philpot was glad to get
out of assisting to do this, for he had contracted a rather severe
attack of rheumatism when working outside at the 'Cave'.Whilst the
others were putting the ladders away he assisted Bert to carry the
paint-pots and buckets into the paint shop, and while there he filled a
small medicine bottle he had brought with him for the purpose, with
turpentine from the tank.He wanted this stuff to rub into his
shoulders and legs, and as he secreted the bottle in the inner pocket
of his coat, he muttered: 'This is where we gets some of our own back.'They took the key of the yard to the office and as they separated to go
home Bundy suggested that the best thing they could do would be to sew
their bloody mouths up for a few months, because there was not much
probability of their getting another job until about March.The next morning while Crass and Slyme were finishing inside, Owen
wrote the two gates.On the front entrance 'The Cave' and on the back
'Tradesmens Entrance', in gilded letters.In the meantime, Sawkins and
Bert made several journeys to the Yard with the hand-cart.Crass--working in the kitchen with Slyme--was very silent and
thoughtful.Ever since the job was started, every time Mr Sweater had
visited the house to see what progress was being made, Crass had been
grovelling to him in the hope of receiving a tip when the work was
finished.He had been very careful to act upon any suggestions that
Sweater had made from time to time and on several occasions had taken a
lot of trouble to get just the right tints of certain colours, making
up a number of different shades and combinations, and doing parts of
the skirtings or mouldings of rooms in order that Mr Sweater might see
exactly--before they went on with it--what it would look like when
finished.He made a great pretence of deferring to Sweater's opinion,
and assured him that he did not care how much trouble he took as long
as he--Sweater--was pleased.In fact, it was no trouble at all: it was
a pleasure.As the work neared completion, Crass began to speculate
upon the probable amount of the donation he would receive as the reward
of nine weeks of cringing, fawning, abject servility.He thought it
quite possible that he might get a quid: it would not be too much,
considering all the trouble he had taken.At
any rate, he felt certain that he was sure to get ten bob; a gentleman
like Mr Sweater would never have the cheek to offer less.The more he
thought about it the more improbable it appeared that the amount would
be less than a quid, and he made up his mind that whatever he got he
would take good care that none of the other men knew anything about it.HE was the one who had had all the worry of the job, and he was the
only one entitled to anything there was to be had.Besides, even if he
got a quid, by the time you divided that up amongst a dozen--or even
amongst two or three--it would not be worth having.At about eleven o'clock Mr Sweater arrived and began to walk over the
house, followed by Crass, who carried a pot of paint and a small brush
and made believe to be 'touching up' and finishing off parts of the
work.As Sweater went from one room to another Crass repeatedly placed
himself in the way in the hope of being spoken to, but Sweater took no
notice of him whatever.Once or twice Crass's heart began to beat
quickly as he furtively watched the great man and saw him thrust his
thumb and finger into his waistcoat pocket, but on each occasion
Sweater withdrew his hand with nothing in it.After a while, observing
that the gentleman was about to depart without having spoken, Crass
determined to break the ice himself.'It's a little better weather we're 'avin' now, sir.''I was beginnin' to be afraid as I shouldn't be hable to git
heverything finished in time for you to move in before Christmas, sir,'
Crass continued, 'but it's hall done now, sir.''I've kept the fire agoin' in hall the rooms has you told me, sir,'
resumed Crass after a pause.'I think you'll find as the place is nice
and dry, sir; the honly places as is a bit damp is the kitchen and
scullery and the other rooms in the basement, sir, but of course that's
nearly halways the case, sir, when the rooms is partly hunderground,
sir.'But of course it don't matter so much about the basement, sir, because
it's honly the servants what 'as to use it, sir, and even down there
it'll be hall right hin the summer, sir.'One would scarcely think, from the contemptuous way in which he spoke
of'servants' that Crass's own daughter was 'in service', but such was
the case.'Oh, yes, there's no doubt about that,' replied Sweater as he moved
towards the door; 'there's no doubt it will be dry enough in the
summer.'Good morning to YOU, sir,' said Crass, following him.'I 'opes as
you're pleased with all the work, sir; everything satisfactory, sir.'I think it looks very nice; very nice indeed; I'm very
pleased with it,' said Sweater affably.'Good morning, sir,' replied the foreman with a sickly smile as Sweater
departed.When the other was gone, Crass sat down dejectedly on the bottom step
of the stairs, overwhelmed with the ruin of his hopes and expectations.He tried to comfort himself with the reflection that all hope was not
lost, because he would have to come to the house again on Monday and
Tuesday to fix the venetian blinds; but all the same he could not help
thinking that it was only a very faint hope, for he felt that if
Sweater had intended giving anything he would have done so today; and
it was very improbable that he would see Sweater on Monday or Tuesday
at all, for the latter did not usually visit the job in the early part
of the week.However, Crass made up his mind to hope for the best,
and, pulling himself together, he presently returned to the kitchen,
where he found Slyme and Sawkins waiting for him.He had not mentioned
his hopes of a tip to either of them, but they did not need any telling
and they were both determined to have their share of whatever he got.demanded Sawkins, going straight to the point.Slyme laughed in a sneering, incredulous way, but Sawkins was inclined
to be abusive.He averred that he had been watching Crass and Sweater
and had seen the latter put his thumb and finger into his waistcoat
pocket as he walked into the dining-room, followed by Crass.It took
the latter a long time to convince his two workmates of the truth of
his own account, but he succeeded at last, and they all three agreed
that Old Sweater was a sanguinary rotter, and they lamented over the
decay of the good old-fashioned customs.'Why, at one time o' day,' said Crass, 'only a few years ago, if you
went to a gentleman's 'ouse to paint one or two rooms you could always
be sure of a bob or two when you'd finished.'By half past twelve everything was squared up, and, having loaded up
the hand-cart with all that remained of the materials, dirty paint-pots
and plant, they all set out together for the yard, to put all the
things away before going to the office for their money.Sawkins took
the handle of the cart, Slyme and Crass walked at one side and Owen and
Bert at the other.There was no need to push, for the road was
downhill most of the way; so much so that they had all to help to hold
back the cart, which travelled so rapidly that Bert found it difficult
to keep pace with the others and frequently broke into a trot to
recover lost ground, and Crass--being fleshy and bloated with beer,
besides being unused to much exertion--began to perspire and soon
appealed to the others not to let it go so fast--there was no need to
get done before one o'clock.Chapter 27

The March of the Imperialists


It was an unusually fine day for the time of year, and as they passed
along the Grand Parade--which faced due south--they felt quite warm.The Parade was crowded with richly dressed and bejewelled loafers,
whose countenances in many instances bore unmistakable signs of
drunkenness and gluttony.Some of the females had tried to conceal the
ravages of vice and dissipation by coating their faces with powder and
paint.Mingling with and part of this crowd were a number of
well-fed-looking individuals dressed in long garments of black cloth of
the finest texture, and broad-brimmed soft felt hats.Most of these
persons had gold rings on their soft white fingers and glove-like kid
or calfskin boots on their feet.They belonged to the great army of
imposters who obtain an easy living by taking advantage of the
ignorance and simplicity of their fellow-men, and pretending to be the
'followers' and'servants' of the lowly Carpenter of Nazareth--the Man
of Sorrows, who had not where to lay His head.None of these black-garbed 'disciples' were associating with the groups
of unemployed carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, and painters who
stood here and there in the carriage-way dressed in mean and shabby
clothing and with faces pale with privation.Many of these latter were
known to our friends with the cart, and nodded to them as they passed.Now and then some of them came over and walked a little distance by
their side, inquiring whether there was any news of another job at
Rushton's.When they were about half-way down the Parade, just near the Fountain,
Crass and his mates encountered a number of men on whose arms were
white bands with the word 'Collector' in black letters.They carried
collecting boxes and accosted the people in the street, begging for
money for the unemployed.These men were a kind of skirmishers for the
main body, which could be seen some distance behind.As the procession drew near, Sawkins steered the cart into the kerb and
halted as they went past.There were about three hundred men
altogether, marching four abreast.They carried three large white
banners with black letters, 'Thanks to our Subscribers' 'In aid of
Genuine Unemployed', 'The Children must be Fed'.Although there were a
number of artisans in the procession, the majority of the men belonged
to what is called the unskilled labourer class.The skilled artisan
does not as a rule take part in such a procession except as a very last
resource...  And all the time he strives to keep up an appearance of
being well-to-do, and would be highly indignant if anyone suggested
that he was really in a condition of abject, miserable poverty.Although he knows that his children are often not so well fed as are
the pet dogs and cats of his 'betters', he tries to bluff his
neighbours into thinking that he has some mysterious private means of
which they know nothing, and conceals his poverty as if it were a
crime.Most of this class of men would rather starve than beg.Consequently not more than a quarter of the men in the procession were
skilled artisans; the majority were labourers.There was also a sprinkling of those unfortunate outcasts of
society--tramps and destitute, drunken loafers.If the self-righteous
hypocrites who despise these poor wretches had been subjected to the
same conditions, the majority of them would inevitably have become the
same as these.Haggard and pale, shabbily or raggedly dressed, their boots broken and
down at heel, they slouched past.Some of them stared about with a
dazed or half-wild expression, but most of them walked with downcast
eyes or staring blankly straight in front of them.They appeared
utterly broken-spirited, hopeless and ashamed...

'Anyone can see what THEY are,' sneered Crass, 'there isn't fifty
genuine tradesmen in the whole crowd, and most of 'em wouldn't work if
they 'ad the offer of it.''That's just what I was thinkin',' agreed Sawkins with a laugh.'There will be plenty of time to say that when they have been offered
work and have refused to do it,' said Owen.'This sort of thing does the town a lot of 'arm,' remarked Slyme; 'it
oughtn't to be allowed; the police ought to stop it.It's enough to
drive all the gentry out of the place!''Bloody disgraceful, I call it,' said Crass,'marchin' along the Grand
Parade on a beautiful day like this, just at the very time when most of
the gentry is out enjoyin' the fresh hair.''I suppose you think they ought to stay at home and starve quietly,'
said Owen.'I don't see why these men should care what harm they do to
the town; the town doesn't seem to care much what becomes of THEM.''Do you believe in this sort of thing, then?'I don't believe in begging as a favour for what
one is entitled to demand as a right from the thieves who have robbed
them and who are now enjoying the fruits of their labour.From the
look of shame on their faces you might think that they were the
criminals instead of being the victims.''Well you must admit that most of them is very inferior men,' said
Crass with a self-satisfied air.'There's very few mechanics amongst
em.''They're human beings, and they have as much right to live as
anyone else.What is called unskilled labour is just as necessary and
useful as yours or mine.I am no more capable of doing the "unskilled"
labour that most of these men do than most of them would be capable of
doing my work.''Well, if they was skilled tradesmen, they might find it easier to get
a job,' said Crass.'Do you mean to say you think that if all these men could be
transformed into skilled carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, and
painters, that it would be easier for all those other chaps whom we
passed a little while ago to get work?Is it possible that you or any
other sane man can believe anything so silly as that?''If there is not enough work to employ all the mechanics whom we see
standing idle about the streets, how would it help these labourers in
the procession if they could all become skilled workmen?'Still Crass did not answer, and neither Slyme nor Sawkins came to his
assistance.'If that could be done,' continued Owen, 'it would simply make things
worse for those who are already skilled mechanics.A greater number of
skilled workers--keener competition for skilled workmen's jobs--a
larger number of mechanics out of employment, and consequently,
improved opportunities for employers to reduce wages.That is probably
the reason why the Liberal Party--which consists for the most part of
exploiters of labour--procured the great Jim Scalds to tell us that
improved technical education is the remedy for unemployment and
poverty.''I suppose you think Jim Scalds is a bloody fool, the same as everybody
else what don't see things YOUR way?''I should think he was a fool if I thought he believed what he says.He says it because he thinks the
majority of the working classes are such fools that they will believe
him.If he didn't think that most of us are fools he wouldn't tell us
such a yarn as that.''And I suppose you think as 'is opinion ain't far wrong,' snarled Crass.'We shall be better able to judge of that after the next General
Election,' replied Owen.'If the working classes again elect a
majority of Liberal or Tory landlords and employers to rule over them,
it will prove that Jim Scalds' estimate of their intelligence is about
right.''Well, anyhow,' persisted Slyme, 'I don't think it's a right thing that
they should be allowed to go marchin' about like that--driving visitors
out of the town.''What do you think they ought to do, then?''Let the b--rs go to the bloody workhouse!''But before they could be received there they would have to be
absolutely homeless and destitute, and then the ratepayers would have
to keep them.It costs about twelve shillings a week for each inmate,
so it seems to me that it would be more sensible and economical for the
community to employ them on some productive work.'They had by this time arrived at the yard.The steps and ladders were
put away in their places and the dirty paint-pots and pails were placed
in the paint-shop on the bench and on the floor.With what had
previously been brought back there were a great many of these things,
all needing to be cleaned out, so Bert at any rate stood in no danger
of being out of employment for some time to come.When they were paid at the office, Owen on opening his envelope found
it contained as usual, a time sheet for the next week, which meant that
he was not'stood off' although he did not know what work there would
be to do.Crass and Slyme were both to go to the 'Cave' to fix the
venetian blinds, and Sawkins also was to come to work as usual.Chapter 28

The Week before Christmas


During the next week Owen painted a sign on the outer wall of one of
the workshops at the yard, and he also wrote the name of the firm on
three of the handcarts.These and other odd jobs kept him employed a few hours every day, so
that he was not actually out of work.One afternoon--there being nothing to do--he went home at three
o'clock, but almost as soon as he reached the house Bert White came
with a coffin-plate which had to be written at once.The lad said he
had been instructed to wait for it.Nora gave the boy some tea and bread and butter to eat whilst Owen was
doing the coffin-plate, and presently Frankie--who had been playing out
in the street--made his appearance.The two boys were already known to
each other, for Bert had been there several times before--on errands
similar to the present one, or to take lessons on graining and
letter-painting from Owen.'I'm going to have a party next Monday--after Christmas,' remarked
Frankie.'Mother told me I might ask you if you'll come?''All right,' said Bert; 'and I'll bring my Pandoramer.'No, of course not,' replied Bert with a superior air.'It's a
show, like they have at the Hippodrome or the Circus.''Not very big: it's made out of a sugar-box.It's
not quite finished yet, but I shall get it done this week.There's a
band as well, you know.'This' was a large mouth organ which he produced from the inner pocket
of his coat.Bert accordingly played, and Frankie sang at the top of his voice a
selection of popular songs, including 'The Old Bull and Bush', 'Has
Anyone seen a German Band?', 'Waiting at the Church' and
finally--possibly as a dirge for the individual whose coffin-plate Owen
was writing--'Goodbye, Mignonette' and 'I wouldn't leave my little
wooden hut for you'.'You don't know what's in that,' said Frankie, referring to a large
earthenware bread-pan which Nora had just asked Owen to help her to
lift from the floor on to one of the chairs.The vessel in question
was covered with a clean white cloth.'We got the things out of
the Christmas Club on Saturday.We've been paying in ever since last
Christmas.We're going to mix it now, and you can have a stir too if
you like, for luck.'Whilst they were stirring the pudding, Frankie several times requested
the others to feel his muscle: he said he felt sure that he would soon
be strong enough to go out to work, and he explained to Bert that the
extraordinary strength he possessed was to be attributed to the fact
that he lived almost exclusively on porridge and milk.For the rest of the week, Owen continued to work down at the yard with
Sawkins, Crass, and Slyme, painting some of the ladders, steps and
other plant belonging to the firm.These things had to have two coats
of paint and the name Rushton & Co.As soon as they
had got some of them second-coated, Owen went on with the writing,
leaving the painting for the others, so as to share the work as fairly
as possible.Several times during the week one or other of them was
taken away to do some other work; once Crass and Slyme had to go and
wash off and whiten a ceiling somewhere, and several times Sawkins was
sent out to assist the plumbers.Every day some of the men who had been'stood off' called at the yard
to ask if any other 'jobs' had 'come in'.From these callers they
heard all the news.Old Jack Linden had not succeeded in getting
anything to do at the trade since he was discharged from Rushton's, and
it was reported that he was trying to earn a little money by hawking
bloaters from house to house.As for Philpot, he said that he had been
round to nearly all the firms in the town and none of them had any work
to speak of.Newman--the man whom the reader will remember was sacked for taking too
much pains with his work--had been arrested and sentenced to a month's
imprisonment because he had not been able to pay his poor rates, and
the Board of Guardians were allowing his wife three shillings a week to
maintain herself and the three children.Philpot had been to see them,
and she told him that the landlord was threatening to turn them into
the street; he would have seized their furniture and sold it if it had
been worth the expense of the doing.'I feel ashamed of meself,' Philpot added in confidence to Owen, 'when
I think of all the money I chuck away on beer.If it wasn't for that,
I shouldn't be in such a hole meself now, and I might be able to lend
'em a 'elpin' 'and.''It ain't so much that I likes the beer, you know,' he continued; 'it's
the company.When you ain't got no 'ome, in a manner o' speakin', like
me, the pub's about the only place where you can get a little
enjoyment.But you ain't very welcome there unless you spends your
money.''Is the three shillings all they have to live on?''I think she goes out charin' when she can get it,' replied Philpot,
'but I don't see as she can do a great deal o' that with three young
'uns to look after, and from what I hear of it she's only just got over
a illness and ain't fit to do much.''I'll tell you what,' said Philpot.'I've been thinking we might get
up a bit of a subscription for 'em.There's several chaps in work what
knows Newman, and if they was each to give a trifle we could get enough
to pay for a Christmas dinner, anyway.I've brought a sheet of
foolscap with me, and I was goin' to ask you to write out the heading
for me.'As there was no pen available at the workshop, Philpot waited till four
o'clock and then accompanied Owen home, where the heading of the list
was written.Owen put his name down for a shilling and Philpot his for
a similar amount.Philpot stayed to tea and accepted an invitation to spend Christmas Day
with them, and to come to Frankie's party on the Monday after.The next morning Philpot brought the list to the yard and Crass and
Slyme put their names down for a shilling each, and Sawkins for
threepence, it being arranged that the money was to be paid on
payday--Christmas Eve.In the meantime, Philpot was to see as many as
he could of those who were in work, at other firms and get as many
subscriptions as possible.At pay-time on Christmas Eve Philpot turned up with the list and Owen
and the others paid him the amounts they had put their names down for.From other men he had succeeded in obtaining nine and sixpence, mostly
in sixpences and threepences.Some of this money he had already
received, but for the most part he had made appointments with the
subscribers to call at their homes that evening.It was decided that
Owen should accompany him and also go with him to hand over the money
to Mrs Newman.It took them nearly three hours to get in all the money, for the places
they had to go to were in different localities, and in one or two cases
they had to wait because their man had not yet come home, and sometimes
it was not possible to get away without wasting a little time in talk.In three instances those who had put their names down for threepence
increased the amount to sixpence and one who had promised sixpence gave
a shilling.There were two items of threepence each which they did not
get at all, the individuals who had put their names down having gone
upon the drunk.Another cause of delay was that they met or called on
several other men who had not yet been asked for a subscription, and
there were several others--including some members of the Painters
Society whom Owen had spoken to during the week--who had promised him
to give a subscription.In the end they succeeded in increasing the
total amount to nineteen and ninepence, and they then put
three-halfpence each to make it up to a pound.The Newmans lived in a small house the rent of which was six shillings
per week and taxes.To reach the house one had to go down a dark and
narrow passage between two shops, the house being in a kind of well,
surrounded by the high walls of the back parts of larger
buildings--chiefly business premises and offices.The air did not
circulate very freely in this place, and the rays of the sun never
reached it.In the summer the atmosphere was close and foul with the
various odours which came from the back-yards of the adjoining
buildings, and in the winter it was dark and damp and gloomy, a
culture-ground for bacteria and microbes.The majority of those who
profess to be desirous of preventing and curing the disease called
consumption must be either hypocrites or fools, for they ridicule the
suggestion that it is necessary first to cure and prevent the poverty
that compels badly clothed and half-starved human beings to sleep in
such dens as this.The front door opened into the living-room or, rather, kitchen, which
was dimly lighted by a small paraffin lamp on the table, where were
also some tea-cups and saucers, each of a different pattern, and the
remains of a loaf of bread.The wallpaper was old and discoloured; a
few almanacs and unframed prints were fixed to the walls, and on the
mantelshelf were some cracked and worthless vases and ornaments.At
one time they had possessed a clock and an overmantel and some framed
pictures, but they had all been sold to obtain money to buy food.Nearly everything of any value had been parted with for the same
reason--the furniture, the pictures, the bedclothes, the carpet and the
oilcloth, piece by piece, nearly everything that had once constituted
the home--had been either pawned or sold to buy food or to pay rent
during the times when Newman was out of work--periods that had recurred
during the last few years with constantly increasing frequency and
duration.Now there was nothing left but these few old broken chairs
and the deal table which no one would buy; and upstairs, the wretched
bedsteads and mattresses whereon they slept at night, covering
themselves with worn-out remnants of blankets and the clothes they wore
during the day.In answer to Philpot's knock, the door was opened by a little girl
about seven years old, who at once recognized Philpot, and called out
his name to her mother, and the latter came also to the door, closely
followed by two other children, a little, fragile-looking girl about
three, and a boy about five years of age, who held on to her skirt and
peered curiously at the visitors.Mrs Newman was about thirty, and her
appearance confirmed the statement of Philpot that she had only just
recovered from an illness; she was very white and thin and
dejected-looking.When Philpot explained the object of their visit and
handed her the money, the poor woman burst into tears, and the two
smaller children--thinking that this piece of paper betokened some
fresh calamity--began to cry also.They remembered that all their
troubles had been preceded by the visits of men who brought pieces of
paper, and it was rather difficult to reassure them.That evening, after Frankie was asleep, Owen and Nora went out to do
their Christmas marketing.They had not much money to spend, for Owen
had brought home only seventeen shillings.He had worked thirty-three
hours--that came to nineteen and threepence--one shilling and
threehalfpence had gone on the subscription list, and he had given the
rest of the coppers to a ragged wreck of a man who was singing a hymn
in the street.The other shilling had been deducted from his wages in
repayment of a'sub' he had had during the week.There was a great deal to be done with this seventeen shillings.First
of all there was the rent--seven shillings--that left ten.Then there
was the week's bread bill--one and threepence.They had a pint of milk
every day, chiefly for the boy's sake--that came to one and two.Then
there was one and eight for a hundredweight of coal that had been
bought on credit.Fortunately, there were no groceries to buy, for the
things they had obtained with their Christmas Club money would be more
than sufficient for the ensuing week.Frankie's stockings were all broken and beyond mending, so it was
positively necessary to buy him another pair for fivepence
three-farthings.These stockings were not much good--a pair at double
the price would have been much cheaper, for they would have lasted
three or four times longer; but they could not afford to buy the dearer
kind.It was just the same with the coal: if they had been able to
afford it, they could have bought a ton of the same class of coal for
twenty-six shillings, but buying it as they did, by the hundredweight,
they had to pay at the rate of thirty-three shillings and fourpence a
ton.It was just the same with nearly everything else.This is how
the working classes are robbed.Although their incomes are the lowest,
they are compelled to buy the most expensive articles--that is, the
lowest-priced articles.Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or
furniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more
money at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to
buy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any
price.Six weeks previously Owen bought a pair of second-hand boots for three
shillings and they were now literally falling to pieces.Nora's shoes
were in much the same condition, but, as she said, it did not matter so
much about hers because there was no need for her to go out if the
weather were not fine.In addition to the articles already mentioned, they had to spend
fourpence for half a gallon of paraffin oil, and to put sixpence into
the slot of the gas-stove.This reduced the money to five and
sevenpence farthing, and of this it was necessary to spend a shilling
on potatoes and other vegetables.They both needed some new underclothing, for what they had was so old
and worn that it was quite useless for the purpose it was supposed to
serve; but there was no use thinking of these things, for they had now
only four shillings and sevenpence farthing left, and all that would be
needed for toys.They had to buy something special for Frankie for
Christmas, and it would also be necessary to buy something for each of
the children who were coming to the party on the following Monday.Fortunately, there was no meat to buy, for Nora had been paying into
the Christmas Club at the butcher's as well as at the grocer's.They stopped to look at the display of toys at Sweater's Emporium.For
several days past Frankie had been talking of the wonders contained in
these windows, so they wished if possible to buy him something here.They recognized many of the things from the description the boy had
given of them, but nearly everything was so dear that for a long time
they looked in vain for something it would be possible to buy.'That's the engine he talks so much about,' said Non, indicating a
model railway locomotive; that one marked five shillings.''It might just as well be marked five pounds as far as we're
concerned,' replied Owen.As they were speaking, one of the salesmen appeared at the back of the
window and, reaching forward, removed the engine.It was probably the
last one of the kind and had evidently just been sold.Owen and Nora
experienced a certain amount of consolation in knowing that even if
they had the money they would not have been able to buy it.After lengthy consideration, they decided on a clockwork engine at a
shilling, but the other toys they resolved to buy at a cheaper shop.Nora went into the Emporium to get the toy and whilst Owen was waiting
for her Mr and Mrs Rushton came out.They did not appear to see Owen,
who observed that the shape of one of several parcels they carried
suggested that it contained the engine that had been taken from the
window a little while before.When Nora returned with her purchase, they went in search of a cheaper
place and after a time they found what they wanted.For sixpence they
bought a cardboard box that had come all the way from Japan and
contained a whole family of dolls--father, mother and four children of
different sizes.A box of paints, threepence: a sixpenny tea service,
a threepenny drawing slate, and a rag doll, sixpence.On their way home they called at a greengrocer's where Owen had ordered
and paid for a small Christmas tree a few weeks before; and as they
were turning the corner of the street where they lived they met Crass,
half-drunk, with a fine fat goose slung over his shoulder by its neck.He greeted Owen jovially and held up the bird for their inspection.'Not a bad tanner's-worth, eh?'I won this and a box of cigars--fifty--for a tanner, and the
other one I got out of the Club at our Church Mission 'all: threepence
a week for twenty-eight weeks; that makes seven bob.But,' he added,
confidentially,''you couldn't buy 'em for that price in a shop, you
know.They costs the committee a good bit more nor that--wholesale;
but we've got some rich gents on our committee and they makes up the
difference,' and with a nod and a cunning leer he lurched off.Frankie was sleeping soundly when they reached home, and so was the
kitten, which was curled up on the quilt on the foot of the bed.After
they had had some supper, although it was after eleven o'clock, Owen
fixed the tree in a large flower-pot that had served a similar purpose
before, and Nora brought out from the place where it had been stored
away since last Christmas a cardboard box containing a lot of
glittering tinsel ornaments--globes of silvered or gilded or painted
glass, birds, butterflies and stars.Some of these things had done
duty three Christmases ago and although they were in some instances
slightly tarnished most of them were as good as new.In addition to
these and the toys they had bought that evening they had a box of
bon-bons and a box of small  wax candles, both of which had
formed part of the things they got from the grocer's with the Christmas
Club money; and there were also a lot of little  paper bags of
sweets, and a number of sugar and chocolate toys and animals which had
been bought two or three at a time for several weeks past and put away
for this occasion.There was something suitable for each child that
was coming, with the exception of Bert White; they had intended to
include a sixpenny pocket knife for him in their purchases that
evening, but as they had not been able to afford this Owen decided to
give him an old set of steel graining combs which he knew the lad had
often longed to possess.The tin case containing these tools was
accordingly wrapped in some red tissue paper and hung on the tree with
the other things.They moved about as quietly as possible so as not to disturb those who
were sleeping in the rooms beneath, because long before they were
finished the people in the other parts of the house had all retired to
rest, and silence had fallen on the deserted streets outside.As they
were putting the final touches to their work the profound stillness of
the night was suddenly broken by the voices of a band of carol-singers.The sound overwhelmed them with memories of other and happier times,
and Nora stretched out her hands impulsively to Owen, who drew her
close to his side.They had been married just over eight years, and although during all
that time they had never been really free from anxiety for the future,
yet on no previous Christmas had they been quite so poor as now.During
the last few years periods of unemployment had gradually become more
frequent and protracted, and the attempt he had made in the early part
of the year to get work elsewhere had only resulted in plunging them
into even greater poverty than before.But all the same there was much
to be thankful for: poor though they were, they were far better off
than many thousands of others: they still had food and shelter, and
they had each other and the boy.Before they went to bed Owen carried the tree into Frankie's bedroom
and placed it so that he would be able to see it in all its glittering
glory as soon as he awoke on Christmas morning.Chapter 29

The Pandorama


Although the party was not supposed to begin till six o'clock, Bert
turned up at half past four, bringing the 'Pandoramer' with him.At about half past five the other guests began to arrive.Elsie and
Charley Linden came first, the girl in a pretty blue frock trimmed with
white lace, and Charley resplendent in a new suit, which, like his
sister's dress, had been made out of somebody's cast-off clothes that
had been given to their mother by a visiting lady.It had taken Mrs
Linden many hours of hard work to contrive these garments; in fact,
more time than the things were worth, for although they looked all
right--especially Elsie's--the stuff was so old that it would not wear
very long: but this was the only way in which she could get clothes for
the children at all: she certainly could not afford to buy them any.So she spent hours and hours making things that she knew would fall to
pieces almost as soon as they were made.After these came Nellie, Rosie and Tommy Newman.These presented a
much less prosperous appearance than the other two.Their mother was
not so skilful at contriving new clothes out of old.Nellie was
wearing a grown-up woman's blouse, and by way of ulster she had on an
old-fashioned jacket of thick cloth with large pearl buttons.This was
also a grown-up woman's garment: it was shaped to fit the figure of a
tall woman with wide shoulders and a small waist; consequently, it did
not fit Nellie to perfection.The waist reached below the poor child's
hips.Tommy was arrayed in the patched remains of what had once been a good
suit of clothes.They had been purchased at a second-hand shop last
summer and had been his 'best' for several months, but they were now
much too small for him.Little Rosie--who was only just over three years old--was better off
than either of the other two, for she had a red cloth dress that fitted
her perfectly: indeed, as the district visitor who gave it to her
mother had remarked, it looked as if it had been made for her.'It's not much to look at,' observed Nellie, referring to her big
jacket, but all the same we was very glad of it when the rain came on.'The coat was so big that by withdrawing her arms from the sleeves and
using it as a cloak or shawl she had managed to make it do for all
three of them.Tommy's boots were so broken that the wet had got in and saturated his
stockings, so Nora made him take them all off and wear some old ones of
Frankie's whilst his own were drying at the fire.Philpot, with two large paper bags full of oranges and nuts, arrived
just as they were sitting down to tea--or rather cocoa--for with the
exception of Bert all the children expressed a preference for the
latter beverage.Bert would have liked to have cocoa also, but hearing
that the grown-ups were going to have tea, he thought it would be more
manly to do the same.This question of having tea or cocoa for tea
became a cause of much uproarious merriment on the part of the
children, who asked each other repeatedly which they liked best, 'tea
tea?'They thought it so funny that they said it over
and over again, screaming with laughter all the while, until Tommy got
a piece of cake stuck in his throat and became nearly black in the
face, and then Philpot had to turn him upside down and punch him in the
back to save him from choking to death.This rather sobered the
others, but for some time afterwards whenever they looked at each other
they began to laugh afresh because they thought it was such a good joke.When they had filled themselves up with the 'cocoa-tea' and cakes and
bread and jam, Elsie Linden and Nellie Newman helped to clear away the
cups and saucers, and then Owen lit the candles on the Christmas tree
and distributed the toys to the children, and a little while afterwards
Philpot--who had got a funny-looking mask out of one of the
bon-bons--started a fine game pretending to be a dreadful wild animal
which he called a Pandroculus, and crawling about on all fours, rolled
his goggle eyes and growled out he must have a little boy or girl to
eat for his supper.He looked so terrible that although they knew it was only a joke they
were almost afraid of him, and ran away laughing and screaming to
shelter themselves behind Nora or Owen; but all the same, whenever
Philpot left off playing, they entreated him to 'be it again', and so
he had to keep on being a Pandroculus, until exhaustion compelled him
to return to his natural form.After this they all sat round the table and had a game of cards;
'Snap', they called it, but nobody paid much attention to the rules of
the game: everyone seemed to think that the principal thing to do was
to kick up as much row as possible.After a while Philpot suggested a
change to 'Beggar my neighbour', and won quite a lot of cards before
they found out that he had hidden all the jacks in the pocket of his
coat, and then they mobbed him for a cheat.He might have been
seriously injured if it had not been for Bert, who created a diversion
by standing on a chair and announcing that he was about to introduce to
their notice 'Bert White's World-famed Pandorama' as exhibited before
all the nobility and crowned heads of Europe, England, Ireland and
Scotland, including North America and Wales.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of Bert's speech.The box was
placed on the table, which was then moved to the end of the room, and
the chairs were ranged in two rows in front.The 'Pandorama' consisted of a stage-front made of painted cardboard
and fixed on the front of a wooden box about three feet long by two
feet six inches high, and about one foot deep from back to front.The
'Show' was a lot of pictures cut out of illustrated weekly papers and
pasted together, end to end, so as to form a long strip or ribbon.Bert
had  all the pictures with water-colours.Just behind the wings of the stage-front at each end of the box--was an
upright roller, and the long strip of pictures was rolled up on this.The upper ends of the rollers came through the top of the box and had
handles attached to them.When these handles were turned the pictures
passed across the stage, unrolling from one roller and rolling on to
the other, and were illuminated by the light of three candles placed
behind.The idea of constructing this machine had been suggested to Bert by a
panorama entertainment he had been to see some time before.'The Style of the decorations,' he remarked, alluding to the painted
stage-front, 'is Moorish.'He lit the candles at the back of the stage and, having borrowed a
tea-tray from Nora, desired the audience to take their seats.When
they had all done so, he requested Owen to put out the lamp and the
candles on the tree, and then he made another speech, imitating the
manner of the lecturer at the panorama entertainment before mentioned.'Ladies and Gentlemen: with your kind permission I am about to
hinterduce to your notice some pitchers of events in different parts of
the world.As each pitcher appears on the stage I will give a short
explanation of the subject, and afterwards the band will play a
suitable collection of appropriated music, consisting of hymns and all
the latest and most popular songs of the day, and the audience is
kindly requested to join in the chorus.'Our first scene,' continued Bert as he turned the handles and brought
the picture into view,'represents the docks at Southampton; the
magnificent steamer which you see lying alongside the shore is the ship
which is waiting to take us to foreign parts.As we have already paid
our fare, we will now go on board and set sail.'As an accompaniment to this picture Bert played the tune of 'Goodbye,
Dolly, I must leave you', and by the time the audience had  finished
singing the chorus he had rolled on another scene, which depicted a
dreadful storm at sea, with a large ship evidently on the point of
foundering.The waves were running mountains high and the inky clouds
were riven by forked lightning.To increase the terrifying effect,
Bert rattled the tea tray and played 'The Bay of Biscay', and the
children sung the chorus whilst he rolled the next picture into view.This scene showed the streets of a large city; mounted police with
drawn swords were dispersing a crowd: several men had been ridden down
and were being trampled under the hoofs of the horses, and a number of
others were bleeding profusely from wounds on the head and face.'After a rather stormy passage we arrives safely at the beautiful city
of Berlin, in Germany, just in time to see a procession of unemployed
workmen being charged by the military police.This picture is
hintitled "Tariff Reform means Work for All".'As an appropriate musical selection Bert played the tune of a
well-known song, and the children sang the words:

        'To be there!Oh, I knew what it was to be there!And when they tore me clothes,
        Blacked me eyes and broke me nose,
        Then I knew what it was to be there!'During the singing Bert turned the handles backwards and again brought
on the picture of the storm at sea.'As we don't want to get knocked on the 'ed, we clears out of Berlin as
soon as we can--whiles we're safe--and once more embarks on our gallint
ship' and after a few more turns of the 'andle we finds ourselves back
once more in Merry Hingland, where we see the inside of a blacksmith's
shop with a lot of half-starved women making iron chains.They work
seventy hours a week for seven shillings.Our next scene is hintitled
"The Hook and Eye Carders".'Ere we see the inside of a room in
Slumtown, with a mother and three children and the old grandmother
sewin' hooks and eyes on cards to be sold in drapers' shops.It ses
underneath the pitcher that 384 hooks and 384 eyes has to be joined
together and sewed on cards for one penny.'While this picture was being rolled away the band played and the
children sang with great enthusiasm:

        'Rule, Brittania, Brittania rules the waves!Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves!''Our next picture is called "An Englishman's Home".'Ere we see the
inside of another room in Slumtown, with the father and mother and four
children sitting down to dinner--bread and drippin' and tea.It ses
underneath the pitcher that there's Thirteen millions of people in
England always on the verge of starvation.These people that you see
in the pitcher might be able to get a better dinner than this if it
wasn't that most of the money wot the bloke earns 'as to pay the rent.Again we turns the 'andle and presently we comes to another very
beautiful scene--"Early Morning in Trafalgar Square".'Ere we see a
lot of Englishmen who have been sleepin' out all night because they
ain't got no 'omes to go to.'As a suitable selection for this picture, Bert played the tune of a
music-hall song, the words of which were familiar to all the
youngsters, who sang at the top of their voices:

        'I live in Trafalgar Square,
        With four lions to guard me,
        Pictures and statues all over the place,
        Lord Nelson staring me straight in the face,
        Of course it's rather draughty,
        But still I'm sure you'll agree,
        If it's good enough for Lord Nelson,
        It's quite good enough for me.''Next we 'ave a view of the dining-hall at the Topside Hotel in London,
where we see the tables set for a millionaires' banquet.The forks and
spoons is made of solid gold and the plates is made of silver.The
flowers that you see on the tables and 'angin' down from the ceilin'
and on the walls is worth L2,000 and it cost the bloke wot give the
supper over L30,000 for this one beano.A few more turns of the 'andle
shows us another glorious banquet--the King of Rhineland being
entertained by the people of England.Next we finds ourselves looking
on at the Lord Mayor's supper at the Mansion House.All the fat men
that you see sittin' at the tables is Liberal and Tory Members of
Parlimint.After this we 'ave a very beautiful pitcher hintitled "Four
footed Haristocrats".'Ere you see Lady Slumrent's pet dogs sittin' up
on chairs at their dinner table with white linen napkins tied round
their necks, eatin' orf silver plates like human people and being
waited on by real live waiters in hevening dress.Lady Slumrent is
very fond of her pretty pets and she does not allow them to be fed on
anything but the very best food; they gets chicken, rump steak, mutton
chops, rice pudding, jelly and custard.''I wished I was a pet dog, don't you?'remarked Tommy Newman to Charley
Linden.'Here we see another unemployed procession,' continued Bert as he
rolled another picture into sight; '2,000 able-bodied men who are not
allowed to work.Next we see the hinterior of a Hindustrial
'Ome--Blind children and <DW36>s working for their living.Our next
scene is called "Cheap Labour".'Ere we see a lot of small boys about
twelve and thirteen years old bein' served out with their Labour
Stifficats, which gives 'em the right to go to work and earn money to
help their unemployed fathers to pay the slum rent.'Once more we turns the 'andle and brings on one of our finest scenes.This lovely pitcher is hintitled "The Hangel of Charity", and shows us
the beautiful Lady Slumrent seated at the table in a cosy corner of 'er
charmin' boodore, writin' out a little cheque for the relief of the
poor of Slumtown.'Our next scene is called "The Rival Candidates, or, a Scene during the
General Election".On the left you will observe, standin' up in a
motor car, a swell bloke with a eyeglass stuck in one eye, and a
overcoat with a big fur collar and cuffs, addressing the crowd: this is
the Honourable Augustus Slumrent, the Conservative candidate.On the
other side of the road we see another motor car and another swell bloke
with a round pane of glass in one eye and a overcoat with a big fur
collar and cuffs, standing up in the car and addressin' the crowd.This
is Mr Mandriver, the Liberal candidate.The crowds of shabby-lookin'
chaps standin' round the motor cars wavin' their 'ats and cheerin' is
workin' men.Both the candidates is tellin' 'em the same old story,
and each of 'em is askin' the workin' men to elect 'im to Parlimint,
and promisin' to do something or other to make things better for the
lower horders.'As an appropriate selection to go with this picture, Bert played the
tune of a popular song, the words being well known to the children, who
sang enthusiastically, clapping their hands and stamping their feet on
the floor in time with the music:

        'We've both been there before,
        Many a time, many a time!We've both been there before,
        Many a time!To colour his nose and mine,
        We've both been there before,
        Many a time, many a time!'At the conclusion of the singing, Bert turned another picture into view.''Ere we 'ave another election scene.At each side we see the two
candidates the same as in the last pitcher.In the middle of the road
we see a man lying on the ground, covered with blood, with a lot of
Liberal and Tory working men kickin' 'im, jumpin' on 'im, and stampin'
on 'is face with their 'obnailed boots.The bloke on the ground is a
Socialist, and the reason why they're kickin' 'is face in is because 'e
said that the only difference between Slumrent and Mandriver was that
they was both alike.'While the audience were admiring this picture, Bert played another
well-known tune, and the children sang the words:

        'Two lovely black eyes,
        Oh what a surprise!Only for telling a man he was wrong,
        Two lovely black eyes.'Bert continued to turn the handles of the rollers and a long succession
of pictures passed across the stage, to the delight of the children,
who cheered and sang as occasion demanded, but the most enthusiastic
outburst of all greeted the appearance of the final picture, which was
a portrait of the King.Directly the children saw it--without waiting
for the band--they gave three cheers and began to sing the chorus of
the National Anthem.A round of applause for Bert concluded the Pandorama performance; the
lamp and the candles of the Christmas tree were relit--for although all
the toys had been taken off, the tree still made a fine show with the
shining glass ornaments--and then they had some more games; blind man's
buff, a tug-of-war--in which Philpot was defeated with great
laughter--and a lot of other games.And when they were tired of these,
each child'said a piece' or sung a song, learnt specially for the
occasion.The only one who had not come prepared in this respect was
little Rosie, and even she--so as to be the same as the
others--insisted on reciting the only piece she knew.Kneeling on the
hearthrug, she put her hands together, palm to palm, and shutting her
eyes very tightly she repeated the verse she always said every night
before going to bed:

        'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
        Look on me, a little child.Pity my simplicity,
        Suffer me to come to Thee.'Then she stood up and kissed everyone in turn, and Philpot crossed over
and began looking out of the window, and coughed, and blew his nose,
because a nut that he had been eating had gone down the wrong way.Most of them were by this time quite tired out, so after some supper
the party broke up.Although they were nearly all very sleepy, none of
them were very willing to go, but they were consoled by the thought of
another entertainment to which they were going later on in the
week--the Band of Hope Tea and Prize Distribution at the Shining Light
Chapel.Bert undertook to see Elsie and Charley safely home, and Philpot
volunteered to accompany Nellie and Tommy Newman, and to carry Rosie,
who was so tired that she fell asleep on his shoulder before they left
the house.As they were going down the stairs Frankie held a hurried consultation
with his mother, with the result that he was able to shout after them
an invitation to come again next Christmas.Chapter 30

The Brigands hold a Council of War


It being now what is usually called the festive season--possibly
because at this period of the year a greater number of people are
suffering from hunger and cold than at any other time--the reader will
not be surprised at being invited to another little party which took
place on the day after the one we have just left.The scene was Mr
Sweater's office.Mr Sweater was seated at his desk, but with his
chair swung round to enable him to face his guests--Messrs Rushton,
Didlum, and Grinder, who were also seated.'Something will 'ave to be done, and that very soon,' Grinder was
saying.'We can't go on much longer as we're doing at present.For my
part, I think the best thing to do is to chuck up the sponge at once;
the company is practically bankrupt now, and the longer we waits the
worser it will be.''That's just my opinion,' said Didlum dejectedly.'If we could supply
the electric light at the same price as gas, or a little cheaper, we
might have some chance; but we can't do it.The fact is that the
machinery we've got is no dam good; it's too small and it's wore out,
consequently the light we supply is inferior to gas and costs more.''Yes, I think we're fairly beaten this time,' said Rushton.'Why, even
if the Gas Coy hadn't moved their works beyond the borough boundary,
still we shouldn't 'ave been hable to compete with 'em.''The truth of the matter is just wot
Didlum says.Our machinery is too small, it's worn hout, and good for
nothing but to be throwed on the scrap-heap.So there's only one thing
left to do and that is--go into liquidation.''I don't see it,' remarked Sweater.'Well, what do you propose, then?'Pull down the works and
build fresh, and buy some new machinery?And then most likely not make
a do of it after all?You
won't catch me chuckin' good money after bad in that way.'remarked Didlum, very decidedly.'I'm not such a fool as to suggest anything
of that sort,' he said.'You seem to forget that I am one of the
largest shareholders myself.replied Grinder with a contemptuous laugh in which the
others joined.'Who's going to buy the shares of a concern that's
practically bankrupt and never paid a dividend?''I've tried to sell my little lot several times already,' said Didlum
with a sickly smile, 'but nobody won't buy 'em.'repeated Sweater, replying to Grinder.Why shouldn't Mugsborough go
in for Socialism as well as other towns?'Rushton, Didlum and Grinder fairly gasped for breath: the audacity of
the chief's proposal nearly paralysed them.'I'm afraid we should never git away with it,' ejaculated Didlum, as
soon as he could speak.'When the people tumbled to it, there'd be no
hend of a row.''The majority of the
people will never know anything about it!Listen to me--'

'Are you quite sure as we can't be over'eard?'interrupted Rushton,
glancing nervously at the door and round the office.'It's all right,' answered Sweater, who nevertheless lowered his voice
almost to a whisper, and the others drew their chairs closer and bent
forward to listen.'You know we still have a little money in hand: well, what I propose is
this: At the annual meeting, which, as you know, comes off next week,
we'll arrange for the Secretary to read a highly satisfactory report,
and we'll declare a dividend of 15 per cent--we can arrange it somehow
between us.Of course, we'll have to cook the accounts a little, but
I'll see that it's done properly.The other shareholders are not going
to ask any awkward questions, and we all understand each other.'Sweater paused, and regarded the other three brigands intently.'Yes, yes,' said Didlum eagerly.And Rushton and
Grinder nodded assent.'Afterwards,' resumed Sweater, 'I'll arrange for a good report of the
meeting to appear in the Weekly Ananias.I'll instruct the Editor to
write it himself, and I'll tell him just what to say.I'll also get
him to write a leading article about it, saying that electricity is
sure to supersede gas for lighting purposes in the very near future.Then the article will go on to refer to the huge profits made by the
Gas Coy and to say how much better it would have been if the town had
bought the gasworks years ago, so that those profits might have been
used to reduce the rates, the same as has been done in other towns.Finally, the article will declare that it's a great pity that the
Electric Light Supply should be in the hands of a private company, and
to suggest that an effort be made to acquire it for the town.'In the meantime we can all go about--in a very quiet and judicious
way, of course--bragging about what a good thing we've got, and saying
we don't mean to sell.We shall say that we've overcome all the
initial expenses and difficulties connected with the installation of
the works--that we are only just beginning to reap the reward of our
industry and enterprise, and so on.'Then,' continued the Chief, 'we can arrange for it to be proposed in
the Council that the Town should purchase the Electric Light Works.''But not by one of us four, you know,' said Grinder with a cunning leer.'Certainly not; that would give the show away at once.There are, as
you know--several members of the Band who are not shareholders in the
company; we'll get some of them to do most of the talking.We, being
the directors of the company, must pretend to be against selling, and
stick out for our own price; and when we do finally consent we must
make out that we are sacrificing our private interests for the good of
the Town.We'll get a committee appointed--we'll have an expert
engineer down from London--I know a man that will suit our purpose
admirably--we'll pay him a trifle and he'll say whatever we tell him
to--and we'll rush the whole business through before you can say "Jack
Robinson", and before the rate-payers have time to realize what's being
done.Not that we need worry ourselves much about them.Most of them
take no interest in public affairs, but even if there is something
said, it won't matter much to us once we've got the money.It'll be a
nine days' wonder and then we'll hear no more of it.'As the Chief ceased speaking, the other brigands also remained silent,
speechless with admiration of his cleverness.'Well, what do you think of it?''I think it's
splendid!If we can honly git away with it,
I reckon it'll be one of the smartest thing we've ever done.''Smart ain't the word for it,' observed Rushton.'There's no doubt it's a grand idear!'exclaimed Didlum, 'and I've just
thought of something else that might be done to help it along.We could
arrange to 'ave a lot of letters sent "To the Editor of the Obscurer"
and "To the Editor of the Ananias," and "To the Editor of the Weekly
Chloroform" in favour of the scheme.''Yes, that's a very good idea,' said Grinder.'For that matter the
editors could write them to themselves and sign them "Progress",
"Ratepayer", "Advance Mugsborough", and sich-like.''Yes, that's all right,' said the Chief, thoughtfully, 'but we must be
careful not to overdo it; of course there will have to be a certain
amount of publicity, but we don't want to create too much interest in
it.''Come to think of it,' observed Rushton arrogantly, 'why should we
trouble ourselves about the opinion of the ratepayers at all?Why
should we trouble to fake the books, or declare a dividend or 'ave the
harticles in the papers or anything else?We've got the game in our
own 'ands; we've got a majority in the Council, and, as Mr Sweater ses,
very few people even take the trouble to read the reports of the
meetings.''Yes, that's right enough,' said Grinder.'But it's just them few wot
would make a lot of trouble and talk; THEY'RE the very people we 'as to
think about.If we can only manage to put THEM in a fog we'll be all
right, and the way to do it is as Mr Sweater proposes.''Yes, I think so,' said the Chief.I can
work it all right in the Ananias and the Chloroform, and of course
you'll see that the Obscurer backs us up.''I'll take care of that,' said Grinder, grimly.The three local papers were run by limited companies.Sweater held
nearly all the shares of the Ananias and of the Weekly Chloroform, and
controlled their policy and contents.Grinder occupied the same
position with regard to the Obscurer.The editors were a sort of
marionettes who danced as Sweater and Grinder pulled the strings.'I wonder how Dr Weakling will take it?''That's the very thing I was just thinkin' about,' cried Didlum.'Don't
you think it would be a good plan if we could arrange to 'ave somebody
took bad--you know, fall down in a fit or something in the street just
outside the Town 'All just before the matter is brought forward in the
Council, and then 'ave someone to come and call 'im out to attend to
the party wot's ill, and keep 'im out till the business is done.''Yes, that's a capital idear,' said Grinder thoughtfully.'But who
could we get to 'ave the fit?It would 'ave to be someone we could
trust, you know.'You wouldn't mind doin' it, would yer?''I should strongly object,' said Rushton haughtily.He regarded the
suggestion that he should act such an undignified part, as a kind of
sacrilege.'Then I'll do it meself if necessary,' said Didlum.'I'm not proud
when there's money to be made; anything for an honest living.''Well, I think we're all agreed, so far,' remarked Sweater.'And I think we all deserve a drink,' the Chief continued, producing a
decanter and a box of cigars from a cupboard by the side of his desk.'Pass that water bottle from behind you, Didlum.''I suppose nobody won't be comin' in?''I'm
a teetotaler, you know.''Oh, it's all right,' said Sweater, taking four glasses out of the
cupboard and pouring out the whisky.'I've given orders that we're not
to be disturbed for anyone.'Well, 'ere's success to Socialism,' cried Grinder, raising his glass,
and taking a big drink.'Amen--'ear, 'ear, I mean,' said Didlum, hastily correcting himself.'Wot I likes about this 'ere business is that we're not only doin'
ourselves a bit of good,' continued Grinder with a laugh, 'we're not
only doin' ourselves a bit of good, but we're likewise doin' the
Socialists a lot of 'arm.When the ratepayers 'ave bought the Works,
and they begins to kick up a row because they're losin' money over
it--we can tell 'em that it's Socialism!And then they'll say that if
that's Socialism they don't want no more of it.'The other brigands laughed gleefully, and some of Didlum's whisky went
down the wrong way and nearly sent him into a fit.'You might as well kill a man at once,' he protested as he wiped the
tears from his eyes, 'you might as well kill a man at once as choke 'im
to death.''And now I've got a bit of good news for you,' said the Chief as he put
his empty glass down.'Although we've had a very rough time of it in our contest with the
Gasworks Company, and although we've got the worst of it, it hasn't
been all lavender for them, you know.They've not enjoyed themselves
either: we hit them pretty hard when we put up the coal dues.''A damn good job too,' said Grinder malignantly.'Well,' continued Sweater, 'they're just as sick of the fight as they
want to be, because of course they don't know exactly how badly we've
been hit.For all they know, we could have continued the struggle
indefinitely: and--well, to make a long story short, I've had a talk
with the managing director and one or two others, and they're willing
to let us in with them.So that we can put the money we get for the
Electric Light Works into gas shares!'This was such splendid news that they had another drink on the strength
of it, and Didlum said that one of the first things they would have to
do would be to totally abolish the Coal Dues, because they pressed so
hard on the poor.Chapter 31

The Deserter


About the end of January, Slyme left Easton's.The latter had not
succeeded in getting anything to do since the work at 'The Cave' was
finished, and latterly the quality of the food had been falling off.The twelve shillings Slyme paid for his board and lodging was all that
Ruth had to keep house with.She had tried to get some work to do
herself, but generally without success; there were one or two jobs that
she might have had if she had been able to give her whole time to them,
but of course that was not possible; the child and the housework had to
be attended to, and Slyme's meals had to be prepared.Nevertheless, she
contrived to get away several times when she had a chance of earning a
few shillings by doing a day's charing for some lady or other, and then
she left everything in such order at home that Easton was able to
manage all right while she was away.On these occasions, she usually
left the baby with Owen's wife, who was an old schoolmate of hers.Nora was the more willing to render her this service because Frankie
used to be so highly delighted whenever it happened.He never tired of
playing with the child, and for several days afterwards he used to
worry his mother with entreaties to buy a baby of their own.Easton earned a few shillings occasionally; now and then he got a job
to clean windows, and once or twice he did a few days' or hours' work
with some other painter who had been fortunate enough to get a little
job 'on his own'--such as a ceiling to wash and whiten, or a room or
two to paint; but such jobs were few.Sometimes, when they were very hard up, they sold something; the Bible
that used to lie on the little table in the bay window was one of the
first things to be parted with.Ruth erased the inscription from the
fly-leaf and then they sold the book at a second-hand shop for two
shillings.As time went on, they sold nearly everything that was
saleable, except of course, the things that were obtained on the hire
system.Slyme could see that they were getting very much into debt and behind
with the rent, and on two occasions already Easton had borrowed five
shillings from him, which he might never be able to pay back.Another
thing was that Slyme was always in fear that Ruth--who had never wholly
abandoned herself to wrongdoing--might tell Easton what had happened;
more than once she had talked of doing so, and the principal reason why
she refrained was that she knew that even if he forgave her, he could
never think the same of her as before.Slyme repeatedly urged this
view upon her, pointing out that no good could result from such a
confession.Latterly the house had become very uncomfortable.It was not only that
the food was bad and that sometimes there was no fire, but Ruth and
Easton were nearly always quarrelling about something or other.She
scarcely spoke to Slyme at all, and avoided sitting at the table with
him whenever possible.He was in constant dread that Easton might
notice her manner towards him, and seek for some explanation.Altogether the situation was so unpleasant that Slyme determined to
clear out.He made the excuse that he had been offered a few weeks'
work at a place some little distance outside the town.After he was
gone they lived for several weeks in semi-starvation on what credit
they could get and by selling the furniture or anything else they
possessed that could be turned into money.The things out of Slyme's
room were sold almost directly he left.Chapter 32

The Veteran


Old Jack Linden had tried hard to earn a little money by selling
bloaters, but they often went bad, and even when he managed to sell
them all the profit was so slight that it was not worth doing.Before the work at 'The Cave' was finished, Philpot was a good friend
to them; he frequently gave old Jack sixpence or a shilling and often
brought a bag of cakes or buns for the children.Sometimes he came to
tea with them on Sundays as an excuse for bringing a tin of salmon.Elsie and Charley frequently went to Owen's house to take tea with
Frankie; in fact, whilst Owen had anything to do, they almost lived
there, for both Owen and Nora, knowing that the Lindens had nothing to
live on except the earnings of the young woman, encouraged the children
to come often.Old Jack made some hopeless attempts to get work--work of any kind, but
nobody wanted him; and to make things worse, his eyesight, which had
been failing for a long time, became very bad.Once he was given a job
by a big provision firm to carry an advertisement about the streets.The man who had been carrying it before--an old soldier--had been
sacked the previous day for getting drunk while on duty.The
advertisement was not an ordinary pair of sandwich boards, but a sort
of box without any bottom or lid, a wooden frame, four sides covered
with canvas, on which were pasted printed bills advertising margarine.Each side of this box or frame was rather larger than an ordinary
sandwich board.Old Linden had to get inside this thing and carry it about the streets;
two straps fixed across the top of the frame and passing one over each
of his shoulders enabled him to carry it.It swayed about a good deal
as he walked along, especially when the wind caught it, but there were
two handles inside to hold it steady by.The pay was eighteenpence a
day, and he had to travel a certain route, up and down the busiest
streets.At first the frame did not feel very heavy, but the weight seemed to
increase as the time went on, and the straps hurt his shoulders.He
felt very much ashamed, also, whenever he encountered any of his old
mates, some of whom laughed at him.In consequence of the frame requiring so much attention to keep it
steady, and being unused to the work, and his sight so bad, he several
times narrowly escaped being run over.Another thing that added to his
embarrassment was the jeering of the other sandwichmen, the loafers
outside the public houses, and the boys, who shouted 'old Jack in the
box' after him.Sometimes the boys threw refuse at the frame, and once
a decayed orange thrown by one of them knocked his hat off.By the time evening came he was scarcely able to stand for weariness.His shoulders, his legs and his feet ached terribly, and as he was
taking the thing back to the shop he was accosted by a ragged,
dirty-looking, beer-sodden old man whose face was inflamed with drink
and fury.'This was the old soldier who had been discharged the
previous day.He cursed and swore in the most awful manner and accused
Linden of 'taking the bread out of his mouth', and, shaking his fist
fiercely at him, shouted that he had a good mind to knock his face
through his head and out of the back of his neck.He might possibly
have tried to put this threat into practice but for the timely
appearance of a policeman, when he calmed down at once and took himself
off.Jack did not go back the next day; he felt that he would rather starve
than have any more of the advertisement frame, and after this he seemed
to abandon all hope of earning money: wherever he went it was the
same--no one wanted him.So he just wandered about the streets
aimlessly, now and then meeting an old workmate who asked him to have a
drink, but this was not often, for nearly all of them were out of work
and penniless.Chapter 33

The Soldier's Children


During most of this time, Jack Linden's daughter-in-law had 'Plenty of
Work', making blouses and pinafores for Sweater & Co.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.She had so much
to do that one might have thought that the Tory Millennium had arrived,
and that Tariff Reform was already an accomplished fact.At first they had employed her exclusively on the cheapest kind of
blouses--those that were paid for at the rate of two shillings a dozen,
but they did not give her many of that sort now.She did the work so
neatly that they kept her busy on the better qualities, which did not
pay her so well, because although she was paid more per dozen, there
was a great deal more work in them than in the cheaper kinds.Once she
had a very special one to make, for which she was paid six shillings;
but it took her four and a half days--working early and late--to do it.The lady who bought this blouse was told that it came from Paris, and
paid three guineas for it.But of course Mrs Linden knew nothing of
that, and even if she had known, it would have made no difference to
her.Most of the money she earned went to pay the rent, and sometimes there
was only two or three shillings left to buy food for all of them:
sometimes not even so much, because although she had Plenty of Work she
was not always able to do it.There were times when the strain of
working the machine was unendurable: her shoulders ached, her arms
became cramped, and her eyes pained so that it was impossible to
continue.Then for a change she would leave the sewing and do some
housework.Once, when they owed four weeks' rent, the agent was so threatening
that they were terrified at the thought of being sold up and turned out
of the house, and so she decided to sell the round mahogany table and
some of the other things out of the sitting-room.Nearly all the
furniture that was in the house now belonged to her, and had formed her
home before her husband died.The old people had given most of their
things away at different times to their other sons since she had come
to live there.These men were all married and all in employment.One
was a fitter at the gasworks; the second was a railway porter, and the
other was a butcher; but now that the old man was out of work they
seldom came to the house.The last time they had been there was on
Christmas Eve, and then there had been such a terrible row between them
that the children had been awakened by it and frightened nearly out of
their lives.The cause of the row was that some time previously they
had mutually agreed to each give a shilling a week to the old people.They had done this for three weeks and after that the butcher had
stopped his contribution: it had occurred to him that he was not to be
expected to help to keep his brother's widow and her children.If the
old people liked to give up the house and go to live in a room
somewhere by themselves, he would continue paying his shilling a week,
but not otherwise.Upon this the railway porter and the gas-fitter
also ceased paying.They said it wasn't fair that they should pay a
shilling a week each when the butcher--who was the eldest and earned
the best wages--paid nothing.Provided he paid, they would pay; but if
he didn't pay anything, neither would they.On Christmas Eve they all
happened to come to the house at the same time; each denounced the
others, and after nearly coming to blows they all went away raging and
cursing and had not been near the place since.As soon as she decided to sell the things, Mary went to Didlum's
second-hand furniture store, and the manager said he would ask Mr
Didlum to call and see the table and other articles.She waited
anxiously all the morning, but he did not appear, so she went once more
to the shop to remind him.When he did come at last he was very
contemptuous of the table and of everything else she offered to sell.Five shillings was the very most he could think of giving for the
table, and even then he doubted whether he would ever get his money
back.Eventually he gave her thirty shillings for the table, the
overmantel, the easy chair, three other chairs and the two best
pictures--one a large steel engraving of 'The Good Samaritan' and the
other 'Christ Blessing Little Children'.He paid the money at once; half an hour afterwards the van came to take
the things away, and when they were gone, Mary sank down on the
hearthrug in the wrecked room and sobbed as if her heart would break.Slowly, piece by
piece, in order to buy food and to pay the rent, the furniture was
sold.Every time Didlum came he affected to be doing them a very great
favour by buying the things at all.Business was so bad: it might be years before he could
sell them again, and so on.Once or twice he asked Mary if she did not
want to sell the clock--the one that her late husband had made for his
mother, but Mary shrank from the thought of selling this, until at last
there was nothing else left that Didlum would buy, and one week, when
Mary was too ill to do any needlework--it had to go.He gave them ten
shillings for it.Mary had expected the old woman to be heartbroken at having to part
with this clock, but she was surprised to see her almost indifferent.The truth was, that lately both the old people seemed stunned, and
incapable of taking an intelligent interest in what was happening
around them, and Mary had to attend to everything.From time to time nearly all their other possessions--things of
inferior value that Didlum would not look at, she carried out and sold
at small second-hand shops in back streets or pledged at the
pawn-broker's.The feather pillows, sheets, and blankets: bits of
carpet or oilcloth, and as much of their clothing as was saleable or
pawnable.They felt the loss of the bedclothes more than anything
else, for although all the clothes they wore during the day, and all
the old clothes and dresses in the house, and even an old 
tablecloth, were put on the beds at night, they did not compensate for
the blankets, and they were often unable to sleep on account of the
intense cold.A lady district visitor who called occasionally sometimes gave Mary an
order for a hundredweight of coal or a shillingsworth of groceries, or
a ticket for a quart of soup, which Elsie fetched in the evening from
the Soup Kitchen.But this was not very often, because, as the lady
said, there were so many cases similar to theirs that it was impossible
to do more than a very little for any one of them.Sometimes Mary became so weak and exhausted through overwork, worry,
and lack of proper food that she broke down altogether for the time
being, and positively could not do any work at all.Then she used to
lie down on the bed in her room and cry.Whenever she became like this, Elsie and Charley used to do the
housework when they came home from school, and make tea and toast for
her, and bring it to the bedside on a chair so that she could eat lying
down.When there was no margarine or dripping to put on the toast,
they made it very thin and crisp and pretended it was biscuit.The children rather enjoyed these times; the quiet and leisure was so
different from other days when their mother was so busy she had no time
to speak to them.They would sit on the side of the bed, the old grandmother in her chair
opposite with the cat beside her listening to the conversation and
purring or mewing whenever they stroked it or spoke to it.They talked
principally of the future.Elsie said she was going to be a teacher
and earn a lot of money to bring home to her mother to buy things with.Charley was thinking of opening a grocer's shop and having a horse and
cart.When one has a grocer's shop, there is always plenty to eat;
even if you have no money, you can take as much as you like out of your
shop--good stuff, too, tins of salmon, jam, sardines, eggs, cakes,
biscuits and all those sorts of things--and one was almost certain to
have some money every day, because it wasn't likely that a whole day
would go by without someone or other coming into the shop to buy
something.When delivering the groceries with the horse and cart, he
would give rides to all the boys he knew, and in the summertime, after
the work was done and the shop shut up, Mother and Elsie and Granny
could also come for long rides into the country.The old grandmother--who had latterly become quite childish--used to
sit and listen to all this talk with a superior air.Sometimes she
argued with the children about their plans, and ridiculed them.She
used to say with a chuckle that she had heard people talk like that
before--lots of times--but it never came to nothing in the end.One week about the middle of February, when they were in very sore
straits indeed, old Jack applied to the secretary of the Organized
Benevolence Society for assistance.It was about eleven o'clock in the
morning when he turned the corner of the street where the office of the
society was situated and saw a crowd of about thirty men waiting for
the doors to be opened in order to apply for soup tickets.Some of
these men were of the tramp or the drunken loafer class; some were old,
broken-down workmen like himself, and others were labourers wearing
corduroy or moleskin trousers with straps round their legs under their
knees.Linden waited at a distance until all these were gone before he went
in.The secretary received him sympathetically and gave him a big form
to fill up, but as Linden's eyes were so bad and his hand so unsteady
the secretary very obligingly wrote in the answers himself, and
informed him that he would inquire into the case and lay his
application before the committee at the next meeting, which was to be
held on the following Thursday--it was then Monday.Linden explained to him that they were actually starving.He had been
out of work for sixteen weeks, and during all that time they had lived
for the most part on the earnings of his daughter-in-law, but she had
not done anything for nearly a fortnight now, because the firm she
worked for had not had any work for her to do.There was no food in
the house and the children were crying for something to eat.All last
week they had been going to school hungry, for they had had nothing but
dry bread and tea every day: but this week--as far as he could
see--they would not get even that.After some further talk the
secretary gave him two soup tickets and an order for a loaf of bread,
and repeated his promise to inquire into the case and bring it before
the committee.As Jack was returning home he passed the Soup Kitchen, where he saw the
same lot of men who had been to the office of the Organized Benevolence
Society for the soup tickets.They were waiting in a long line to be
admitted.The premises being so small, the proprietor served them in
batches of ten at a time.On Wednesday the secretary called at the house, and on Friday Jack
received a letter from him to the effect that the case had been duly
considered by the committee, who had come to the conclusion that as it
was a 'chronic' case they were unable to deal with it, and advised him
to apply to the Board of Guardians.This was what Linden had hitherto
shrunk from doing, but the situation was desperate.They owed five
weeks' rent, and to crown their misfortune his eyesight had become so
bad that even if there had been any prospect of obtaining work it was
very doubtful if he could have managed to do it.So Linden, feeling
utterly crushed and degraded, swallowed all that remained of his pride
and went like a beaten dog to see the relieving officer, who took him
before the Board, who did not think it a suitable case for out-relief,
and after some preliminaries it was arranged that Linden and his wife
were to go into the workhouse, and Mary was to be allowed three
shillings a week to help her to support herself and the two children.As for Linden's sons, the Guardians intimated their Intention of
compelling them to contribute towards the cost of their parents'
maintenance.Mary accompanied the old people to the gates of their future
dwelling-place, and when she returned home she found there a letter
addressed to J. Linden.It was from the house agent and contained a
notice to leave the house before the end of the ensuing week.Nothing
was said about the rent that was due.Perhaps Mr Sweater thought that
as he had already received nearly six hundred pounds in rent from
Linden he could afford to be generous about the five weeks that were
still owing--or perhaps he thought there was no possibility of getting
the money.However that may have been, there was no reference to it in
the letter--it was simply a notice to clear out, addressed to Linden,
but meant for Mary.It was about half past three o'clock in the afternoon when she returned
home and found this letter on the floor in the front passage.She was
faint with fatigue and hunger, for she had had nothing but a cup of tea
and a slice of bread that day, and her fare had not been much better
for many weeks past.The children were at school, and the house--now
almost destitute of furniture and without carpets or oilcloth on the
floors--was deserted and cold and silent as a tomb.On the kitchen
table were a few cracked cups and saucers, a broken knife, some lead
teaspoons, a part of a loaf, a small basin containing some dripping and
a brown earthenware teapot with a broken spout.Near the table were two
broken kitchen chairs, one with the top cross-piece gone from the back,
and the other with no back to the seat at all.The bareness of the
walls was relieved only by a  almanac and some paper pictures
which the children had tacked upon them, and by the side of the
fireplace was the empty wicker chair where the old woman used to sit.There was no fire in the grate, and the cold hearth was untidy with an
accumulation of ashes, for during the trouble of these last few days
she had not had time or heart to do any housework.The floor was
unswept and littered with scraps of paper and dust: in one corner was a
heap of twigs and small branches of trees that Charley had found
somewhere and brought home for the fire.The same disorder prevailed all through the house: all the doors were
open, and from where she stood in the kitchen she could see the bed she
shared with Elsie, with its heterogeneous heap of coverings.The
sitting-room contained nothing but a collection of odds and ends of
rubbish which belonged to Charley--his 'things' as he called them--bits
of wood, string and rope; one wheel of a perambulator, a top, an iron
hoop and so on.Through the other door was visible the dilapidated
bedstead that had been used by the old people, with a similar lot of
bedclothes to those on her own bed, and the torn, ragged covering of
the mattress through the side of which the flock was protruding and
falling in particles on to the floor.As she stood there with the letter in her hand--faint and weary in the
midst of all this desolation, it seemed to her as if the whole world
were falling to pieces and crumbling away all around her.Chapter 34

The Beginning of the End


During the months of January and February, Owen, Crass, Slyme and
Sawkins continued to work at irregular intervals for Rushton & Co.,
although--even when there was anything to do--they now put in only six
hours a day, commencing in the morning and leaving off at four, with an
hour's interval for dinner between twelve and one.They finished the
'plant' and painted the front of Rushton's shop.When all this was
completed, as no other work came in, they all had to'stand off' with
the exception of Sawkins, who was kept on because he was cheap and able
to do all sorts of odd jobs, such as unstopping drains, repairing leaky
roofs, rough painting or lime-washing, and he was also useful as a
labourer for the plumbers, of whom there were now three employed at
Rushton's, the severe weather which had come in with January having
made a lot of work in that trade.With the exception of this one
branch, practically all work was at a standstill.had had several 'boxing-up' jobs to do,
and Crass always did the polishing of the coffins on these occasions,
besides assisting to take the 'box' home when finished and to 'lift in'
the corpse, and afterwards he always acted as one of the bearers at the
funerals.For an ordinary class funeral he usually put in about three
hours for the polishing; that came to one and nine.Taking home the
coffin and lifting in the corpse, one shilling--usually there were two
men to do this besides Hunter, who always accompanied them to
superintend the work--attending the funeral and acting as bearer, four
shillings: so that altogether Crass made six shillings and ninepence
out of each funeral, and sometimes a little more.For instance, when
there was an unusually good-class corpse they had a double coffin and
then of course there were two 'lifts in', for the shell was taken home
first and the outer coffin perhaps a day or two later: this made
another shilling.No matter how expensive the funeral was, the bearers
never got any more money.Sometimes the carpenter and Crass were able
to charge an hour or two more on the making and polishing of a coffin
for a good job, but that was all.Sometimes, when there was a very
cheap job, they were paid only three shillings
