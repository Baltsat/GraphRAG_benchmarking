The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

On the night of the 7th of April we camped on Buffalo River.Moving at an
early hour on the 8th, we crossed the Lynchburg Railroad at Prospect
Station, and headed for Appomattox Station, where it was expected we would
strike, if not intercept, Lee's retreating, disintegrating army.The trail
was fresh and the chase hot.Joy beamed in every eye, for all felt that
the end was drawing near, and we earnestly hoped that ours might be the
glorious opportunity of striking the final blow.About noon the regiment
was detached to capture a force of the enemy said to be at one of the
crossings of the Appomattox.Some few hundreds, unarmed, half-starved,
stragglers, with no fight in them, were found, and turned over to the
Provost Marshall.Resuming its place in the column, I received orders to
report with the regiment to General Custer, who was at its head.Reporting
in compliance with this order, General Custer informed me that his scouts
had reported three large trains of cars at Appomattox Station, loaded with
supplies for the rebel army; that he expected to have made a junction
with Merritt's division near this point; that his orders were to wait here
till Merritt joined him; that he had not heard from him since morning, and
had sent an officer to communicate with him, but if he did not hear from
him in half an hour, he wished me to take my regiment and capture the
trains of cars, and, if possible, reach and hold the pike to Lynchburg.While talking, the whistle of the locomotive was distinctly but faintly
heard, and the column was at once moved forward, the Second New York in
advance.As we neared the station the whistles became more and more
distinct, and a scout reported the trains rapidly unloading, and that the
advance of the rebel army was passing through Appomattox Court House.Although Custer's orders were to make a junction with Merritt before
coming in contact with the enemy, here was a chance to strike a decisive
blow, which, if successful, would add to his renown and glory, and if not,
Merritt would soon be up to help him out of the scrape.Our excitement was
intense, but subdued.All saw the vital importance of heading off the
enemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the
question.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the
trains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my
shoulder, said, "Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is
the chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you."The regiment
left the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we
caught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a
cheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three
trains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and
firemen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men
around me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered
the trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were
claimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with
commissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the
rebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly
down on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a
fierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did
but little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by
a dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel
Pennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily
skirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily
constructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which
immense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was
ordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's
lines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest
of the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then
Custer, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and
charge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without
organization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and
everywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize
was so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel
infantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and
destruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so
as soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,
only to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting
would not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the
offensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I
went to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would
let me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He
excitedly replied, "Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything
you can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold
of the pike to-night."Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by
me, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other
regiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge
down a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery
was posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright
lights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot
swept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The
line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.The
division was commanded by General George A. Custer; the brigade by A. C.
M. Pennington, Captain Second United States Artillery, Colonel Third New
Jersey Cavalry.On the 27th of February, 1865, the divisions of Merritt
and Custer, with the batteries of Miller (Fourth United States Artillery)
and Woodruff (Second United States Artillery), all under command of
General Sheridan, left their winter quarters in and around Winchester,
and, after a series of splendid victories, and unsurpassed marches and
fortunes, joined the Army of the Potomac in front of Petersburg on the
27th of March.The Second New York Cavalry shared largely in the glories
and miseries of this great and successful raid.At Five Forks, Deep Creek,
and Sailors Creek, it not only maintained its gallant and meritorious
record, but added to its great renown.At the gentle and joyous passage
of arms at Appomattox Station, on the 8th of April, it reached the climax
of its glory, and, by its deeds of daring, touched the pinnacle of fame.On that day it performed prodigies of valor, and achieved successes as
pregnant with good results as any single action of the war.By forcing a
passage through the rebel lines and heading off Lee's army, it contributed
largely to the result that followed the next day--the surrender of the
Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.*       *       *       *       *

buy this beautiful book.MILLAIS' drawings are wonderfully delicate,
and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate.He has a fine touch for
plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and resolute
bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own peculiar
haunts.I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr.MILLAIS in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr.Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him.MILLAIS will consider the matter in his third edition.*       *       *       *       *

    Sang "Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"great slogger, pray what are you at,
    Singing 'Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow'?Is it lowness of average, batsman," I cried;
  "Or a bad 'brace of ducks' that has lowered your pride?"With a low-muttered swear-word or two he replied,
    "Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"He said "In the mud one can't score, anyhow,
    Singing willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!The people are raising a deuce of a row,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!I've been waiting all day in these flannels--they're damp!--
  The spectators impatiently shout, shriek, and stamp,
  But a batsman, you see, cannot play with a Gamp,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"Now I feel just as sure as I am that my name
    Isn't willow, wet-willow, wet-willow,
  The people will swear that I don't play the game,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!My spirits are low and my scores are not high,
  But day after day we've soaked turf and grey sky,
  And I shan't have a chance till the wickets get dry,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!!!"*       *       *       *       *

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the
country.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *

TO DOROTHY.(_My Four-year-old Sweetheart._)

  To make sweet hay I was amazed to find
    You absolutely did not know the way,
  Though when you did, it seemed much to your mind
                  To make sweet hay.You were kind
  Enough to answer, "Why, _of course_, you may."I kissed your pretty face with hay entwined,
  We made sweet hay.But what will Mother say
    If in a dozen years we're still inclined
                  To make sweet hay?*       *       *       *       *

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.About noon the regiment
was detached to capture a force of the enemy said to be at one of the
crossings of the Appomattox.Some few hundreds, unarmed, half-starved,
stragglers, with no fight in them, were found, and turned over to the
Provost Marshall.Resuming its place in the column, I received orders to
report with the regiment to General Custer, who was at its head.Reporting
in compliance with this order, General Custer informed me that his scouts
had reported three large trains of cars at Appomattox Station, loaded with
supplies for the rebel army; that he expected to have made a junction
with Merritt's division near this point; that his orders were to wait here
till Merritt joined him; that he had not heard from him since morning, and
had sent an officer to communicate with him, but if he did not hear from
him in half an hour, he wished me to take my regiment and capture the
trains of cars, and, if possible, reach and hold the pike to Lynchburg.While talking, the whistle of the locomotive was distinctly but faintly
heard, and the column was at once moved forward, the Second New York in
advance.As we neared the station the whistles became more and more
distinct, and a scout reported the trains rapidly unloading, and that the
advance of the rebel army was passing through Appomattox Court House.Although Custer's orders were to make a junction with Merritt before
coming in contact with the enemy, here was a chance to strike a decisive
blow, which, if successful, would add to his renown and glory, and if not,
Merritt would soon be up to help him out of the scrape.Our excitement was
intense, but subdued.All saw the vital importance of heading off the
enemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the
question.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the
trains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my
shoulder, said, "Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is
the chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you."The regiment
left the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we
caught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a
cheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three
trains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and
firemen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men
around me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered
the trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were
claimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with
commissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the
rebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly
down on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a
fierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did
but little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by
a dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel
Pennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily
skirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily
constructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which
immense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was
ordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's
lines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest
of the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then
Custer, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and
charge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without
organization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and
everywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize
was so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel
infantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and
destruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so
as soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,
only to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting
would not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the
offensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I
went to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would
let me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He
excitedly replied, "Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything
you can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold
of the pike to-night."Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by
me, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other
regiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge
down a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery
was posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright
lights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot
swept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The
line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.[17]
    With anxious eye he wander'd o'er
    Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,
    And ponder'd refuge from his toil,
    By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.But nearer was the copsewood gray,
    That waved and wept on Loch Achray,
    And mingled with the pine trees blue
    On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.Fresh vigor with the hope return'd,
    With flying foot the heath he spurn'd,
    Held westward with unwearied race,
    And left behind the panting chase.[17] Or Monteith, a picturesque district of Scotland watered by the
river Teith.'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,
    As swept the hunt through Cambus-more;[18]
    What reins were tighten'd in despair,
    When rose Benledi's ridge in air;
    Who flagg'd upon Bochastle's heath,
    Who shunn'd to stem the flooded Teith,--
    For twice that day, from shore to shore,
    The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.Few were the stragglers, following far,
    That reach'd the lake of Vennachar;
    And when the Brigg[19] of Turk was won,
    The headmost horseman rode alone.[18] An estate about two miles from Callander on the wooded banks of
the Keltie.Alone, but with unbated zeal,
    That horseman plied the scourge and steel;[20]
    For jaded now, and spent with toil,
    Emboss'd with foam, and dark with soil,
    While every gasp with sobs he drew,
    The laboring stag strain'd full in view.Hubert's breed,
    Unmatch'd for courage, breath, and speed,
    Fast on his flying traces came,
    And all but won that desperate game;
    For, scarce a spear's length from his haunch,
    Vindictive toil'd the bloodhounds stanch,
    Nor nearer might the dogs attain,
    Nor farther might the quarry strain.Thus up the margin of the lake,
    Between the precipice and brake,[21]
    O'er stock[22] and rock their race they take.The Hunter mark'd that mountain[23] high,
    The lone lake's western boundary,
    And deem'd the stag must turn to bay,[24]
    Where that huge rampart barr'd the way;
    Already glorying in the prize,
    Measured his antlers with his eyes;
    For the death wound and death halloo,
    Muster'd his breath, his whinyard drew;--
    But thundering as he came prepared,
    With ready arm and weapon bared,
    The wily quarry shunn'd the shock,
    And turn'd him from the opposing rock;
    Then, dashing down a darksome glen,
    Soon lost to hound and Hunter's ken,
    In the deep Trosachs'[25] wildest nook
    His solitary refuge took.There, while close couch'd, the thicket shed
    Cold dews and wild flowers on his head,
    He heard the baffled dogs in vain
    Rave through the hollow pass amain,
    Chiding the rocks that yell'd[26] again.[24] "Turn to bay," i.e., to face an antagonist, when escape is no
longer possible.[25] "The Trosachs" is the name now applied to the valley between Lochs
Katrine and Achray.[26] Echoed back their barks or chidings.Close on the hounds the Hunter came,
    To cheer them on the vanish'd game;
    But, stumbling on[27] the rugged dell,
    The gallant horse exhausted fell.The impatient rider strove in vain
    To rouse him with the spur and rein,
    For the good steed, his labors o'er,
    Stretch'd his stiff limbs, to rise no more;
    Then, touch'd with pity and remorse,
    He sorrow'd o'er the expiring horse."I little thought, when first thy rein
    I slack'd upon the banks of Seine,[28]
    That Highland eagle e'er should feed
    On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!Woe worth[29] the chase, woe worth the day,
    That costs thy life, my gallant gray!"[28] The river which flows through Paris, France.[29] Be to (from the old verb _worthen_, "to become").X.

    Then through the dell his horn resounds,
    From vain pursuit to call the hounds.John travelled to the kitchen.Back limp'd, with slow and crippled pace,
    The sulky leaders of the chase;
    Close to their master's side they press'd,
    With drooping tail and humbled crest;
    But still the dingle's hollow throat
    Prolong'd the swelling bugle note.The owlets started from their dream,
    The eagles answer'd with their scream,
    Round and around the sounds were cast
    Till echo seem'd an answering blast;
    And on the Hunter hied his way,[30]
    To join some comrades of the day;
    Yet often paused, so strange the road,
    And wondrous were the scenes it show'd.[30] "Hied his way," i.e., hastened.The western waves of ebbing day
    Roll'd o'er the glen their level way;[31]
    Each purple peak, each flinty spire,
    Was bathed in floods of living fire.But not a setting beam could glow
    Within the dark ravines below,
    Where twined the path in shadow hid,
    Round many a rocky pyramid,
    Shooting abruptly from the dell
    Its thunder-splinter'd pinnacle;
    Round many an insulated[32] mass,
    The native bulwarks of the pass,
    Huge as the tower[33] which builders vain
    Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain.The rocky summits, split and rent,
    Form'd turret, dome, or battlement,
    Or seem'd fantastically set
    With cupola or minaret,
    Wild crests as pagod[34] ever deck'd,
    Or mosque of Eastern architect.Nor were these earth-born castles bare,
    Nor lack'd they many a banner fair;
    For, from their shiver'd brows display'd,
    Far o'er the unfathomable glade,
    All twinkling with the dewdrop sheen,[35]
    The brier-rose fell in streamers green,
    And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes,
    Waved in the west wind's summer sighs.[31] "The western waves," etc., i.e., the horizontal rays of the
setting sun.[33] The Tower of Babel (see Gen.[34] The many-storied tower-like temples of the Chinese and Hindoos are
called "pagodas."About each story there is a balcony decorated with
pendants or numerous projecting points or crests.Boon[36] nature scatter'd, free and wild,
    Each plant or flower, the mountain's child.Here eglantine embalm'd the air,
    Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;
    The primrose pale and violet flower,
    Found in each cleft a narrow bower;
    Foxglove and nightshade, side by side,
    Emblems of punishment and pride,
    Group'd their dark hues with every stain
    The weather-beaten crags retain.With boughs that quaked at every breath,
    Gray birch and aspen[37] wept beneath;
    Aloft, the ash and warrior oak
    Cast anchor in the rifted rock;
    And, higher yet, the pine tree hung
    His shatter'd trunk, and frequent flung,
    Where seem'd the cliffs to meet on high,
    His boughs athwart the narrow'd sky.Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,
    Where glist'ning streamers waved and danced,
    The wanderer's eye could barely view
    The summer heaven's delicious blue;
    So wondrous wild, the whole might seem
    The scenery of a fairy dream.[37] The trembling poplar, so called from the trembling of its leaves,
which move with the slightest impulse of the air.Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep
    A narrow inlet, still and deep,
    Affording scarce such breadth of brim
    As served the wild duck's brood to swim.Lost for a space, through thickets veering,
    But broader when again appearing,
    Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face
    Could on the dark-blue mirror trace;
    And farther as the Hunter stray'd,
    Still broader sweep its channel made.The shaggy mounds no longer stood,
    Emerging from the tangled wood,
    But, wave-encircled, seem'd to float,
    Like castle girdled with its moat;
    Yet broader floods extending still
    Divide them from their parent hill,
    Till each, retiring, claims to be
    An islet in an inland sea.And now, to issue from the glen,
    No pathway meets the wanderer's ken,
    Unless he climb, with footing nice,[38]
    A far projecting precipice.The broom's[39] tough roots his ladder made,
    The hazel saplings lent their aid;
    And thus an airy point he won,
    Where, gleaming with the setting sun,
    One burnish'd sheet of living gold,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath him roll'd,
    In all her length far winding lay,
    With promontory, creek, and bay,
    And islands that, empurpled bright,[40]
    Floated amid the livelier light,
    And mountains, that like giants stand,
    To sentinel enchanted land.High on the south, huge Benvenue
    Down on the lake in masses threw
    Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurl'd,
    The fragments of an earlier world;
    A wildering forest feather'd o'er
    His ruin'd sides and summit hoar,
    While on the north, through middle air,
    Ben-an[41] heaved high his forehead bare.[39] A bushy shrub common in western Europe.[41] "Little Mountain," east of Loch Katrine.From the steep promontory gazed
    The stranger, raptured and amazed,
    And, "What a scene were here," he cried,
    "For princely pomp, or churchman's pride!On this bold brow, a lordly tower;
    In that soft vale, a lady's bower;
    On yonder meadow, far away,
    The turrets of a cloister gray;
    How blithely might the bugle horn
    Chide, on the lake, the lingering morn!How sweet, at eve, the lover's lute
    Chime, when the groves were still and mute!And, when the midnight moon should lave
    Her forehead in the silver wave,
    How solemn on the ear would come
    The holy matins'[42] distant hum,
    While the deep peal's commanding tone
    Should wake, in yonder islet lone,
    A sainted hermit from his cell,
    To drop a bead[43] with every knell--
    And bugle, lute, and bell, and all,
    Should each bewilder'd stranger call
    To friendly feast, and lighted hall.[42] The first canonical hour of the day in the Catholic Church,
beginning properly at midnight.Here referring to the striking of the
hour by the "cloister" bell.[43] "Drop a bead," i.e., say a prayer.The rosary used by Catholics is
a string of beads by which count may be kept of the prayers recited."Blithe were it then to wander here!But now,--beshrew yon nimble deer,--
    Like that same hermit's, thin and spare,
    The copse must give my evening fare;
    Some mossy bank my couch must be,
    Some rustling oak my canopy.Yet pass we that; the war and chase
    Give little choice of resting place;--
    A summer night, in greenwood spent,
    Were but to-morrow's merriment:
    But hosts may in these wilds abound,
    Such as are better miss'd than found;
    To meet with Highland plunderers here
    Were worse than loss of steed or deer.--
    I am alone;--my bugle strain
    May call some straggler of the train;
    Or, fall[44] the worst that may betide,
    Ere now this falchion has been tried."But scarce again his horn he wound,
    When lo!forth starting at the sound,
    From underneath an aged oak,
    That slanted from the islet rock,
    A damsel guider of its way,
    A little skiff shot to the bay,
    That round the promontory steep
    Led its deep line in graceful sweep,
    Eddying, in almost viewless wave,
    The weeping willow twig to lave,
    And kiss, with whispering sound and slow,
    The beach of pebbles bright as snow.The boat had touch'd this silver strand,
    Just as the Hunter left his stand,
    And stood conceal'd amid the brake,
    To view this Lady of the Lake.The maiden paused, as if again
    She thought to catch the distant strain.With head upraised, and look intent,
    And eye and ear attentive bent,
    And locks flung back, and lips apart,
    Like monument of Grecian art,
    In listening mood, she seem'd to stand,
    The guardian Naiad[45] of the strand.[45] (_N[=a]'y[)a]d._) In classic mythology, one of the lower female deities
who presided over lakes, streams, and fountains, as the Nymphs presided
over mountains, forests, and meadows.And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
    A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace,[46]
    Of finer form, or lovelier face!What though the sun, with ardent frown,
    Had slightly tinged her cheek with brown,--
    The sportive toil, which, short and light,
    Had dyed her glowing hue so bright,
    Served too in hastier swell to show
    Short glimpses of a breast of snow:
    What though no rule of courtly grace
    To measured mood had train'd her pace,--
    A foot more light, a step more true,
    Ne'er from the heath flower dash'd the dew,
    E'en the slight harebell raised its head,
    Elastic from her airy tread:
    What though upon her speech there hung
    The accents of the mountain tongue,--
    Those silver sounds, so soft, so dear,
    The list'ner held his breath to hear![46] The Graces were in classic mythology three lovely sisters who
attended Apollo and Venus.A chieftain's daughter seem'd the maid;
    Her satin snood,[47] her silken plaid,[48]
    Her golden brooch such birth betray'd.And seldom was a snood amid
    Such wild luxuriant ringlets hid,
    Whose glossy black to shame might bring
    The plumage of the raven's wing;
    And seldom o'er a breast so fair
    Mantled a plaid with modest care,
    And never brooch the folds combined
    Above a heart more good and kind.Her kindness and her worth to spy,
    You need but gaze on Ellen's eye;
    Not Katrine, in her mirror blue,
    Gives back the shaggy banks more true,
    Than every freeborn glance confess'd
    The guileless movements of her breast;
    Whether joy danced in her dark eye,
    Or woe or pity claim'd a sigh,
    Or filial love was glowing there,
    Or meek devotion pour'd a prayer,
    Or tale of injury call'd forth
    The indignant spirit of the North.One only passion unreveal'd,
    With maiden pride the maid conceal'd,
    Yet not less purely felt the flame;--
    Oh![47] A band used by Scottish maidens to bind the hair.[48] (_Pl[=a]yed._) Several yards' length of usually checkered woolen
cloth called "tartan," which the Scottish Highlanders of both sexes
wound about their bodies, and which formed a characteristic feature of
their national costume.Impatient of the silent horn,
    Now on the gale her voice was borne:--
    "Father!"she cried; the rocks around
    Loved to prolong the gentle sound.A while she paused, no answer came,--
    "Malcolm, was thine the blast?"the name
    Less resolutely utter'd fell,
    The echoes could not catch the swell."A stranger I," the Huntsman said,
    Advancing from the hazel shade.The maid, alarm'd, with hasty oar,
    Push'd her light shallop[49] from the shore,
    And when a space was gain'd between,
    Closer she drew her bosom's screen;
    (So forth the startled swan would swing,
    So turn to prune[50] his ruffled wing.)Then safe, though flutter'd and amazed,
    She paused, and on the stranger gazed.Not his the form, nor his the eye,
    That youthful maidens wont to fly.On his bold visage middle age
    Had slightly press'd its signet sage,[51]
    Yet had not quench'd the open truth
    And fiery vehemence of youth;
    Forward and frolic glee was there,
    The will to do, the soul to dare,
    The sparkling glance, soon blown to fire,
    Of hasty love, or headlong ire.His limbs were cast in manly mold,
    For hardy sports or contest bold;
    And though in peaceful garb array'd,
    And weaponless, except his blade,
    His stately mien as well implied
    A high-born heart, a martial pride,
    As if a baron's crest he wore,
    And sheathed in armor trode the shore.Slighting the petty need[52] he show'd,
    He told of his benighted road;
    His ready speech flow'd fair and free,
    In phrase of gentlest courtesy;
    Yet seem'd that tone, and gesture bland,
    Less used to sue than to command.A while the maid the stranger eyed,
    And, reassured, at length replied,
    That Highland halls were open still
    To wilder'd[53] wanderers of the hill."Nor think you unexpected come
    To yon lone isle, our desert home;
    Before the heath had lost the dew,
    This morn, a couch[54] was pull'd for you;
    On yonder mountain's purple head
    Have ptarmigan[55] and heath cock bled,
    And our broad nets have swept the mere,[56]
    To furnish forth your evening cheer."--
    "Now, by the rood,[57] my lovely maid,
    Your courtesy has err'd," he said;
    "No right have I to claim, misplaced,
    The welcome of expected guest.A wanderer, here by fortune tost,
    My way, my friends, my courser lost,
    I ne'er before, believe me, fair,
    Have ever drawn your mountain air,
    Till on this lake's romantic strand
    I found a fay in fairyland!"[54] Heather, of which the Highlanders' rude couches were made.[55] (_Taer'm[)i]-gan._) The white grouse.[57] Crucifix or cross of Christ."I well believe," the maid replied,
    As her light skiff approach'd the side,--
    "I well believe, that ne'er before
    Your foot has trod Loch Katrine's shore;
    But yet, as far as yesternight,
    Old Allan-Bane foretold your plight,--
    A gray-hair'd sire, whose eye intent
    Was on the vision'd future[58] bent.He saw your steed, a dappled gray,
    Lie dead beneath the birchen way;
    Painted exact your form and mien,
    Your hunting suit of Lincoln green,[59]
    That tassel'd horn so gayly gilt,
    That falchion's crooked blade and hilt,
    That cap with heron plumage trim,
    And yon two hounds so dark and grim.He bade that all should ready be
    To grace a guest of fair degree;[60]
    But light I held his prophecy,
    And deem'd it was my father's horn
    Whose echoes o'er the lake were borne."[58] "Vision'd future," i.e., visions of the future.[59] Lincoln green is a kind of cloth made in Lincoln.[60] "Fair degree," i.e., high rank.The stranger smiled:--"Since to your home
    A destined errant[61] knight I come,
    Announced by prophet sooth[62] and old,
    Doom'd, doubtless, for achievement bold,
    I'll lightly front each high emprise[63]
    For one kind glance of those bright eyes.Permit me, first, the task to guide
    Your fairy frigate o'er the tide."The maid, with smile suppress'd and sly,
    The toil unwonted saw him try;
    For seldom sure, if e'er before,
    His noble hand had grasp'd an oar:
    Yet with main strength his strokes he drew,
    And o'er the lake the shallop flew;
    With heads erect, and whimpering cry,
    The hounds behind their passage ply.Nor frequent does the bright oar break
    The dark'ning mirror of the lake,
    Until the rocky isle they reach,
    And moor their shallop on the beach.[63] "High emprise," i.e., dangerous adventures.The stranger view'd the shore around;
    'Twas all so close with copsewood bound,
    Nor track nor pathway might declare
    That human foot frequented there,
    Until the mountain maiden show'd
    A clambering unsuspected road
    That winded through the tangled screen,
    And open'd on a narrow green,
    Where weeping birch and willow round
    With their long fibers swept the ground.Here, for retreat in dangerous hour,
    Some chief had framed a rustic bower.It was a lodge of ample size,
    But strange of structure and device;
    Of such materials, as around
    The workman's hand had readiest found;
    Lopp'd off their boughs, their hoar trunks bared,
    And by the hatchet rudely squared.To give the walls their destined height,
    The sturdy oak and ash unite;
    While moss and clay and leaves combined
    To fence each crevice from the wind.The lighter pine trees, overhead,
    Their slender length for rafters spread,
    And wither'd heath and rushes dry
    Supplied a russet canopy.Due westward, fronting to the green,
    A rural portico was seen,
    Aloft on native pillars borne,
    Of mountain fir, with bark unshorn,
    Where Ellen's hand had taught to twine
    The ivy and Idaean vine,[64]
    The clematis, the favor'd flower
    Which boasts the name of virgin bower,
    And every hardy plant could[65] bear
    Loch Katrine's keen and searching air.An instant in this porch she staid,
    And gayly to the stranger said,
    "On Heaven and on thy Lady call,
    And enter the enchanted hall!"[64] "Idaean vine," i.e., a translation of the Latin name of the red
whortleberry, _Vitis Idaea_; but this is a shrub, and could not be
"taught to twine.""My hope, my heaven, my trust must be,
    My gentle guide, in following thee."He cross'd the threshold--and a clang
    Of angry steel that instant rang.To his bold brow his spirit rush'd,
    But soon for vain alarm he blush'd,
    When on the floor he saw display'd,
    Cause of the din, a naked blade
    Dropp'd from the sheath, that careless flung,
    Upon a stag's huge antlers swung;
    For all around, the walls to grace,
    Hung trophies of the fight or chase:
    A target[66] there, a bugle here,
    A battle-ax, a hunting spear,
    And broadswords, bows, and arrows store,
    With the tusk'd trophies of the boar.Here grins the wolf as when he died,
    And there the wild cat's brindled hide
    The frontlet of the elk adorns,
    Or mantles o'er the bison's horns;
    Pennons and flags defaced and stain'd,
    That blackening streaks of blood retain'd,
    And deerskins, dappled, dun, and white,
    With otter's fur and seal's unite,
    In rude and uncouth tapestry[67] all,
    To garnish forth the silvan hall.[67] Hangings used to decorate the walls of a room.The wondering stranger round him gazed,
    And next the fallen weapon raised:--
    Few were the arms whose sinewy strength
    Sufficed to stretch it forth at length:
    And as the brand he poised and sway'd,
    "I never knew but one," he said,
    "Whose stalwart arm might brook[68] to wield
    A blade like this in battlefield."She sighed, then smiled and took the word:
    "You see the guardian champion's sword;
    As light it trembles in his hand,
    As in my grasp a hazel wand;
    My sire's tall form might grace the part
    Of Ferragus, or Ascabart;[69]
    But in the absent giant's hold
    Are women now, and menials old."[69] Ferragus and Ascabart were two giants of romantic fable.The
former appears in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso; the latter in the History
of Bevis of Hampton.His effigy may be seen guarding the gate at
Southampton.The mistress of the mansion came,
    Mature of age, a graceful dame;
    Whose easy step and stately port
    Had well become a princely court;
    To whom, though more than kindred knew,[70]
    Young Ellen gave a mother's due.Meet welcome to her guest she made,
    And every courteous rite was paid
    That hospitality could claim,
    Though all unask'd his birth and name.Such then the reverence to a guest,
    That fellest[71] foe might join the feast,
    And from his deadliest foeman's door
    Unquestion'd turn, the banquet o'er.At length his rank the stranger names,
    "The Knight of Snowdoun,[72] James Fitz-James;[73]
    Lord of a barren heritage,[74]
    Which his brave sires, from age to age,
    By their good swords had held with toil;
    His sire had fall'n in such turmoil,
    And he, God wot,[75] was forced to stand
    Oft for his right with blade in hand.This morning with Lord Moray's[76] train
    He chased a stalwart stag in vain,
    Outstripp'd his comrades, miss'd the deer,
    Lost his good steed, and wander'd here."[70] Dame Margaret was Roderick Dhu's mother, but had acted as mother
to Ellen, and held a higher place in her affections than the ties of
blood would warrant.[72] An old name of Stirling Castle.[73] Fitz means "son" in Norman French.[74] "By the misfortunes of the earlier Jameses and the internal feuds
of the Scottish chiefs, the kingly power had become little more than a
name."[76] A half-brother of James V.Fain would the Knight in turn require
    The name and state of Ellen's sire.Well show'd the elder lady's mien
    That courts and cities she had seen;
    Ellen, though more her looks display'd
    The simple grace of silvan maid,
    In speech and gesture, form and face,
    Show'd she was come of gentle race.'Twere strange in ruder rank to find
    Such looks, such manners, and such mind.Each hint the Knight of Snowdoun gave,
    Dame Margaret heard with silence grave;
    Or Ellen, innocently gay,
    Turn'd all inquiry light away:--
    "Weird women we!by dale and down[77]
    We dwell, afar from tower and town.We stem the flood, we ride the blast,
    On wandering knights our spells we cast;
    While viewless minstrels touch the string,
    'Tis thus our charmed rhymes we sing."She sung, and still a harp unseen
    Fill'd up the symphony between.[77] Hilly or undulating land.thy warfare o'er,
      Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking:
    Dream of battled fields no more,
      Days of danger, nights of waking.In our isle's enchanted hall,
      Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,
    Fairy strains of music fall,
      Every sense in slumber dewing.[78]
    Soldier, rest!thy warfare o'er,
    Dream of fighting fields no more:
    Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
    Morn of toil, nor night of waking."No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
      Armor's clang, or war steed champing,
    Trump nor pibroch[79] summon here
      Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.Yet the lark's shrill fife may come
      At the daybreak from the fallow,[80]
    And the bittern[81] sound his drum,
      Booming from the sedgy shallow.Ruder sounds shall none be near,
    Guards nor warders challenge here,
    Here's no war steed's neigh and champing,
    Shouting clans, or squadrons stamping."[79] The Highlanders' battle air, played upon the bagpipes.[81] A kind of heron said to utter a loud and peculiar booming note.She paused--then, blushing, led the lay
    To grace the stranger of the day.Her mellow notes awhile prolong
    The cadence of the flowing song,
    Till to her lips in measured frame
    The minstrel verse spontaneous came.thy chase is done;
      While our slumbrous spells assail ye,
    Dream not, with the rising sun,
      Bugles here shall sound reveille.the deer is in his den;
      Sleep!thy hounds are by thee lying;
    Sleep!nor dream in yonder glen,
      How thy gallant steed lay dying.thy chase is done,
    Think not of the rising sun,
    For at dawning to assail ye,
    Here no bugles sound reveille."[82] (_R[=e]-v[=a]l'y[)e]._) The morning call to soldiers to arise.The hall was clear'd--the stranger's bed
    Was there of mountain heather spread,
    Where oft a hundred guests had lain,
    And dream'd their forest sports again.But vainly did the heath flower shed
    Its moorland fragrance round his head;
    Not Ellen's spell had lull'd to rest
    The fever of his troubled breast.In broken dreams the image rose
    Of varied perils, pains, and woes:
    His steed now flounders in the brake,
    Now sinks his barge upon the lake;
    Now leader of a broken host,
    His standard falls, his honor's lost.Then,--from my couch may heavenly might
    Chase that worse phantom of the night!--
    Again return'd the scenes of youth,
    Of confident undoubting truth;
    Again his soul he interchanged
    With friends whose hearts were long estranged.They come, in dim procession led,
    The cold, the faithless, and the dead;
    As warm each hand, each brow as gay,
    As if they parted yesterday.And doubt distracts him at the view--
    Oh, were his senses false or true?Dream'd he of death, or broken vow,
    Or is it all a vision now?At length, with Ellen in a grove
    He seem'd to walk, and speak of love;
    She listen'd with a blush and sigh,
    His suit was warm, his hopes were high.He sought her yielded hand to clasp,
    And a cold gauntlet[83] met his grasp:
    The phantom's sex was changed and gone,
    Upon its head a helmet shone;
    Slowly enlarged to giant size,
    With darken'd cheek and threatening eyes,
    The grisly visage, stern and hoar,
    To Ellen still a likeness bore.--
    He woke, and, panting with affright,
    Recall'd the vision of the night.The hearth's decaying brands were red,
    And deep and dusky luster shed,
    Half showing, half concealing, all
    The uncouth trophies of the hall.'Mid those the stranger fix'd his eye
    Where that huge falchion hung on high,
    And thoughts on thoughts, a countless throng,
    Rush'd, chasing countless thoughts along,
    Until, the giddy whirl to cure,
    He rose, and sought the moonshine pure.[83] A mailed glove used by warriors in the middle ages to protect
their hands from wounds.The wild rose, eglantine, and broom
    Wasted around their rich perfume:
    The birch trees wept in fragrant balm,
    The aspens slept beneath the calm;
    The silver light, with quivering glance,
    Play'd on the water's still expanse,--
    Wild were the heart whose passion's sway
    Could rage beneath the sober ray!He felt its calm, that warrior guest,
    While thus he communed with his breast:--
    "Why is it at each turn I trace
    Some memory of that exiled race?Can I not mountain maiden spy,
    But she must bear the Douglas eye?Can I not view a Highland brand,
    But it must match the Douglas hand?Can I not frame a fever'd dream,
    But still the Douglas is the theme?I'll dream no more--by manly mind
    Not even in sleep is will resign'd.My midnight orisons said o'er,
    I'll turn to rest, and dream no more."His midnight orisons he told,[84]
    A prayer with every bead of gold,
    Consign'd to Heaven his cares and woes,
    And sunk in undisturb'd repose;
    Until the heath cock shrilly crew,
    And morning dawn'd on Benvenue.I.

    At morn the blackcock trims his jetty wing,
      'Tis morning prompts the linnet's[85] blithest lay,
    All Nature's children feel the matin[86] spring
      Of life reviving, with reviving day;
    And while yon little bark glides down the bay,
      Wafting the stranger on his way again,
    Morn's genial influence roused a minstrel gray,
      And sweetly o'er the lake was heard thy strain,
    Mix'd with the sounding harp, O white-hair'd Allan-Bane![87]

[85] A small European song bird.[86] (_M[)a]t'in._) Pertaining to the morning.[87] Highland chieftains often retained in their service a bard
or minstrel, who was well versed not only in the genealogy and
achievements of the particular clan or family to which he was attached,
but in the more general history of Scotland as well."Not faster yonder rowers' might
      Flings from their oars the spray,
    Not faster yonder rippling bright,
    That tracks the shallop's course in light,
      Melts in the lake away,
    Than men from memory erase
    The benefits of former days;
    Then, stranger, go!good speed the while,
    Nor think again of the lonely isle."High place to thee in royal court,
      High place in battled[88] line,
    Good hawk and hound for silvan sport,
    Where beauty sees the brave resort,
      The honor'd meed[89] be thine!True be thy sword, thy friend sincere,
    Thy lady constant, kind, and dear,
    And lost in love's and friendship's smile
    Be memory of the lonely isle.[88] Ranged in order of battle."But if beneath yon southern sky
      A plaided stranger roam,
    Whose drooping crest and stifled sigh,
    And sunken cheek and heavy eye,
      Pine for his Highland home;
    Then, warrior, then be thine to show
    The care that soothes a wanderer's woe;
    Remember then thy hap erewhile,
    A stranger in the lonely isle."Or if on life's uncertain main
      Mishap shall mar thy sail;
    If faithful, wise, and brave in vain,
    Woe, want, and exile thou sustain
      Beneath the fickle gale;
    Waste not a sigh on fortune changed,
    On thankless courts, or friends estranged,
    But come where kindred worth shall smile,
    To greet thee in the lonely isle."As died the sounds upon the tide,
    The shallop reach'd the mainland side,
    And ere his onward way he took,
    The stranger cast a lingering look,
    Where easily his eye might reach
    The Harper on the islet beach,
    Reclined against a blighted tree,
    As wasted, gray, and worn as he.To minstrel meditation given,
    His reverend brow was raised to heaven,
    As from the rising sun to claim
    A sparkle of inspiring flame.His hand, reclined upon the wire,
    Seem'd watching the awakening fire;
    So still he sate, as those who wait
    Till judgment speak the doom of fate;
    So still, as if no breeze might dare
    To lift one lock of hoary hair;
    So still, as life itself were fled,
    In the last sound his harp had sped.V.

    Upon a rock with lichens wild,
    Beside him Ellen sate and smiled.--
    Smiled she to see the stately drake
    Lead forth his fleet[90] upon the lake,
    While her vex'd spaniel, from the beach,
    Bay'd at the prize beyond his reach?Yet tell me, then, the maid who knows,
    Why deepen'd on her cheek the rose?--
    Forgive, forgive, Fidelity!Perchance the maiden smiled to see
    Yon parting lingerer wave adieu,
    And stop and turn to wave anew;
    And, lovely ladies, ere your ire
    Condemn the heroine of my lyre,
    Show me the fair would scorn to spy,
    And prize such conquest of her eye!While yet he loiter'd on the spot,
    It seem'd as Ellen mark'd him not;
    But when he turn'd him to the glade,
    One courteous parting sign she made;
    And after, oft the Knight would say,
    That not, when prize of festal day
    Was dealt him by the brightest fair
    Who e'er wore jewel in her hair,
    So highly did his bosom swell,
    As at that simple mute farewell.Now with a trusty mountain guide,
    And his dark staghounds by his side,
    He parts--the maid, unconscious still,
    Watch'd him wind slowly round the hill;
    But when his stately form was hid,
    The guardian in her bosom chid--
    "Thy Malcolm!'Twas thus upbraiding conscience said,--
    "Not so had Malcolm idly hung
    On the smooth phrase of southern tongue;
    Not so had Malcolm strain'd his eye,
    Another step than thine to spy.--
    Wake, Allan-Bane," aloud she cried,
    To the old Minstrel by her side,--
    "Arouse thee from thy moody dream!I'll give thy harp heroic theme,
    And warm thee with a noble name;
    Pour forth the glory of the Graeme!"[91]
    Scarce from her lip the word had rush'd,
    When deep the conscious maiden blush'd;
    For of his clan, in hall and bower,
    Young Malcolm Graeme was held the flower.[91] The ancient and powerful family of Graham of Dumbarton and
Stirling supplied some of the most remarkable characters in Scottish
annals.The Minstrel waked his harp--three times
    Arose the well-known martial chimes,
    And thrice their high heroic pride
    In melancholy murmurs died."Vainly thou bidst, O noble maid,"
    Clasping his wither'd hands, he said,
    "Vainly thou bidst me wake the strain,
    Though all unwont to bid in vain.than mine a mightier hand
    Has tuned my harp, my strings has spann'd!I touch the chords of joy, but low
    And mournful answer notes of woe;
    And the proud march, which victors tread,
    Sinks in the wailing for the dead.Oh, well for me, if mine alone
    That dirge's deep prophetic tone!If, as my tuneful fathers said,
    This harp, which erst[92] St.Modan[93] sway'd,
    Can thus its master's fate foretell,
    Then welcome be the Minstrel's knell!"[93] A Scotch abbot of the seventh century.dear lady, thus it sigh'd
    The eve thy sainted mother died;
    And such the sounds which, while I strove
    To wake a lay of war or love,
    Came marring all the festal mirth,
    Appalling me who gave them birth,
    And, disobedient to my call,
    Wail'd loud through Bothwell's[94] banner'd hall,
    Ere Douglases, to ruin driven,
    Were exiled from their native heaven.--
    Oh!if yet worse mishap and woe
    My master's house must undergo,
    Or aught but weal to Ellen fair
    Brood in these accents of despair,
    No future bard, sad Harp!shall fling
    Triumph or rapture from thy string;
    One short, one final strain shall flow,
    Fraught with unutterable woe,
    Then shiver'd shall thy fragments lie,
    Thy master cast him down and die!"[94] Bothwell Castle on the Clyde, nine miles from Glasgow, was the
principal seat of the Earls of Angus, the elder branch of the Douglas
family, until 1528, when James V. escaped from his virtual imprisonment
by Angus acting as regent, and drove the Douglases into exile,
confiscating their estates (See Introduction).Soothing she answer'd him--"Assuage,
    Mine honor'd friend, the fears of age;
    All melodies to thee are known,
    That harp has rung or pipe[95] has blown,
    In Lowland vale or Highland glen,
    From Tweed to Spey[96]--what marvel, then,
    At times, unbidden notes should rise,
    Confusedly bound in memory's ties,
    Entangling, as they rush along,
    The war march with the funeral song?--
    Small ground is now for boding fear;
    Obscure, but safe, we rest us here.My sire, in native virtue great,
    Resigning lordship, lands, and state,
    Not then to fortune more resign'd,
    Than yonder oak might give the wind;
    The graceful foliage storms may reave,[97]
    The noble stem they cannot grieve.For me,"--she stoop'd, and, looking round,
    Pluck'd a blue harebell from the ground,--
    "For me, whose memory scarce conveys
    An image of more splendid days,
    This little flower, that loves the lea,
    May well my simple emblem be;
    It drinks heaven's dew as blithe as rose
    That in the King's own garden grows;
    And when I place it in my hair,
    Allan, a bard is bound to swear
    He ne'er saw coronet so fair."Then playfully the chaplet wild
    She wreath'd in her dark locks, and smiled.[96] The river Tweed is on the southern boundary of Scotland.The Spey
is a river of the extreme north.X.

    Her smile, her speech, with winning sway,
    Wiled[98] the old Harper's mood away.With such a look as hermits throw,
    When angels stoop to soothe their woe,
    He gazed, till fond regret and pride
    Thrill'd to a tear, then thus replied:
    "Loveliest and best!thou little know'st
    The rank, the honors, thou hast lost!Oh, might I live to see thee grace,
    In Scotland's court, thy birthright place,
    To see my favorite's step advance,
    The lightest in the courtly dance,
    The cause of every gallant's sigh,
    And leading star of every eye,
    And theme of every minstrel's art,
    The Lady of the Bleeding Heart!"[99]

[98] Beguiled.[99] The Bleeding Heart was the cognizance of the Douglas family in
memory of the heart of Bruce, which that monarch on his deathbed
bequeathed to James Douglas, that he might carry it upon a crusade to
the Holy City."Fair dreams are these," the maiden cried,
    (Light was her accent, yet she sigh'd;)
    "Yet is this mossy rock to me
    Worth splendid chair and canopy;
    Nor would my footsteps spring more gay
    In courtly dance than blithe strathspey,[100]
    Nor half so pleased mine ear incline
    To royal minstrel's lay as thine.And then for suitors proud and high,
    To bend before my conquering eye,--
    Thou, flattering bard!thyself wilt say,
    That grim Sir Roderick owns its sway.The Saxon[101] scourge, Clan-Alpine's[102] pride,
    The terror of Loch Lomond's side,
    Would, at my suit, thou know'st, delay
    A Lennox[103] foray--for a day."[100] A rustic Highland dance which takes its name from the strath or
broad valley of the Spey.[101] "The Scottish Highlander calls himself Gael, and terms the
Lowlanders Sassenach or Saxons."[102] Gregor, the progenitor of the clan MacGregor, was supposed to be
the son of a Scotch King Alpine: hence the MacGregors are sometimes
called MacAlpines.[103] The district lying south of Loch Lomond.The ancient bard his glee repress'd:
    "I'll hast thou chosen theme for jest!For who, through all this western wild,
    Named Black[104] Sir Roderick e'er, and smiled?In Holy-Rood[105] a knight he slew;
    I saw, when back the dirk he drew,
    Courtiers give place before the stride
    Of the undaunted homicide;
    And since, though outlaw'd,[106] hath his hand
    Full sternly kept his mountain land.woe the day
    That I such hated truth should say--
    The Douglas, like a stricken deer,
    Disown'd by every noble peer,
    Even the rude refuge we have here?this wild marauding Chief
    Alone might hazard our relief,
    And, now thy maiden charms expand,
    Looks for his guerdon[107] in thy hand;
    Full soon may dispensation[108] sought,
    To back his suit, from Rome be brought.Then, though an exile on the hill,
    Thy father, as the Douglas, still
    Be held in reverence and fear;
    And though to Roderick thou'rt so dear,
    That thou mightst guide with silken thread,
    Slave of thy will, this Chieftain dread,
    Yet, O loved maid, thy mirth refrain!Thy hand is on a lion's mane."[105] "In Holy-Rood," i.e., in the very presence of royalty.Holyrood
was the King's palace in Edinburgh.[106] A person who had been outlawed, or declared without the
protection of the law, could not bring an action at law.Any one could
steal his property, or even kill him, without fear of legal punishment.[108] Roderick and Ellen, being cousins, could not marry without
dispensation, or special license from the Pope."Minstrel," the maid replied, and high
    Her father's soul glanced from her eye,
    "My debts to Roderick's house I know:
    All that a mother could bestow,
    To Lady Margaret's care I owe,
    Since first an orphan in the wild
    She sorrow'd o'er her sister's child;
    To her brave chieftain son, from ire
    Of Scotland's King who shrouds[109] my sire,
    A deeper, holier debt is owed;
    And, could I pay it with my blood,
    Allan!Sir Roderick should command
    My blood, my life,--but not my hand.Rather will Ellen Douglas dwell
    A votaress in Maronnan's[110] cell;
    Rather through realms beyond the sea,
    Seeking the world's cold charity,
    Where ne'er was spoke a Scottish word,
    And ne'er the name of Douglas heard,
    An outcast pilgrim will she rove,
    Than wed the man she cannot love."[110] Kilmaronock, a village about two miles southeast of Loch Lomond,
has a chapel or convent dedicated to St.Maronnan, of whom little is
remembered."Thou shakest, good friend, thy tresses gray,--
    That pleading look, what can it say
    But what I own?--I grant him[111] brave,
    But wild as Bracklinn's[112] thundering wave;
    And generous--save[113] vindictive mood,
    Or jealous transport, chafe his blood:
    I grant him true to friendly band,
    As his claymore is to his hand;
    But oh!that very blade of steel
    More mercy for a foe would feel:
    I grant him liberal, to fling
    Among his clan the wealth they bring,
    When back by lake and glen they wind,
    And in the Lowland leave behind,
    Where once some pleasant hamlet stood,
    A mass of ashes slaked[114] with blood.The hand that for my father fought
    I honor, as his daughter ought;
    But can I clasp it reeking red,
    From peasants slaughter'd in their shed?wildly while his virtues gleam,
    They make his passions darker seem,
    And flash along his spirit high,
    Like lightning o'er the midnight sky.While yet a child,--and children know,
    Instinctive taught, the friend and foe,--
    I shudder'd at his brow of gloom,
    His shadowy plaid, and sable plume;
    A maiden grown, I ill could bear
    His haughty mien and lordly air:
    But, if thou join'st a suitor's claim,
    In serious mood, to Roderick's name,
    I thrill with anguish!or, if e'er
    A Douglas knew the word, with fear.To change such odious theme were best,--
    What thinkst thou of our stranger guest?"[111] "I grant him," i.e., I grant that he is.[112] A cascade on the Keltie.Woe the while
    That brought such wanderer to our isle!Thy father's battle brand, of yore
    For Tine-man[115] forged by fairy lore,
    What time he leagued, no longer foes,
    His Border spears with Hotspur's bows,
    Did, self-unscabbarded, foreshow
    The footstep of a secret foe.If courtly spy hath harbor'd here,
    What may we for the Douglas fear?What for this island, deem'd of old
    Clan-Alpine's last and surest hold?If neither spy nor foe, I pray
    What yet may jealous Roderick say?--Nay, wave not thy disdainful head,
    Bethink thee of the discord dread
    That kindled, when at Beltane[116] game
    Thou ledst the dance with Malcolm Graeme;
    Still, though thy sire the peace renew'd,
    Smolders in Roderick's breast the feud.Beware!--But hark, what sounds are these?My dull ears catch no faltering breeze;
    No weeping birch, nor aspens wake,
    Nor breath is dimpling in the lake;
    Still is the canna's[117] hoary beard;
    Yet, by my minstrel faith, I heard--
    And hark again!some pipe of war
    Sends the bold pibroch from afar."[115] Archibald Douglas, so called because so many of his enterprises
ended in _tine_ (or "distress").After being defeated by Harry Hotspur
at Homildon Hill in 1402, he joined Hotspur in his rebellion against
Henry IV., and in the following year was with him disastrously defeated
at Shrewsbury.[116] The Celtic festival celebrated about the 1st of May.Far up the lengthen'd lake were spied
    Four darkening specks upon the tide,
    That, slow enlarging on the view,
    Four mann'd and masted barges grew,
    And, bearing downwards from Glengyle,
    Steer'd full upon the lonely isle;
    The point of Brianchoil[118] they pass'd,
    And, to the windward as they cast,
    Against the sun they gave to shine
    The bold Sir Roderick's banner'd Pine.[119]
    Nearer and nearer as they bear,
    Spears, pikes, and axes flash in air.Now might you see the tartans brave,[120]
    And plaids and plumage dance and wave:
    Now see the bonnets[121] sink and rise,
    As his tough oar the rower plies;
    See, flashing at each sturdy stroke,
    The wave ascending into smoke;
    See the proud pipers on the bow,
    And mark the gaudy streamers[122] flow
    From their loud chanters down, and sweep
    The furrow'd bosom of the deep,
    As, rushing through the lake amain,
    They plied the ancient Highland strain.[118] A promontory on the north bank of Loch Katrine.[119] The badge or crest of the MacGregors.[122] Ribbons attached to the chanters or tubes of a bagpipe for
decoration.Ever, as on they bore, more loud
    And louder rung the pibroch proud.At first the sound, by distance tame,
    Mellow'd along the waters came,
    And, lingering long by cape and bay,
    Wail'd every harsher note away;
    Then, bursting bolder on the ear,
    The clan's shrill Gathering they could hear;
    Those thrilling sounds, that call the might
    Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight.Thick beat the rapid notes, as when
    The mustering hundreds shake the glen,
    And, hurrying at the signal dread,
    The batter'd earth returns their tread.Then prelude light, of livelier tone,
    Express'd their merry marching on,
    Ere peal of closing battle rose,
    With mingled outcry, shrieks, and blows;
    And mimic din of stroke and ward,
    As broadsword upon target jarr'd;
    And groaning pause, ere yet again,
    Condensed, the battle yell'd amain;
    The rapid charge, the rallying shout,
    Retreat borne headlong into rout,
    And bursts of triumph, to declare
    Clan-Alpine's conquests--all were there.Nor ended thus the strain; but slow,
    Sunk in a moan prolong'd and low,
    And changed the conquering clarion swell,
    For wild lament o'er those that fell.The war pipes ceased; but lake and hill
    Were busy with their echoes still;
    And, when they slept, a vocal strain
    Bade their hoarse chorus wake again,
    While loud a hundred clansmen raise
    Their voices in their Chieftain's praise.Each boatman, bending to his oar,
    With measured sweep the burden[123] bore,
    In such wild cadence as the breeze
    Makes through December's leafless trees.The chorus first could Allan know,
    "Roderick Vich Alpine, ho!And near, and nearer as they row'd,
    Distinct the martial ditty flow'd.Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!Honor'd and bless'd be the ever-green Pine!Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,
      Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!Heaven send it happy dew,
          Earth lend it sap anew,
      Gayly to bourgeon,[124] and broadly to grow,
          While every Highland glen
          Sends our shout back agen,[125]
      "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu,[126] ho!Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,
      Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;
    When the whirlwind has stripp'd every leaf on the mountain,
      The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade.Moor'd in the rifted rock,
          Proof to the tempest's shock,

      Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!Oh that some seedling gem,
          Worthy such noble stem,
      Honor'd and bless'd in their shadow might grow!Loud should Clan-Alpine then
          Ring from her deepmost glen,

    Had Lady Margaret sought the strand.Loose on the breeze their tresses flew,
    And high their snowy arms they threw,
    As echoing back with shrill acclaim,
    And chorus wild, the Chieftain's name;
    While prompt to please, with mother's art,
    The darling passion of his heart,
    The Dame call'd Ellen to the strand,
    To greet her kinsman ere he land:
    "Come, loiterer, come!a Douglas thou,
    And shun to wreathe a victor's brow?"Reluctantly and slow, the maid
    The unwelcome summoning obey'd,
    And, when a distant bugle rung,
    In the mid-path aside she sprung:--
    "List, Allan-Bane!From mainland cast,
    I hear my father's signal blast.Be ours," she cried, "the skiff to guide,
    And waft him from the mountain side."Then, like a sunbeam, swift and bright,
    She darted to her shallop light,
    And, eagerly while Roderick scann'd,
    For her dear form, his mother's band,
    The islet far behind her lay,
    And she had landed in the bay.Some feelings are to mortals given,
    With less of earth in them than heaven:
    And if there be a human tear
    From passion's dross refined and clear,
    A tear so limpid and so meek,
    It would not stain an angel's cheek,
    'Tis that which pious fathers shed
    Upon a duteous daughter's head!And as the Douglas to his breast
    His darling Ellen closely press'd,
    Such holy drops her tresses steep'd,
    Though 'twas an hero's eye that weep'd.Nor while on Ellen's faltering tongue
    Her filial welcomes crowded hung,
    Mark'd she, that fear (affection's proof)
    Still held a graceful youth aloof;
    No!not till Douglas named his name,
    Although the youth was Malcolm Graeme.Allan, with wistful look the while,
    Mark'd Roderick landing on the isle;
    His master piteously he eyed,
    Then gazed upon the Chieftain's pride,
    Then dash'd, with hasty hand, away
    From his dimm'd eye the gathering spray;
    And Douglas, as his hand he laid
    On Malcolm's shoulder, kindly said,
    "Canst thou, young friend, no meaning spy
    In my poor follower's glistening eye?I'll tell thee:--he recalls the day
    When in my praise he led the lay
    O'er the arch'd gate of Bothwell proud,
    While many a minstrel answer'd loud,
    When Percy's Norman pennon,[133] won
    In bloody field, before me shone,
    And twice ten knights, the least a name
    As mighty as yon Chief may claim,
    Gracing my pomp, behind me came.Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud
    Was I of all that marshal'd crowd,
    Though the waned crescent[134] own'd my might,
    And in my train troop'd lord and knight,
    Though Blantyre[135] hymn'd her holiest lays,
    And Bothwell's bards flung back my praise,
    As when this old man's silent tear,
    And this poor maid's affection dear,
    A welcome give more kind and true,
    Than aught my better fortunes knew.Forgive, my friend, a father's boast,
    Oh!it out-beggars[136] all I lost!"[133] The battle flag which Earl Douglas won from Hotspur at Newcastle
in 1388.[134] A crescent was one of the badges of the Percies.[135] An abbey near Bothwell Castle.Delightful praise!--Like summer rose,
    That brighter in the dewdrop glows,
    The bashful maiden's cheek appear'd,
    For Douglas spoke, and Malcolm heard.The flush of shamefaced joy to hide,
    The hounds, the hawk, her cares divide;
    The loved caresses of the maid
    The dogs with crouch and whimper paid;
    And, at her whistle, on her hand
    The falcon took his favorite stand,
    Closed his dark wing, relax'd his eye,
    Nor, though unhooded,[137] sought to fly.And, trust, while in such guise she stood,
    Like fabled goddess[138] of the wood,
    That if a father's partial thought
    O'erweigh'd her worth and beauty aught,
    Well might the lover's judgment fail
    To balance with a juster scale;
    For with each secret glance he stole,
    The fond enthusiast sent his soul.[137] Hawks or falcons were trained to pursue small game during the
middle ages.When not in flight, they were usually blinded by means of
a hood adorned with little bells.[138] Ellen, surrounded by the hounds and with the falcon on her hand,
is likened to Diana, the goddess of the chase, in Greek mythology.Of stature tall, and slender frame,
    But firmly knit, was Malcolm Graeme.The belted plaid and tartan hose
    Did ne'er more graceful limbs disclose;
    His flaxen hair, of sunny hue,
    Curl'd closely round his bonnet blue.Train'd to the chase, his eagle eye
    The ptarmigan in snow could spy:
    Each pass, by mountain, lake, and heath,
    He knew, through Lennox and Menteith;
    Vain was the bound of dark-brown doe
    When Malcolm bent his sounding bow;
    And scarce that doe, though wing'd with fear,
    Outstripp'd in speed the mountaineer:
    Right up Ben-Lomond could he press,
    And not a sob his toil confess.His form accorded with a mind
    Lively and ardent, frank and kind;
    A blither heart, till Ellen came,
    Did never love nor sorrow tame;
    It danced as lightsome in his breast,
    As play'd the feather on his crest.Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth,
    His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth,
    And bards, who saw his features bold,
    When kindled by the tales of old,
    Said, were that youth to manhood grown,
    Not long should Roderick Dhu's renown
    Be foremost voiced by mountain fame,
    But quail to that of Malcolm Graeme.Now back they wend their watery way,
    And, "O my sire!"did Ellen say,
    "Why urge thy chase so far astray?And why"--
    The rest was in her speaking eye."My child, the chase I follow far,
    'Tis mimicry of noble war;
    And with that gallant pastime reft
    Were all of Douglas I have left.I met young Malcolm as I stray'd
    Far eastward, in Glenfinlas' shade.Nor stray'd I safe; for, all around,
    Hunters and horsemen scour'd the ground.This youth, though still a royal ward,[139]
    Risk'd life and land to be my guard,
    And through the passes of the wood
    Guided my steps, not unpursued;
    And Roderick shall his welcome make,
    Despite old spleen,[140] for Douglas' sake.Then must he seek Strath-Endrick glen,
    Nor peril aught for me agen."[139] "Royal ward," i.e., under the guardianship of the King, Douglas's
chief enemy.Sir Roderick, who to meet them came,
    Redden'd at sight of Malcolm Graeme,
    Yet not in action, word, or eye,
    Fail'd aught in hospitality.In talk and sport they whiled away
    The morning of that summer day;
    But at high noon a courier light
    Held secret parley with the Knight,
    Whose moody aspect soon declared
    That evil were the news he heard.Deep thought seem'd toiling in his head;
    Yet was the evening banquet made,
    Ere he assembled round the flame,
    His mother, Douglas, and the Graeme,
    And Ellen too; then cast around
    His eyes, then fix'd them on the ground,
    As studying phrase that might avail
    Best to convey unpleasant tale.Long with his dagger's hilt he play'd,
    Then raised his haughty brow, and said:--


XXVIII."Short be my speech;--nor time affords,
    Nor my plain temper, glozing[141] words.Kinsman and father,--if such name
    Douglas vouchsafe to Roderick's claim;
    Mine honor'd mother;--Ellen--why,
    My cousin, turn away thine eye?--
    And Graeme; in whom I hope to know--
    Full soon a noble friend or foe,
    When age shall give thee thy command
    And leading in thy native land,--
    List all!--The King's vindictive pride
    Boasts to have tamed the Border-side,
    Where chiefs, with hound and hawk who came
    To share their monarch's silvan game,
    Themselves in bloody toils were snared;
    And when the banquet they prepared,
    And wide their loyal portals flung,
    O'er their own gateway struggling hung.[142]
    Loud cries their blood from Meggat's[143] mead,
    From Yarrow[144] braes,[145] and banks of Tweed,
    Where the lone streams of Ettrick[146] glide,
    And from the silver Teviot's[147] side;
    The dales, where martial clans did ride,
    Are now one sheep-walk,[148] waste and wide.This tyrant of the Scottish throne,
    So faithless and so ruthless known,
    Now hither comes; his end the same,
    The same pretext of silvan game.What grace for Highland Chiefs, judge ye
    By fate of Border chivalry.Yet more; amid Glenfinlas green,
    Douglas, thy stately form was seen--
    This by espial sure I know:
    Your counsel, in the streight I show."[149]

emergency I indicate.Ellen and Margaret fearfully
    Sought comfort in each other's eye,
    Then turn'd their ghastly look, each one,
    This to her sire, that to her son.The hasty color went and came
    In the bold cheek of Malcolm Graeme;
    But from his glance it well appear'd
    'Twas but for Ellen that he fear'd;
    While, sorrowful, but undismay'd,
    The Douglas thus his counsel said:--
    "Brave Roderick, though the tempest roar,
    It may but thunder, and pass o'er;
    Nor will I here remain an hour,
    To draw the lightning on thy bower;
    For well thou know'st, at this gray head
    The royal bolt were fiercest sped.For thee, who, at thy King's command,
    Canst aid him with a gallant band,
    Submission, homage, humbled pride,
    Shall turn the monarch's wrath aside.Poor remnants of the Bleeding Heart,[150]
    Ellen and I will seek, apart,
    The refuge of some forest cell,
    There, like the hunted quarry, dwell,
    Till on the mountain and the moor,
    The stern pursuit be pass'd and o'er.""No, by mine honor," Roderick said,
    "So help me Heaven, and my good blade!Blasted be yon Pine,
    My fathers' ancient crest and mine,
    If from its shade in danger part
    The lineage of the Bleeding Heart!Mary travelled to the bedroom.Hear my blunt speech: grant me this maid
    To wife, thy counsel to mine aid;
    To Douglas, leagued with Roderick Dhu,
    Will friends and allies flock enow;[151]
    Like cause of doubt, distrust, and grief,
    Will bind to us each Western Chief.When the loud pipes my bridal tell,
    The Links of Forth[152] shall hear the knell,
    The guards shall start in Stirling's[153] porch;
    And, when I light the nuptial torch,
    A thousand villages in flames
    Shall scare the slumbers of King James!--Nay, Ellen, blench not thus away,
    And, mother, cease these signs, I pray;
    I meant not all my heat might say.Small need of inroad, or of fight,
    When the sage Douglas may unite
    Each mountain clan in friendly band,
    To guard the passes of their land,
    Till the foil'd King, from pathless glen,
    Shall bootless turn him home agen."[152] The windings of the river Forth: hence the inhabitants of that
region.[153] Stirling Castle, on the Forth, below the junction of the Frith,
was a favorite residence of the Scottish kings.There are who have, at midnight hour,
    In slumber scaled a dizzy tower,
    And, on the verge that beetled o'er
    The ocean tide's incessant roar,
    Dream'd calmly out their dangerous dream,
    Till waken'd by the morning beam;
    When, dazzled by the eastern glow,
    Such startler[154] cast his glance below,
    And saw unmeasured depth around,
    And heard unintermitted sound,
    And thought the battled fence[155] so frail,
    It waved like cobweb in the gale;--
    Amid his senses' giddy wheel,
    Did he not desperate impulse feel,
    Headlong to plunge himself below,
    And meet the worst his fears foreshow?--
    Thus, Ellen, dizzy and astound,[156]
    As sudden ruin yawn'd around,
    By crossing[157] terrors wildly toss'd,
    Still for the Douglas fearing most,
    Could scarce the desperate thought withstand,
    To buy his safety with her hand.[155] "Battled fence," i.e., battlemented rampart.Such purpose dread could Malcolm spy
    In Ellen's quivering lip and eye,
    And eager rose to speak--but ere
    His tongue could hurry forth his fear,
    Had Douglas mark'd the hectic strife,
    Where death seem'd combating with life;
    For to her cheek, in feverish flood,
    One instant rush'd the throbbing blood,
    Then ebbing back, with sudden sway,
    Left its domain as wan as clay.he cried,
    "My daughter cannot be thy bride;
    Not that the blush to wooer dear,
    Nor paleness that of maiden fear.It may not be--forgive her, Chief,
    Nor hazard aught for our relief.Against his sovereign, Douglas ne'er
    Will level a rebellious spear.'Twas I that taught his youthful hand
    To rein a steed and wield a brand;
    I see him yet, the princely boy!Not Ellen more my pride and joy;
    I love him still, despite my wrongs,
    By hasty wrath, and slanderous tongues.Oh, seek the grace you well may find,
    Without a cause to mine combined."Mary travelled to the kitchen.Twice through the hall the Chieftain strode;
    The waving of his tartans broad,
    And darken'd brow, where wounded pride
    With ire and disappointment vied,
    Seem'd, by the torch's gloomy light,
    Like the ill Demon of the night,
    Stooping his pinions' shadowy sway
    Upon the nighted pilgrim's way:
    But, unrequited Love!thy dart
    Plunged deepest its envenom'd smart,
    And Roderick, with thine anguish stung,
    At length the hand of Douglas wrung,
    While eyes that mock'd at tears before,
    With bitter drops were running o'er.The death pangs of long-cherish'd hope
    Scarce in that ample breast had scope,
    But, struggling with his spirit proud,
    Convulsive heaved its checker'd shroud,[158]
    While every sob--so mute were all--
    Was heard distinctly through the hall.The son's despair, the mother's look,
    Ill might the gentle Ellen brook;
    She rose, and to her side there came,
    To aid her parting steps, the Graeme.[158] "Checker'd shroud," i.e., his tartan plaid.Then Roderick from the Douglas broke--
    As flashes flame through sable smoke,
    Kindling its wreaths, long, dark, and low,
    To one broad blaze of ruddy glow,
    So the deep anguish of despair
    Burst, in fierce jealousy, to air.With stalwart grasp his hand he laid
    On Malcolm's breast and belted plaid:
    "Back, beardless boy!"he sternly said,
    "Back, minion!hold'st thou thus at naught
    The lesson I so lately taught?This roof, the Douglas, and that maid,
    Thank thou for punishment delay'd."Eager as greyhound on his game,
    Fiercely with Roderick grappled Graeme."Perish my name, if aught afford
    Its Chieftain safety save his sword!"Thus as they strove, their desperate hand
    Griped to the dagger or the brand,
    And death had been--but Douglas rose,
    And thrust between the struggling foes
    His giant strength:--"Chieftains, forego!I hold the first who strikes, my foe.--
    Madmen, forbear your frantic jar!is the Douglas fall'n so far,
    His daughter's hand is deem'd the spoil
    Of such dishonorable broil!"Sullen and slowly they unclasp,
    As struck with shame, their desperate grasp,
    And each upon his rival glared,
    With foot advanced, and blade half bared.Ere yet the brands aloft were flung,
    Margaret on Roderick's mantle hung,
    And Malcolm heard his Ellen's scream,
    As falter'd through terrific dream.Then Roderick plunged in sheath his sword,
    And veil'd his wrath in scornful word:
    "Rest safe till morning; pity 'twere
    Such cheek should feel the midnight air!Then mayst thou to James Stuart tell,
    Roderick will keep the lake and fell,[159]
    Nor lackey, with his freeborn clan,
    The pageant pomp of earthly man.More would he of Clan-Alpine know,
    Thou canst our strength and passes show.--
    Malise, what ho!"--his henchman[160] came;
    "Give our safe-conduct[161] to the Graeme."Young Malcolm answer'd, calm and bold,
    "Fear nothing for thy favorite hold;
    The spot an angel deigned to grace
    Is bless'd, though robbers haunt the place.Thy churlish courtesy for those
    Reserve, who fear to be thy foes.As safe to me the mountain way
    At midnight as in blaze of day,
    Though with his boldest at his back,
    Even Roderick Dhu beset the track.--
    Brave Douglas,--lovely Ellen,--nay,
    Naught here of parting will I say.Earth does not hold a lonesome glen
    So secret, but we meet agen.--
    Chieftain!we too shall find an hour,"
    He said, and left the silvan bower.[160] An officer or secretary who attended closely on the chieftain
(from _hengst_, or "horseman," i.e., groom).Old Allan follow'd to the strand,
    (Such was the Douglas's command,)
    And anxious told, how, on the morn,
    The stern Sir Roderick deep had sworn,
    The Fiery Cross[162] should circle o'er
    Dale, glen, and valley, down, and moor.Much were the peril to the Graeme,
    From those who to the signal came;
    Far up the lake 'twere safest land,
    Himself would row him to the strand.He gave his counsel to the wind,
    While Malcolm did, unheeding, bind,
    Round dirk and pouch and broadsword roll'd,
    His ample plaid in tighten'd fold,
    And stripp'd his limbs to such array
    As best might suit the watery way,--

[162] See Note 4, p.Then spoke abrupt: "Farewell to thee,
    Pattern of old fidelity!"The Minstrel's hand he kindly press'd,--
    "Oh!My sovereign holds in ward my land,
    My uncle leads my vassal band;
    To tame his foes, his friends to aid,
    Poor Malcolm has but heart and blade.Yet, if there be one faithful Graeme
    Who loves the Chieftain of his name,
    Not long shall honor'd Douglas dwell,
    Like hunted stag, in mountain cell;
    Nor, ere yon pride-swoll'n robber dare,--
    I may not give the rest to air!Tell Roderick Dhu, I owed him naught,
    Not the poor service of a boat,
    To waft me to yon mountain side."Bold o'er the flood his head he bore,
    And stoutly steer'd him from the shore;
    And Allan strain'd his anxious eye,
    Far'mid the lake his form to spy,
    Darkening across each puny wave,
    To which the moon her silver gave.Fast as the cormorant could skim,
    The swimmer plied each active limb;
    Then landing in the moonlight dell,
    Loud shouted, of his weal to tell.The Minstrel heard the far halloo,
    And joyful from the shore withdrew.I.

    Time rolls his ceaseless course.The race of yore,
      Who danced our infancy upon their knee,
    And told our marveling boyhood legends store,
      Of their strange ventures happ'd[163] by land or sea,
    How are they blotted from the things that be!How few, all weak and wither'd of their force,
    Wait on the verge of dark eternity,
      Like stranded wrecks, the tide returning hoarse,
    To sweep them from our sight!Yet live there still who[164] can remember well,
      How, when a mountain chief his bugle blew,
    Both field and forest, dingle, cliff, and dell,
      And solitary heath, the signal knew;
    And fast the faithful clan around him drew,
      What time[165] the warning note was keenly wound,
    What time aloft their kindred banner flew,
      While clamorous war pipes yell'd the gathering sound,
    And while the Fiery Cross[166] glanced, like a meteor, round.[163] "Ventures happ'd," i.e., adventures which happened.[165] "What time," i.e., when.[166] When a chieftain wished to assemble his clan suddenly, he sent
out a swift and trusty messenger, bearing a symbol, called the Fiery
Cross, consisting of a rough wooden cross the charred ends of which
had been quenched in the blood of a goat.All members of the clan who
saw this symbol, and who were capable of bearing arms, were obliged
to appear in arms forthwith at the appointed rendezvous.Arrived at
the next hamlet, the messenger delivered the symbol and the name of
the rendezvous to the principal personage, who immediately forwarded
them by a fresh messenger.In this way the signal for gathering was
disseminated throughout the territory of a large clan in a surprisingly
short space of time.The summer dawn's reflected hue
    To purple changed Loch Katrine blue;
    Mildly and soft the western breeze
    Just kiss'd the lake, just stirr'd the trees;
    And the pleased lake, like maiden coy,
    Trembled but dimpled not for joy;
    The mountain shadows on her breast
    Were neither broken nor at rest;
    In bright uncertainty they lie,
    Like future joys to Fancy's eye.The water lily to the light
    Her chalice rear'd of silver bright;
    The doe awoke, and to the lawn,
    Begemm'd with dewdrops, led her fawn;
    The gray mist left the mountain side,
    The torrent show'd its glistening pride;
    Invisible in flecked sky,
    The lark sent down her revelry;
    The blackbird and the speckled thrush
    Good-morrow gave from brake and bush;
    In answer coo'd the cushat dove
    Her notes of peace, and rest, and love.No thought of peace, no thought of rest,
    Assuaged the storm in Roderick's breast.With sheathed broadsword in his hand,
    Abrupt he paced the islet strand,
    And eyed the rising sun, and laid
    His hand on his impatient blade.Beneath a rock, his vassals' care
    Was prompt the ritual[167] to prepare,
    With deep and deathful meaning fraught;
    For such Antiquity had taught
    Was preface meet, ere yet abroad
    The Cross of Fire should take its road.The shrinking band stood oft aghast
    At the impatient glance he cast;--
    Such glance the mountain eagle threw,
    As, from the cliffs of Benvenue,
    She spread her dark sails on the wind,
    And, high in middle heaven reclined,
    With her broad shadow on the lake,
    Silenced the warblers of the brake.[167] The ritual or religious ceremony with which the Fiery Cross was
made.A heap of wither'd boughs was piled,
    Of juniper and rowan[168] wild,
    Mingled with shivers from the oak,
    Rent by the lightning's recent stroke.Brian, the Hermit, by it stood,
    Barefooted, in his frock and hood.[169]
    His grisled beard and matted hair
    Obscured a visage of despair;
    His naked arms and legs, seamed o'er,
    The scars of frantic penance bore.That monk, of savage form and face,
    The impending danger of his race
    Had drawn[170] from deepest solitude,
    Far in Benharrow's[171] bosom rude.Not his the mien of Christian priest,
    But Druid's,[172] from the grave released,
    Whose hardened heart and eye might brook
    On human sacrifice to look;
    And much, 'twas said, of heathen lore,
    Mixed in the charms he muttered o'er.The hallow'd creed gave only worse
    And deadlier emphasis of curse;
    No peasant sought that Hermit's prayer,
    His cave the pilgrim shunn'd with care,
    The eager huntsman knew his bound,
    And in mid-chase called off his hound;
    Or if, in lonely glen or strath,
    The desert dweller met his path,
    He pray'd, and signed the cross between,
    While terror took devotion's mien.[169] "Frock and hood," i.e., the usual garments of monks or hermits.[170] "That monk," etc., i.e., the impending danger... had drawn that
monk, etc.[171] A mountain near the head of Loch Lomond.[172] The Druids were the priests among the ancient Celtic nations
in Gaul and Britain.They worshiped in forests, regarded oaks and
mistletoe as sacred, and offered human sacrifices.V.

    Of Brian's birth strange tales were told.His mother watch'd a midnight fold,[173]
    Built deep within a dreary glen,
    Where scatter'd lay the bones of men,
    In some forgotten battle slain,
    And bleach'd by drifting wind and rain.It might have tamed a warrior's heart,
    To view such mockery of his art!The knot-grass fetter'd there the hand,
    Which once could burst an iron band;
    Beneath the broad and ample bone,
    That buckler'd heart to fear unknown,
    A feeble and a timorous guest,
    The field-fare[174] framed her lowly nest;
    There the slow blind-worm left his slime
    On the fleet limbs that mock'd at time;
    And there, too, lay the leader's skull,
    Still wreathed with chaplet, flush'd and full,
    For heath-bell, with her purple bloom,
    Supplied the bonnet and the plume.All night, in this sad glen, the maid
    Sate, shrouded in her mantle's shade:
    --She said, no shepherd sought her side,
    No hunter's hand her snood untied,
    Yet ne'er again, to braid her hair,
    The virgin snood did Alice wear;
    Gone was her maiden glee and sport,
    Her maiden girdle all too short;
    Nor sought she, from that fatal night,
    Or holy church, or blessed rite,
    But lock'd her secret in her breast,
    And died in travail, unconfess'd.Alone, among his young compeers,
    Was Brian from his infant years;
    A moody and heart-broken boy,
    Estranged from sympathy and joy,
    Bearing each taunt which careless tongue
    On his mysterious lineage flung.Whole nights he spent by moonlight pale,
    To wood and stream his hap to wail,
    Till, frantic, he as truth received
    What of his birth the crowd believed,
    And sought, in mist and meteor fire,
    To meet and know his Phantom Sire!In vain, to soothe his wayward fate,
    The cloister oped her pitying gate;
    In vain, the learning of the age
    Unclasp'd the sable-lettered[175] page;
    Even in its treasures he could find
    Food for the fever of his mind.Eager he read whatever tells
    Of magic, cabala,[176] and spells,
    And every dark pursuit allied
    To curious and presumptuous pride;
    Till, with fired brain and nerves o'erstrung,
    And heart with mystic horrors wrung,
    Desperate he sought Benharrow's den,
    And hid him from the haunts of men.[175] Black letter, the name of the Old English or modern Gothic
letters used in old manuscript and early printed books.The desert gave him visions wild,
    Such as might suit the specter's child.Where with black cliffs the torrents toil,
    He watch'd the wheeling eddies boil,
    Till, from their foam, his dazzled eyes
    Beheld the River Demon[177] rise;
    The mountain mist took form and limb,
    Of noontide hag, or goblin grim;
    The midnight wind came wild and dread,
    Swell'd with the voices of the dead;
    Far on the future battle heath
    His eye beheld the ranks of death:
    Thus the lone Seer, from mankind hurl'd,
    Shaped forth a disembodied world.One lingering sympathy of mind
    Still bound him to the mortal kind;
    The only parent he could claim
    Of ancient Alpine's lineage came.Late had he heard, in prophet's dream,
    The fatal Ben-Shie's[178] boding scream;
    Sounds,[179] too, had come in midnight blast,
    Of charging steeds, careering fast
    Along Benharrow's shingly side,
    Where mortal horseman ne'er might ride;
    The thunderbolt had split the pine,--
    All augur'd ill to Alpine's line.He girt his loins, and came to show
    The signals of impending woe,
    And now stood prompt to bless or ban,[180]
    As bade the Chieftain of his clan.[177] A malicious spirit supposed by the superstitious Scotch people to
inhabit lakes and rivers, and to forebode calamity.[178] A fairy supposed to indicate coming death or disaster by her
lamentations.[179] Sounds of the same foreboding character.'Twas all prepared;[181]--and from the rock,
    A goat, the patriarch of the flock,
    Before the kindling pile was laid,
    And pierced by Roderick's ready blade.Patient the sickening victim eyed
    The lifeblood ebb in crimson tide,
    Down his clogg'd beard and shaggy limb,
    Till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim.The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer,
    A slender crosslet form'd with care,
    A cubit's[182] length in measure due;
    The shaft and limbs were rods of yew,
    Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach[183] wave
    Their shadows o'er Clan-Alpine's grave,
    And, answering Lomond's breezes deep,
    Soothe many a chieftain's endless sleep.The Cross, thus form'd, he held on high,
    With wasted hand, and haggard eye,
    And strange and mingled feelings woke,
    While his anathema he spoke.[181] The ritual referred to in Canto III.[183] The Isles of Nuns in Loch Lomond, and place of burial of the
descendants of MacGregor."Woe to the clansman who shall view
    This symbol of sepulchral yew,
    Forgetful that its branches grew
    Where weep the heavens their holiest dew
      On Alpine's dwelling low!Deserter of his Chieftain's trust,
    He ne'er shall mingle with their dust,
    But, from his sires and kindred thrust,
    Each clansman's execration just
      Shall doom him wrath and woe."He paused;--the word the vassals took,
    With forward step and fiery look,
    On high their naked brands they shook,
    Their clattering targets wildly strook;[184]
      And first in murmur low,
    Then, like the billow in his course,
    That far to seaward finds his source,
    And flings to shore his muster'd force,
    Burst, with loud roar, their answer hoarse,
      "Woe to the traitor, woe!"Ben-an's gray scalp the accents knew,[185]
    The joyous wolf from covert drew,
    The exulting eagle scream'd afar,--
    They knew the voice of Alpine's war.[185] "Scalp," etc., i.e., summit the accents heard.X.

    The shout was hush'd on lake and fell,
    The monk resumed his mutter'd spell:
    Dismal and low its accents came,
    The while he scathed[186] the Cross with flame;
    And the few words that reach'd the air,
    Although the holiest name was there,
    Had more of blasphemy than prayer.But when he shook above the crowd
    Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:--
    "Woe to the wretch who fails to rear
    At this dread sign the ready spear!For, as the flames this symbol sear,
    His home, the refuge of his fear,
      A kindred fate shall know;
    Far o'er its roof the volumed flame
    Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,
    While maids and matrons on his name
    Shall call down wretchedness and shame,
      And infamy and woe."Then rose the cry of females, shrill
    As goshawk's whistle on the hill,
    Denouncing[187] misery and ill,
    Mingled with childhood's babbling trill
      Of curses stammer'd slow;
    Answering, with imprecation dread,
    "Sunk be his home in embers red!And cursed be the meanest shed
    That e'er shall hide the houseless head,
      We doom to want and woe!"A sharp and shrieking echo gave,
    Coir-Uriskin,[188] thy Goblin-cave!And the gray pass where birches wave
      On Beala-nam-bo.[189]

[186] Scorched; charred.[187] Upon the recreant who failed to respond to the "dread sign" of
the Fiery Cross.[188] A ravine of Benvenue supposed to be haunted by evil spirits.[189] The Pass of the Cattle, above Coir-Uriskin.Then deeper paused the priest anew,
    And hard his laboring breath he drew,
    While, with set teeth and clinched hand,
    And eyes that glow'd like fiery brand,
    He meditated curse more dread,
    And deadlier, on the clansman's head,
    Who, summon'd to his Chieftain's aid,
    The signal saw and disobeyed.The crosslet's points of sparkling wood
    He quenched among the bubbling blood,
    And, as again the sign he rear'd,
    Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:
    "When flits this Cross from man to man,
    Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,
    Burst be the ear that fails to heed!Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!May ravens tear the careless eyes,
    Wolves make the coward heart their prize!As sinks that blood stream in the earth,
    So may his heart's blood drench his hearth!As dies in hissing gore the spark,
    Quench thou his light, Destruction dark,
    And be the grace to him denied,
    Bought by this sign to all beside!"He ceased; no echo gave agen
    The murmur of the deep Amen.Then Roderick, with impatient look,
    From Brian's hand the symbol took:
    "Speed, Malise, speed!"he said, and gave
    The crosslet to his henchman brave."The muster-place be Lanrick mead[190]--
    Instant the time--speed, Malise, speed!"Like heath bird, when the hawks pursue,
    A barge across Loch Katrine flew;
    High stood the henchman on the prow;
    So rapidly the barge-men row,
    The bubbles, where they launch'd the boat,
    Were all unbroken and afloat,
    Dancing in foam and ripple still,
    When it had near'd the mainland hill;
    And from the silver beach's side
    Still was the prow three fathom wide,
    When lightly bounded to the land
    The messenger of blood and brand.[190] A meadow at the western end of Loch Vennachar.the dun deer's hide[191]
    On fleeter foot was never tied.such cause of haste
    Thine active sinews never braced.Bend 'gainst the steepy hill thy breast,
    Burst down like torrent from its crest;
    With short and springing footstep pass
    The trembling bog and false morass;
    Across the brook like roebuck bound,
    And thread the brake like questing[192] hound;
    The crag is high, the scaur is deep,
    Yet shrink not from the desperate leap:
    Parch'd are thy burning lips and brow,
    Yet by the fountain pause not now;
    Herald of battle, fate, and fear,
    Stretch onward in thy fleet career!The wounded hind thou track'st not now,
    Pursuest not maid through greenwood bough,
    Nor pliest thou now thy flying pace
    With rivals in the mountain race;
    But danger, death, and warrior deed
    Are in thy course--speed, Malise, speed![191] The shoes or buskins of the Highlanders were made of this hide.Fast as the fatal symbol flies,
    In arms the huts and hamlets rise;
    From winding glen, from upland brown,
    They pour'd each hardy tenant down.Nor slack'd the messenger his pace;
    He show'd the sign, he named the place,
    And, pressing forward like the wind,
    Left clamor and surprise behind.The fisherman forsook the strand,
    The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;
    With changed cheer,[193] the mower blithe
    Left in the half-cut swath the scythe;
    The herds without a keeper stray'd,
    The plow was in mid-furrow stayed,
    The falc'ner toss'd his hawk away,
    The hunter left the stag at bay;
    Prompt at the signal of alarms,
    Each son of Alpine rush'd to arms;
    So swept the tumult and affray
    Along the margin of Achray.that e'er
    Thy banks should echo sounds of fear!The rocks, the bosky[194] thickets, sleep
    So stilly on thy bosom deep,
    The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud,
    Seems for the scene too gayly loud.The lake is past,
    Duncraggan's[195] huts appear at last,
    And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen,
    Half hidden in the copse so green;
    There mayst thou rest, thy labor done,
    Their lord shall speed the signal on.--
    As stoops the hawk upon his prey,
    The henchman shot him down the way.--What woeful accents load the gale?A gallant hunter's sport is o'er,
    A valiant warrior fights no more.Who, in the battle or the chase,
    At Roderick's side shall fill his place!--
    Within the hall, where torch's ray
    Supplies the excluded beams of day,
    Lies Duncan on his lowly bier,
    And o'er him streams his widow's tear.His stripling son stands mournful by,
    His youngest weeps, but knows not why;
    The village maids and matrons round
    The dismal coronach[196] resound.[195] An estate between Lochs Achray and Vennachar.[196] The Scottish wail or song over the dead.He is gone on the mountain,
      He is lost to the forest,
    Like a summer-dried fountain,
      When our need was the sorest.The font, reappearing,
      From the raindrops shall borrow,
    But to us comes no cheering,
      To Duncan no morrow!The hand of the reaper
      Takes the ears that are hoary,
    But the voice of the weeper
      Wails manhood in glory.The autumn winds rushing
      Waft the leaves that are searest,
    But our flower was in flushing,[197]
      When blighting was nearest.Fleet foot on the correi,[198]
      Sage counsel in cumber,[199]
    Red hand in the foray,
      How sound is thy slumber!Like the dew on the mountain,
      Like the foam on the river,
    Like the bubble on the fountain,
      Thou art gone, and forever![198] The side of a hill which the game usually frequents.See Stumah,[200] who, the bier beside,
    His master's corpse with wonder eyed,
    Poor Stumah!whom his least halloo
    Could send like lightning o'er the dew,
    Bristles his crest, and points his ears,
    As if some stranger step he hears.'Tis not a mourner's muffled tread,
    Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead,
    But headlong haste, or deadly fear,
    Urge the precipitate career.All stand aghast:--unheeding all,
    The henchman bursts into the hall;
    Before the dead man's bier he stood;
    Held forth the Cross besmear'd with blood:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead;
    Speed forth the signal!Angus, the heir of Duncan's line,
    Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign.In haste the stripling to his side
    His father's dirk and broadsword tied;
    But when he saw his mother's eye
    Watch him in speechless agony,
    Back to her open'd arms he flew,
    Press'd on her lips a fond adieu--
    "Alas!"she sobb'd,--"and yet, begone,
    And speed thee forth, like Duncan's son!"One look he cast upon the bier,
    Dash'd from his eye the gathering tear,
    Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast,
    And toss'd aloft his bonnet crest,
    Then, like the high-bred colt, when, freed,
    First he essays his fire and speed,
    He vanish'd, and o'er moor and moss
    Sped forward with the Fiery Cross.Suspended was the widow's tear,
    While yet his footsteps she could hear;
    And when she mark'd the henchman's eye
    Wet with unwonted sympathy,
    "Kinsman," she said, "his race is run,
    That should have sped thine errand on;
    The oak has fall'n,--the sapling bough
    Is all Duncraggan's shelter now.Yet trust I well, his duty done,
    The orphan's God will guard my son.--
    And you, in many a danger true,
    At Duncan's hest[201] your blades that drew,
    To arms, and guard that orphan's head!Let babes and women wail the dead."Then weapon clang, and martial call,
    Resounded through the funeral hall,
    While from the walls the attendant band
    Snatch'd sword and targe, with hurried hand;
    And short and flitting energy
    Glanced from the mourner's sunken eye,
    As if the sounds to warrior dear
    Might rouse her Duncan from his bier.But faded soon that borrow'd force;
    Grief claim'd his right, and tears their course.Benledi saw the Cross of Fire,
    It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.[202]
    O'er dale and hill the summons flew,
    Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;
    The tear that gather'd in his eye
    He left the mountain breeze to dry;
    Until, where Teith's young waters roll,
    Betwixt him and a wooded knoll,
    That graced the sable strath with green,
    The chapel of St.Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge,
    But Angus paused not on the edge;
    Though the dark waves danced dizzily,
    Though reel'd his sympathetic eye,
    He dash'd amid the torrent's roar:
    His right hand high the crosslet bore,
    His left the poleax grasp'd, to guide
    And stay his footing in the tide.He stumbled twice--the foam splash'd high,
    With hoarser swell the stream raced by;
    And had he fall'n,--forever there,
    Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!But still, as if in parting life,
    Firmer he grasp'd the Cross of strife,
    Until the opposing bank he gain'd,
    And up the chapel pathway strain'd.[202] The valley in which Loch Lubnaig lies.A blithesome rout, that morning tide,[203]
    Had sought the chapel of St.Her troth Tombea's[204] Mary gave
    To Norman, heir of Armandave,[205]
    And, issuing from the Gothic arch,
    The bridal[206] now resumed their march.In rude, but glad procession, came
    Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame;
    And plaided youth, with jest and jeer,
    Which snooded maiden would not hear;
    And children, that, unwitting[207] why,
    Lent the gay shout their shrilly cry;
    And minstrels, that in measures vied
    Before the young and bonny bride,
    Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose
    The tear and blush of morning rose.With virgin step, and bashful hand,
    She held the kerchief's snowy band;
    The gallant bridegroom, by her side,
    Beheld his prize with victor's pride,
    And the glad mother in her ear
    Was closely whispering word of cheer.[204] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[205] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[206] Those composing the bridal procession.Haste in his hurried accent lies,
    And grief is swimming in his eyes.All dripping from the recent flood,
    Panting and travel-soil'd he stood,
    The fatal sign of fire and sword
    Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead--
    Speed forth the signal!And must he change so soon the hand,
    Just link'd to his by holy band,
    For the fell Cross of blood and brand?And must the day, so blithe that rose,
    And promised rapture in the close,
    Before its setting hour, divide
    The bridegroom from the plighted bride?Clan-Alpine's cause, her Chieftain's trust,
    Her summons dread, brook no delay;
    Stretch to the race--away!Yet slow he laid his plaid aside,
    And, lingering, eyed his lovely bride,
    Until he saw the starting tear
    Speak woe he might not stop to cheer;
    Then, trusting not a second look,
    In haste he sped him up the brook,
    Nor backward glanced, till on the heath
    Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith.--What in the racer's bosom stirr'd?The sickening pang of hope deferr'd,
    And memory, with a torturing train
    Of all his morning visions vain.Mingled with love's impatience, came
    The manly thirst for martial fame;
    The stormy joy of mountaineers,
    Ere yet they rush upon the spears;
    And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,
    And hope, from well-fought field returning,
    With war's red honors on his crest,
    To clasp his Mary to his breast.Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,
    Like fire from flint he glanced away,
    While high resolve, and feeling strong,
    Burst into voluntary song.The heath this night must be my bed,
    The bracken curtain for my head,
    My lullaby the warder's tread,
        Far, far from love and thee, Mary;
    To-morrow eve, more stilly laid,
    My couch may be my bloody plaid,
    My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid!I may not, dare not, fancy now
    The grief that clouds thy lovely brow;
    I dare not think upon thy vow,
        And all it promised me, Mary.No fond regret must Norman know;
    When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe,
    His heart must be like bended bow,
        His foot like arrow free, Mary.A time will come with feeling fraught,
    For, if I fall in battle fought,
    Thy hapless lover's dying thought
        Shall be a thought of thee, Mary.And if return'd from conquer'd foes,
    How blithely will the evening close,
    How sweet the linnet sing repose,
        To my young bride and me, Mary!Not faster o'er thy heathery braes,
    Balquhidder, speeds the midnight blaze,[208]
    Rushing, in conflagration strong,
    Thy deep ravines and dells along,
    Wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow,
    And reddening the dark lakes below;
    Nor faster speeds it, nor so far,
    As o'er thy heaths the voice of war.The signal roused to martial coil[209]
    The sullen margin of Loch Voil,
    Waked still Loch Doine, and to the source
    Alarm'd, Balvaig, thy swampy course;
    Thence southward turn'd its rapid road
    Adown Strath-Gartney's valley broad,
    Till rose in arms each man might claim
    A portion in Clan-Alpine's name,
    From the gray sire, whose trembling hand
    Could hardly buckle on his brand,
    To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow
    Were yet scarce terror to the crow.Each valley, each sequester'd glen,
    Muster'd its little horde of men,
    That met as torrents from the height
    In Highland dales their streams unite,
    Still gathering, as they pour along,
    A voice more loud, a tide more strong,
    Till at the rendezvous they stood
    By hundreds prompt for blows and blood;
    Each train'd to arms since life began,
    Owning no tie but to his clan,
    No oath, but by his Chieftain's hand,
    No law, but Roderick Dhu's command.[208] Blaze of the heather, which is often set on fire by the shepherds
to facilitate a growth of young herbage for the sheep.That summer morn had Roderick Dhu
    Survey'd the skirts of Benvenue,
    And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,
    To view the frontiers of Menteith.All backward came with news of truce;
    Still lay each martial Graeme[210] and Bruce,[211]
    In Rednock[212] courts no horsemen wait,
    No banner waved on Cardross[213] gate,
    On Duchray's[214] towers no beacon shone,
    Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;
    All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye why
    The Chieftain, with such anxious eye,
    Ere to the muster he repair,
    This western frontier scann'd with care?--
    In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,
    A fair, though cruel, pledge was left;
    For Douglas, to his promise true,
    That morning from the isle withdrew,
    And in a deep sequester'd dell
    Had sought a low and lonely cell.By many a bard, in Celtic tongue,
    Has Coir-nan-Uriskin[215] been sung;
    A softer name the Saxons gave,
    And called the grot the Goblin-cave.[210] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[211] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[212] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[213] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[214] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.It was a wild and strange retreat,
    As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.The dell, upon the mountain's crest,
    Yawn'd like a gash on warrior's breast;
    Its trench had stayed full many a rock,
    Hurl'd by primeval earthquake shock
    From Benvenue's gray summit wild,
    And here, in random ruin piled,
    They frown'd incumbent o'er the spot,
    And form'd the rugged silvan grot.The oak and birch, with mingled shade,
    At noontide there a twilight made,
    Unless when short and sudden shone
    Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,
    With such a glimpse as prophet's eye
    Gains on thy depth, Futurity.No murmur waked the solemn still,[216]
    Save tinkling of a fountain rill;
    But when the wind chafed with the lake,
    A sullen sound would upward break,
    With dashing hollow voice, that spoke
    The incessant war of wave and rock.Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,
    Seem'd nodding o'er the cavern gray.From such a den the wolf had sprung,
    In such the wild-cat leaves her young;
    Yet Douglas and his daughter fair
    Sought for a space their safety there.Gray Superstition's whisper dread
    Debarr'd the spot to vulgar tread;
    For there, she said, did fays resort,
    And satyrs[217] hold their silvan court,
    By moonlight tread their mystic maze,
    And blast the rash beholder's gaze.[217] Silvan deities of Greek mythology, with head and body of a man
and legs of a goat.Now eve, with western shadows long,
    Floated on Katrine bright and strong,
    When Roderick, with a chosen few,
    Repass'd the heights of Benvenue.Above the Goblin-cave they go,
    Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo:
    The prompt retainers speed before,
    To launch the shallop from the shore,
    For 'cross Loch Katrine lies his way
    To view the passes of Achray,
    And place his clansmen in array.Yet lags the Chief in musing mind,
    Unwonted sight, his men behind.A single page, to bear his sword,
    Alone attended on his lord;
    The rest their way through thickets break,
    And soon await him by the lake.It was a fair and gallant sight,
    To view them from the neighboring height,
    By the low-level'd sunbeam's light!For strength and stature, from the clan
    Each warrior was a chosen man,
    As even afar might well be seen,
    By their proud step and martial mien.Their feathers dance, their tartans float,
    Their targets gleam, as by the boat
    A wild and warlike group they stand,
    That well became such mountain strand.Their Chief, with step reluctant, still
    Was lingering on the craggy hill,
    Hard by where turn'd apart the road
    To Douglas's obscure abode.It was but with that dawning morn,
    That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn
    To drown his love in war's wild roar,
    Nor think of Ellen Douglas more;
    But he who stems[218] a stream with sand,
    And fetters flame with flaxen band,
    Has yet a harder task to prove--
    By firm resolve to conquer love!Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost,
    Still hovering near his treasure lost;
    For though his haughty heart deny
    A parting meeting to his eye,
    Still fondly strains his anxious ear,
    The accents of her voice to hear,
    And inly did he curse the breeze
    That waked to sound the rustling trees.It is the harp of Allan-Bane,
    That wakes its measure slow and high,
    Attuned to sacred minstrelsy.'Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings._Ave Maria!_[219] maiden mild!Thou canst hear though from the wild,
      Thou canst save amid despair.Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,
      Though banish'd, outcast, and reviled--
    Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ undefiled!The flinty couch we now must share
    Shall seem with down of eider[220] piled,
      If thy protection hover there.The murky cavern's heavy air
      Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;
    Then, Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ stainless styled!Foul demons of the earth and air,
    From this their wonted haunt exiled,
      Shall flee before thy presence fair.We bow us to our lot of care,
      Beneath thy guidance reconciled;
    Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer!_Ave Maria!_

[219] Hail, Mary!The beginning of the Roman Catholic prayer to the
Virgin Mary.[220] "Down of eider," i.e., the soft breast feathers of the eider duck.Died on the harp the closing hymn.--
    Unmoved in attitude and limb,
    As list'ning still, Clan-Alpine's lord
    Stood leaning on his heavy sword,
    Until the page, with humble sign,
    Twice pointed to the sun's decline.Then while his plaid he round him cast,
    "It is the last time--'tis the last,"
    He mutter'd thrice,--"the last time e'er
    That angel voice shall Roderick hear!"It was a goading thought--his stride
    Hied hastier down the mountain side;
    Sullen he flung him in the boat,
    And instant 'cross the lake it shot.They landed in that silvery bay,
    And eastward held their hasty way,
    Till, with the latest beams of light,
    The band arrived on Lanrick height,
    Where muster'd, in the vale below,
    Clan-Alpine's men in martial show.A various scene the clansmen made;
    Some sate, some stood, some slowly stray'd;
    But most, with mantles folded round,
    Were couch'd to rest upon the ground,
    Scarce to be known by curious eye,
    From the deep heather where they lie,
    So well was match'd the tartan screen
    With heath bell dark and brackens green;
    Unless where, here and there, a blade,
    Or lance's point, a glimmer made,
    Like glowworm twinkling through the shade.But when, advancing through the gloom,
    They saw the Chieftain's eagle plume,
    Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide,
    Shook the steep mountain's steady side.Thrice it arose, and lake and fell
    Three times return'd the martial yell;
    It died upon Bochastle's plain,
    And Silence claim'd her evening reign."The rose is fairest when 'tis budding new,
      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears;
    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,
      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.O wilding[221] rose, whom fancy thus endears,
      I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave,
    Emblem of hope and love through future years!"--
      Thus spoke young Norman, heir of Armandave,
    What time the sun arose on Vennachar's broad wave.Such fond conceit, half said, half sung,
    Love prompted to the bridegroom's tongue,
    All while he stripp'd the wild-rose spray.His ax and bow beside him lay,
    For on a pass 'twixt lake and wood,
    A wakeful sentinel he stood.on the rock a footstep rung,
    And instant to his arms he sprung."Stand, or thou diest!--What, Malise?--soon
    Art thou return'd from Braes of Doune.By thy keen step and glance I know,
    Thou bring'st us tidings of the foe."--
    (For while the Fiery Cross hied on,
    On distant scout had Malise gone.)the henchman said.--
    "Apart, in yonder misty glade;
    To his lone couch I'll be your guide."--
    Then call'd a slumberer by his side,
    And stirr'd him with his slacken'd bow--
    "Up, up, Glentarkin!We seek the Chieftain; on the track,
    Keep eagle watch till I come back."Together up the pass they sped:
    "What of the foemen?"Norman said.--
    "Varying reports from near and far;
    This certain,--that a band of war
    Has for two days been ready boune,[222]
    At prompt command, to march from Doune;
    King James, the while, with princely powers,
    Holds revelry in Stirling towers.Soon will this dark and gathering cloud
    Speak on our glens in thunder loud.Inured to bide such bitter bout,
    The warrior's plaid may bear it out;[223]
    But, Norman, how wilt thou provide
    A shelter for thy bonny bride?"know ye not that Roderick's care
    To the lone isle hath caused repair
    Each maid and matron of the clan,
    And every child and aged man
    Unfit for arms; and given his charge,[224]
    Nor skiff nor shallop, boat nor barge,
    Upon these lakes shall float at large,
    But all beside the islet moor,
    That such dear pledge may rest secure?"--

[222] "Boune" itself means "ready" in Scotch: hence its use here is
tautology.[223] "Inured to bide," etc., i.e., accustomed to endure privations,
the warrior may withstand the coming storm."'Tis well advised--the Chieftain's plan
    Bespeaks the father of his clan.But wherefore sleeps Sir Roderick Dhu
    Apart from all his followers true?"--
    "It is, because last evening-tide
    Brian an augury hath tried,
    Of that dread kind which must not be
    Unless in dread extremity;
    The Taghairm[225] call'd; by which, afar,
    Our sires foresaw the events of war.Duncraggan's milk-white bull they slew."The choicest of the prey we had,
    When swept our merry men Gallangad.[226]
    His hide was snow, his horns were dark,
    His red eye glow'd like fiery spark;
    So fierce, so tameless, and so fleet,
    Sore did he cumber our retreat,
    And kept our stoutest kernes[227] in awe,
    Even at the pass of Beal'maha.But steep and flinty was the road,
    And sharp the hurrying pikeman's goad,
    And when we came to Dennan's Row,
    A child might scathless[228] stroke his brow."[225] An old Highland mode of "reading the future.""A person was
wrapped up in the skin of a newly slain bullock, and deposited beside a
waterfall, or at the bottom of a precipice, or in some other strange,
wild, and unusual situation.In this situation he revolved in his
mind the question proposed, and whatever was impressed upon him by
his exalted imagination passed for the inspiration of the disembodied
spirits who haunt the desolate recesses."--_Scott._

[226] South of Loch Lomond."That bull was slain: his reeking hide
    They stretch'd the cataract beside,
    Whose waters their wild tumult toss
    Adown the black and craggy boss
    Of that huge cliff, whose ample verge
    Tradition calls the Hero's Targe.Couch'd on a shelve beneath its brink,
    Close where the thundering torrents sink,
    Rocking beneath their headlong sway,
    And drizzled by the ceaseless spray,
    Midst groan of rock, and roar of stream,
    The wizard waits prophetic dream.Nor distant rests the Chief;--but hush!See, gliding slow through mist and bush,
    The Hermit gains yon rock, and stands
    To gaze upon our slumbering bands.Seems he not, Malise, like a ghost,
    That hovers o'er a slaughter'd host?Or raven on the blasted oak,
    That, watching while the deer is broke,[229]
    His morsel claims with sullen croak?"to other than to me,
    Thy words were evil augury;
    But still I hold Sir Roderick's blade
    Clan-Alpine's omen and her aid,
    Not aught that, glean'd from heaven or hell,
    Yon fiend-begotten monk can tell.The Chieftain joins him, see--and now,
    Together they descend the brow."And, as they came, with Alpine's lord
    The Hermit Monk held solemn word:--
    "Roderick!it is a fearful strife,
    For man endowed with mortal life,
    Whose shroud of sentient clay can still
    Feel feverish pang and fainting chill,
    Whose eye can stare in stony trance,
    Whose hair can rouse like warrior's lance,--
    'Tis hard for such to view, unfurl'd,
    The curtain of the future world.Yet, witness every quaking limb,
    My sunken pulse, my eyeballs dim,
    My soul with harrowing anguish torn,
    This for my Chieftain have I borne!--
    The shapes that sought my fearful couch,
    A human tongue may ne'er avouch;
    No mortal man,--save he, who, bred
    Between the living and the dead,
    Is gifted beyond nature's law,--
    Had e'er survived to say he saw.At length the fateful answer came,
    In characters of living flame!Not spoke in word, nor blazed[230] in scroll,
    But borne and branded on my soul;--
    WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN'S LIFE,
    THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE."--

[230] Emblazoned."Thanks, Brian, for thy zeal and care!Good is thine augury, and fair.Clan-Alpine ne'er in battle stood,
    But first our broadswords tasted blood.A surer victim still I know,
    Self-offer'd to the auspicious blow:
    A spy has sought my land this morn,--
    No eve shall witness his return!My followers guard each pass's mouth,
    To east, to westward, and to south;
    Red Murdoch, bribed to be his guide,
    Has charge to lead his steps aside,
    Till, in deep path or dingle brown,
    He light on those shall bring him down.--But see, who comes his news to show!"At Doune, o'er many a spear and glaive[231]
    Two Barons proud their banners wave.I saw the Moray's silver star,
    And mark'd the sable pale[232] of Mar."--
    "By Alpine's soul, high tidings those!--"To-morrow's noon
    Will see them here for battle boune."--
    "Then shall it see a meeting stern!--
    But, for the place--say, couldst thou learn
    Naught of the friendly clans of Earn?[233]
    Strengthened by them, we well might bide
    The battle on Benledi's side.Clan-Alpine's men
    Shall man the Trosachs' shaggy glen;
    Within Loch Katrine's gorge we'll fight,
    All in our maids' and matrons' sight,
    Each for his hearth and household fire,
    Father for child, and son for sire,
    Lover for maid beloved!--But why--
    Is it the breeze affects mine eye?Or dost thou come, ill-omened tear!sooner may the Saxon lance
    Unfix Benledi from his stance,[234]
    Than doubt or terror can pierce through
    The unyielding heart of Roderick Dhu!'Tis stubborn as his trusty targe.Each to his post--all know their charge."The pibroch sounds, the bands advance,
    The broadswords gleam, the banners dance,
    Obedient to the Chieftain's glance.--I turn me from the martial roar,
    And seek Coir-Uriskin once more.[232] Black band in the coat of arms of the Earls of Mar.Where is the Douglas?--he is gone;
    And Ellen sits on the gray stone
    Fast by the cave, and makes her moan;
    While vainly Allan's words of cheer
    Are pour'd on her unheeding ear.--
    "He will return--Dear lady, trust!--
    With joy return;--he will--he must.Well was it time to seek, afar,
    Some refuge from impending war,
    When e'en Clan-Alpine's rugged swarm
    Are cow'd by the approaching storm.I saw their boats, with many a light,
    Floating the livelong yesternight,
    Shifting like flashes darted forth
    By the red streamers of the north;[235]
    I mark'd at morn how close they ride,
    Thick moor'd by the lone islet's side,
    Like wild ducks couching in the fen,
    When stoops the hawk upon the glen.Since this rude race dare not abide
    The peril on the mainland side,
    Shall not thy noble father's care
    Some safe retreat for thee prepare?"--

[235] "Red streamers," etc., i.e., the aurora borealis.Pretext so kind
    My wakeful terrors could not blind.When in such tender tone, yet grave,
    Douglas a parting blessing gave,
    The tear that glisten'd in his eye
    Drown'd not his purpose fix'd and high.My soul, though feminine and weak,
    Can image his; e'en as the lake,
    Itself disturb'd by slightest stroke,
    Reflects the invulnerable rock.He hears report of battle rife,
    He deems himself the cause of strife.I saw him redden, when the theme
    Turn'd, Allan, on thine idle dream
    Of Malcolm Graeme in fetters bound,
    Which I, thou saidst, about him wound.Think'st thou he trow'd[236] thine omen aught?'twas apprehensive thought
    For the kind youth,--for Roderick too--
    (Let me be just) that friend so true;
    In danger both, and in our cause!Minstrel, the Douglas dare not pause.Why else that solemn warning given,
    'If not on earth, we meet in heaven?'Why else, to Cambus-kenneth's fane,[237]
    If eve return him not again,
    Am I to hie, and make me known?he goes to Scotland's throne,
    Buys his friend's safety with his own;
    He goes to do--what I had done,
    Had Douglas' daughter been his son!"This abbey is not far from Stirling."Nay, lovely Ellen!--dearest, nay!If aught should his return delay,
    He only named yon holy fane
    As fitting place to meet again.Be sure he's safe; and for the Graeme,--
    Heaven's blessing on his gallant name!--
    My vision'd sight may yet prove true,
    Nor bode[238] of ill to him or you.When did my gifted[239] dream beguile?[240]
    Think of the stranger at the isle,
    And think upon the harpings slow,
    That presaged this approaching woe!Sooth was my prophecy of fear;
    Believe it when it augurs cheer.Ill luck still haunts a fairy grot.Of such a wondrous tale I know--
    Dear lady, change that look of woe,
    My harp was wont thy grief to cheer.""Well, be it as thou wilt; I hear,
    But cannot stop the bursting tear."The Minstrel tried his simple art,
    But distant far was Ellen's heart._Alice Brand._

    Merry it is in the good greenwood,
      When the mavis[241] and merle[242] are singing,
    When the deer sweeps by, and the hounds are in cry,
      And the hunter's horn is ringing."O Alice Brand, my native land
      Is lost for love of you;
    And we must hold by wood and wold,[243]
      As outlaws wont to do."O Alice, 'twas all for thy locks so bright,
      And 'twas all for thine eyes so blue,
    That on the night of our luckless flight,
      Thy brother bold I slew."Now must I teach to hew the beech
      The hand that held the glaive,
    For leaves to spread our lowly bed,
      And stakes to fence our cave."And for vest of pall,[244] thy finger small,
      That wont on harp to stray,
    A cloak must shear from the slaughter'd deer,
      To keep the cold away."if my brother died,
      'Twas but a fatal chance;
    For darkling[245] was the battle tried,
      And fortune sped the lance."If pall and vair[246] no more I wear,
      Nor thou the crimson sheen,
    As warm, we'll say, is the russet[247] gray,
      As gay the forest-green.[248]

    "And, Richard, if our lot be hard,
      And lost thy native land,
    Still Alice has her own Richard,
      And he his Alice Brand."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      So blithe Lady Alice is singing;
    On the beech's pride, and oak's brown side,
      Lord Richard's ax is ringing.Up spoke the moody Elfin King,
      Who won'd[249] within the hill,--
    Like wind in the porch of a ruin'd church,
      His voice was ghostly shrill."Why sounds yon stroke on beech and oak,
      Our moonlight circle's screen?Or who comes here to chase the deer,
      Beloved of our Elfin Queen?Or who may dare on wold to wear
      The fairies' fatal green!to yon mortal hie,
      For thou wert christen'd man;
    For cross or sign thou wilt not fly,
      For mutter'd word or ban."Lay on him the curse of the wither'd heart,
      The curse of the sleepless eye;
    Till he wish and pray that his life would part,
      Nor yet find leave to die."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      Though the birds have still'd their singing!The evening blaze doth Alice raise,
      And Richard is fagots bringing.Up Urgan starts, that hideous dwarf,
      Before Lord Richard stands,
    And, as he cross'd and bless'd himself,
    "I fear not sign," quoth the grisly elf,
      "That is made with bloody hands."But out then spoke she, Alice Brand,
      That woman void of fear,--
    "And if there's blood upon his hand,
      'Tis but the blood of deer."--

    "Now loud thou liest, thou bold of mood!It cleaves unto his hand,
    The stain of thine own kindly[250] blood,
      The blood of Ethert Brand."Then forward stepp'd she, Alice Brand,
      And made the holy sign,--
    "And if there's blood on Richard's hand,
      A spotless hand is mine."And I conjure thee, demon elf,
      By Him whom demons fear,
    To show us whence thou art thyself,
      And what thine errand here?""'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in Fairyland,
      When fairy birds are singing,
    When the court doth ride by their monarch's side,
      With bit and bridle ringing:

    "And gayly shines the Fairyland--
      But all is glistening show,
    Like the idle gleam that December's beam
      Can dart on ice and snow."And fading, like that varied gleam,
      Is our inconstant shape,
    Who now like knight and lady seem,
      And now like dwarf and ape."It was between the night and day,
      When the Fairy King has power,
    That I sunk down in a sinful fray,
    And, 'twixt life and death, was snatched away
      To the joyless Elfin bower."But wist[251] I of a woman bold,
      Who thrice my brow durst sign,
    I might regain my mortal mold,
      As fair a form as thine."She cross'd him once--she cross'd him twice--
      That lady was so brave;
    The fouler grew his goblin hue,
      The darker grew the cave.She cross'd him thrice, that lady bold;
      He rose beneath her hand
    The fairest knight on Scottish mold,
      Her brother, Ethert Brand!Merry it is in good greenwood,
      When the mavis and merle are singing,
    But merrier were they in Dunfermline[252] gray,
      When all the bells were ringing.[252] A town in Fifeshire, thirteen miles northwest of Edinburgh, the
residence of the early Scottish kings.Its Abbey of the Gray Friars was
the royal burial place.Just as the minstrel sounds were stayed,
    A stranger climb'd the steepy glade;
    His martial step, his stately mien,
    His hunting suit of Lincoln green,
    His eagle glance, remembrance claims--
    'Tis Snowdoun's Knight, 'tis James Fitz-James.Ellen beheld as in a dream,
    Then, starting, scarce suppress'd a scream:
    "O stranger!in such hour of fear,
    What evil hap has brought thee here?"--
    "An evil hap how can it be,
    That bids me look again on thee?By promise bound, my former guide
    Met me betimes this morning tide,
    And marshal'd, over bank and bourne,[253]
    The happy path of my return."--
    "The happy path!--what!said he naught
    Of war, of battle to be fought,
    Of guarded pass?"Nor saw I aught could augur scathe."[254]--
    "Oh haste thee, Allan, to the kern,[255]
    --Yonder his tartans I discern;
    Learn thou his purpose, and conjure
    That he will guide the stranger sure!--
    What prompted thee, unhappy man?The meanest serf in Roderick's clan
    Had not been bribed by love or fear,
    Unknown to him to guide thee here."Referring to the treacherous guide, Red Murdoch
(see Stanza VII."Sweet Ellen, dear my life must be,
    Since it is worthy care from thee;
    Yet life I hold but idle breath,
    When love or honor's weigh'd with death.Then let me profit by my chance,
    And speak my purpose bold at once.I come to bear thee from a wild,
    Where ne'er before such blossom smiled;
    By this soft hand to lead thee far
    From frantic scenes of feud and war.Near Bochastle my horses wait;
    They bear us soon to Stirling gate.I'll place thee in a lovely bower,
    I'll guard thee like a tender flower"--
    "Oh!'twere female art,
    To say I do not read thy heart;
    Too much, before, my selfish ear
    Was idly soothed my praise to hear.That fatal bait hath lured thee back,
    In deathful hour, o'er dangerous track;
    And how, oh how, can I atone
    The wreck my vanity brought on!--
    One way remains--I'll tell him all--
    Yes!struggling bosom, forth it shall!Thou, whose light folly bears the blame
    Buy thine own pardon with thy shame!But first--my father is a man
    Outlaw'd and exiled, under ban;
    The price of blood is on his head,
    With me 'twere infamy to wed.--
    Still wouldst thou speak?--then hear the truth!Fitz-James, there is a noble youth,--
    If yet he is!--exposed for me
    And mine to dread extremity[256]--
    Thou hast the secret of my heart;
    Forgive, be generous, and depart!"Fitz-James knew every wily train[257]
    A lady's fickle heart to gain;
    But here he knew and felt them vain.There shot no glance from Ellen's eye,
    To give her steadfast speech the lie;
    In maiden confidence she stood,
    Though mantled in her cheek the blood,
    And told her love with such a sigh
    Of deep and hopeless agony,
    As[258] death had seal'd her Malcolm's doom,
    And she sat sorrowing on his tomb.Hope vanish'd from Fitz-James's eye,
    But not with hope fled sympathy.He proffer'd to attend her side,
    As brother would a sister guide.--
    "Oh!little know'st thou Roderick's heart!Oh haste thee, and from Allan learn,
    If thou mayst trust yon wily kern."With hand upon his forehead laid,
    The conflict of his mind to shade,
    A parting step or two he made;
    Then, as some thought had cross'd his brain,
    He paused, and turn'd, and came again."Hear, lady, yet, a parting word!--
    It chanced in fight that my poor sword
    Preserved the life of Scotland's lord.This ring the grateful Monarch gave,
    And bade, when I had boon to crave,
    To bring it back, and boldly claim
    The recompense that I would name.Ellen, I am no courtly lord,
    But one who lives by lance and sword,
    Whose castle is his helm and shield,
    His lordship the embattled field.What from a prince can I demand,
    Who neither reck[259] of state nor land?Ellen, thy hand--the ring is thine;
    Each guard and usher knows the sign.Seek thou the King without delay;
    This signet shall secure thy way;
    And claim thy suit, whate'er it be,
    As ransom of his pledge to me."He placed the golden circlet on,
    Paused--kiss'd her hand--and then was gone.The aged Minstrel stood aghast,
    So hastily Fitz-James shot past.He join'd his guide, and wending down
    The ridges of the mountain brown,
    Across the stream they took their way,
    That joins Loch Katrine to Achray.All in the Trosachs' glen was still,
    Noontide was sleeping on the hill:
    Sudden his guide whoop'd loud and high--
    "Murdoch!--
    He stammer'd forth--"I shout to scare
    Yon raven from his dainty fare."He look'd--he knew the raven's prey,
    His own brave steed:--"Ah!For thee--for me, perchance--'twere well
    We ne'er had seen the Trosachs' dell.--
    Murdoch, move first--but silently;
    Whistle or whoop, and thou shalt die!"Jealous and sullen, on they fared,
    Each silent, each upon his guard.Now wound the path its dizzy ledge
    Around a precipice's edge,
    When lo!a wasted female form,
    Blighted by wrath of sun and storm,
    In tatter'd weeds[260] and wild array,
    Stood on a cliff beside the way,
    And glancing round her restless eye,
    Upon the wood, the rock, the sky,
    Seem'd naught to mark, yet all to spy.Her brow was wreath'd with gaudy broom;
    With gesture wild she waved a plume
    Of feathers, which the eagles fling
    To crag and cliff from dusky wing;
    Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
    Where scarce was footing for the goat.The tartan plaid she first descried,
    And shriek'd till all the rocks replied;
    As loud she laugh'd when near they drew,
    For then the Lowland garb she knew;
    And then her hands she wildly wrung,
    And then she wept, and then she sung--
    She sung!--the voice, in better time,
    Perchance to harp or lute might chime;
    And now, though strain'd and roughen'd, still
    Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,
      They say my brain is warp'd[261] and wrung--
    I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
      I cannot pray in Highland tongue.But were I now where Allan[262] glides,
    Or heard my native Devan's[263] tides,
    So sweetly would I rest, and pray
    That Heaven would close my wintry day!'Twas thus my hair they bade me braid,
      They made me to the church repair;
    It was my bridal morn, they said,
      And my true love would meet me there.But woe betide the cruel guile,
    That drown'd in blood the morning smile![262] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.[263] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.She hovers o'er the hollow way,
    And flutters wide her mantle gray,
    As the lone heron spreads his wing,
    By twilight, o'er a haunted spring."--
    "'Tis Blanche of Devan," Murdoch said,
    "A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
    Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
    When Roderick foray'd Devan-side;
    The gay bridegroom resistance made,
    And felt our Chief's unconquer'd blade.I marvel she is now at large,
    But oft she'scapes from Maudlin's charge.--
    Hence, brain-sick fool!"--He raised his bow:--
    "Now, if thou strikest her but one blow,
    I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
    As ever peasant pitch'd a bar!"[264]--
    "Thanks, champion, thanks!"the maniac cried,
    And press'd her to Fitz-James's side."See the gray pennons I prepare,
    To seek my true love through the air!I will not lend that savage groom,
    To break his fall, one downy plume!No!--deep amid disjointed stones,
    The wolves shall batten[265] on his bones,
    And then shall his detested plaid,
    By bush and brier in mid air stayed,
    Wave forth a banner fair and free,
    Meet signal for their revelry."--

[264] "Pitching the bar" was a favorite athletic sport in Scotland."Hush thee, poor maiden, and be still!"thou look'st kindly, and I will.--
    Mine eye has dried and wasted been,
    But still it loves the Lincoln green;
    And, though mine ear is all unstrung,
    Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue."For oh my sweet William was forester true,
      He stole poor Blanche's heart away!His coat it was all of the greenwood hue,
      And so blithely he trill'd the Lowland lay!"It was not that I meant to tell...
    But thou art wise, and guessest well."Then, in a low and broken tone,
    And hurried note, the song went on.Still on the Clansman, fearfully,
    She fixed her apprehensive eye;
    Then turn'd it on the Knight, and then
    Her look glanced wildly o'er the glen."The toils are pitch'd, and the stakes are set,
      Ever sing merrily, merrily;
    The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
      Hunters live so cheerily."It was a stag, a stag of ten,[266]
      Bearing its branches sturdily;
    He came stately down the glen,
      Ever sing hardily, hardily."It was there he met with a wounded doe,
      She was bleeding deathfully;
    She warn'd him of the toils below,
      Oh, so faithfully, faithfully!"He had an eye, and he could heed,
      Ever sing warily, warily;
    He had a foot, and he could speed--
      Hunters watch so narrowly."[267]

[266] Having antlers with ten branches.[267] "The hunters are Clan-Alpine's men; the stag of ten is
Fitz-James; the wounded doe is herself!"Fitz-James's mind was passion-toss'd,
    When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
    But Murdoch's shout suspicion wrought,
    And Blanche's song conviction brought.--
    Not like a stag that spies the snare,
    But lion of the hunt aware,
    He waved at once his blade on high,
    "Disclose thy treachery, or die!"Forth at full speed the Clansman flew,
    But in his race his bow he drew.The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
    And thrill'd in Blanche's faded breast.--
    Murdoch of Alpine!prove thy speed,
    For ne'er had Alpine's son such need!With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
    The fierce avenger is behind!Fate judges of the rapid strife--
    The forfeit[268] death--the prize is life!Thy kindred ambush lies before,
    Close couch'd upon the heathery moor;
    Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be--
    Thine ambush'd kin thou ne'er shalt see,
    The fiery Saxon gains on thee!--Resistless speeds the deadly thrust,
    As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
    With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain,
    Ere he can win his blade again.Bent o'er the fall'n, with falcon eye,
    He grimly smiled to see him die;
    Then slower wended back his way,
    Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.She sate beneath the birchen tree,
    Her elbow resting on her knee;
    She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
    And gazed on it, and feebly laugh'd;
    Her wreath of broom and feathers gray,
    Daggled[269] with blood, beside her lay.The Knight to stanch the life-stream tried,--
    "Stranger, it is in vain!""This hour of death has given me more
    Of reason's power than years before;
    For, as these ebbing veins decay,
    My frenzied visions fade away.A helpless injured wretch I die,
    And something tells me in thine eye,
    That thou wert mine avenger born.--
    Seest thou this tress?--Oh!still I've worn
    This little tress of yellow hair,
    Through danger, frenzy, and despair!It once was bright and clear as thine,
    But blood and tears have dimm'd its shine.I will not tell thee when 'twas shred,
    Nor from what guiltless victim's head--
    My brain would turn!--but it shall wave
    Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
    Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
    And thou wilt bring it me again.--
    I waver still.--O God!more bright
    Let reason beam her parting light!--
    Oh!by thy knighthood's honor'd sign,
    And for thy life preserved by mine,
    When thou shalt see a darksome man,
    Who boasts him Chief of Alpine's Clan,
    With tartans broad, and shadowy plume,
    And hand of blood, and brow of gloom,
    Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
    And wreak[270] poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!They watch for thee by pass and fell...
    Avoid the path... O God!...A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James;
    Fast pour'd his eyes at pity's claims;
    And now with mingled grief and ire,
    He saw the murder'd maid expire."God, in my need, be my relief,
    As I wreak this on yonder Chief!"A lock from Blanche's tresses fair
    He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
    The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
    And placed it on his bonnet-side:
    "By Him whose word is truth!I swear,
    No other favor will I wear,
    Till this sad token I imbrue
    In the best blood of Roderick Dhu.The chase is up,--but they shall know,
    The stag at bay's a dangerous foe."Barr'd from the known but guarded way,
    Through copse and cliffs Fitz-James must stray,
    And oft must change his desperate track,
    By stream and precipice turn'd back.Heartless, fatigued, and faint, at length,
    From lack of food and loss of strength,
    He couch'd him in a thicket hoar,
    And thought his toils and perils o'er:--
    "Of all my rash adventures past,
    This frantic feat must prove the last!Who e'er so mad but might have guess'd,
    That all this Highland hornet's nest
    Would muster up in swarms so soon
    As e'er they heard of bands[271] at Doune?Like bloodhounds now they search me out,--
    Hark, to the whistle and the shout!--
    If farther through the wilds I go,
    I only fall upon the foe:
    I'll couch me here till evening gray,
    Then darkling try my dangerous way."The shades of eve come slowly down,
    The woods are wrapt in deeper brown,
    The owl awakens from her dell,
    The fox is heard upon the fell;
    Enough remains of glimmering light
    To guide the wanderer's steps aright,
    Yet not enough from far to show
    His figure to the watchful foe.With cautious step, and ear awake,
    He climbs the crag and threads the brake;
    And not the summer solstice,[272] there,
    Temper'd the midnight mountain air,
    But every breeze, that swept the wold,
    Benumb'd his drenched limbs with cold.In dread, in danger, and alone,
    Famish'd and chill'd, through ways unknown,
    Tangled and steep, he journey'd on;
    Till, as a rock's huge point he turn'd,
    A watch fire close before him burn'd.Beside its embers red and clear,
    Bask'd, in his plaid, a mountaineer;
    And up he sprung with sword in hand,--
    "Thy name and purpose?--
    "Rest and a guide, and food and fire.My life's beset, my path is lost,
    The gale has chill'd my limbs with frost."--
    "Art thou a friend to Roderick?"--"No."--
    "Thou darest not call thyself a foe?"to him and all the band
    He brings to aid his murderous hand."--
    "Bold words!--but, though the beast of game
    The privilege of chase may claim,
    Though space and law the stag we lend,
    Ere hound we slip,[273] or bow we bend,
    Who ever reck'd, where, how, or when,
    The prowling fox was trapp'd or slain?Thus treacherous scouts,--yet sure they lie,
    Who say them earnest a secret spy!"--
    "They do, by Heaven!--Come Roderick Dhu,
    And of his clan the boldest two,
    And let me but till morning rest,
    I write the falsehood on their crest."--
    "If by the blaze I mark aright,
    Thou bear'st the belt and spur of Knight."--
    "Then by these tokens mayest thou know
    Each proud oppressor's mortal foe."--
    "Enough, enough;--sit down, and share
    A soldier's couch, a soldier's fare."He gave him of his Highland cheer,
    The harden'd flesh of mountain deer;
    Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
    And bade the Saxon share his plaid.He tended him like welcome guest,
    Then thus his farther speech address'd:--
    "Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
    A clansman born, a kinsman true;
    Each word against his honor spoke,
    Demands of me avenging stroke;
    Yet more, upon thy fate, 'tis said,
    A mighty augury[274] is laid.It rests with me to wind my horn,--
    Thou art with numbers overborne;
    It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
    Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand:
    But, not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
    Will I depart from honor's laws;
    To assail a wearied man were shame,
    And stranger is a holy name;
    Guidance and rest, and food and fire,
    In vain he never must require.Then rest thee here till dawn of day;
    Myself will guide thee on the way,
    O'er stock and stone, through watch and ward,
    Till past Clan-Alpine's utmost guard,
    As far as Coilantogle's ford;
    From thence thy warrant[275] is thy sword."--
    "I take thy courtesy, by Heaven,
    As freely as 'tis nobly given!"--
    "Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry
    Sings us the lake's wild lullaby."With that he shook the gather'd heath,
    And spread his plaid upon the wreath;
    And the brave foemen, side by side,
    Lay peaceful down, like brothers tried,
    And slept until the dawning beam
    Purpled the mountain and the stream.I.

    Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
        When first, by the bewilder'd pilgrim spied,
    It smiles upon the dreary brow of night,
        And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide,
    And lights the fearful path on mountain side;--
      Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
    Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
      Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star,
    Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.That early beam, so fair and sheen,
    Was twinkling through the hazel screen,
    When, rousing at its glimmer red,
    The warriors left their lowly bed,
    Look'd out upon the dappled sky,
    Mutter'd their soldier matins by,
    And then awaked their fire, to steal,[276]
    As short and rude, their soldier meal.That o'er, the Gael around him threw
    His graceful plaid of varied hue,
    And, true to promise, led the way,
    By thicket green and mountain gray.A wildering path!--they winded now
    Along the precipice's brow,
    Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
    The windings of the Forth and Teith,
    And all the vales beneath that lie,
    Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
    Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
    Gain'd not the length of horseman's lance
    'Twas oft so steep, the foot was fain
    Assistance from the hand to gain;
    So tangled oft, that, bursting through,
    Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
    That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
    It rivals all but Beauty's tear!At length they came where, stern and steep,
    The hill sinks down upon the deep.Here Vennachar in silver flows,
    There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
    Ever the hollow path twined on,
    Beneath steep bank and threatening stone;
    An hundred men might hold the post
    With hardihood against a host.The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
    Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak,
    With shingles[277] bare, and cliffs between,
    And patches bright of bracken green,
    And heather black, that waved so high,
    It held the copse in rivalry.But where the lake slept deep and still,
    Dank[278] osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
    And oft both path and hill were torn,
    Where wintry torrent down had borne,
    And heap'd upon the cumber'd land
    Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.So toilsome was the road to trace,
    The guide, abating of his pace,
    Led slowly through the pass's jaws,
    And ask'd Fitz-James, by what strange cause
    He sought these wilds, traversed by few,
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."Brave Gael, my pass in danger tried,
    Hangs in my belt, and by my side;
    Yet, sooth to tell," the Saxon said,
    "I dreamt not now to claim its aid.When here, but three days since, I came,
    Bewilder'd in pursuit of game,
    All seem'd as peaceful and as still
    As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
    Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
    Nor soon expected back from war.Thus said, at least, my mountain guide,
    Though deep, perchance, the villain lied."--
    "Yet why a second venture try?"--
    "A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
    Moves our free course by such fix'd cause
    As gives the poor mechanic laws?Enough, I sought to drive away
    The lazy hours of peaceful day;
    Slight cause will then suffice to guide
    A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
    A falcon flown, a greyhound stray'd,
    The merry glance of mountain maid:
    Or, if a path be dangerous known,
    The danger's self is lure alone.""Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
    Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
    Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
    Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?"--"No, by my word;--of bands prepared
    To guard King James's sports I heard;
    Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
    This muster of the mountaineer,
    Their pennons will abroad be flung,
    Which else in Doune had peaceful hung."--
    "Free be they flung!--for we were loth
    Their silken folds should feast the moth.Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
    Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.But, Stranger, peaceful since you came,
    Bewilder'd in the mountain game,
    Whence the bold boast by which you show[279]
    Vich-Alpine's vow'd and mortal foe?"--
    "Warrior, but yester-morn, I knew
    Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Save as an outlaw'd desperate man,
    The chief of a rebellious clan,
    Who, in the Regent's[280] court and sight,
    With ruffian dagger stabb'd a knight:
    Yet this alone might from his part
    Sever each true and loyal heart."[280] Duke of Albany (see Introduction, p.Wrothful at such arraignment foul,
    Dark lower'd the clansman's sable scowl.A space he paused, then sternly said,
    "And heardst thou why he drew his blade?Heardst thou, that shameful word and blow
    Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?What reck'd the Chieftain if he stood
    On Highland heath, or Holy-Rood?He rights such wrong where it is given,
    If it were in the court of heaven."--
    "Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
    Not then claim'd sovereignty his due;
    While Albany, with feeble hand,
    Held borrow'd truncheon of command,
    The young King, mew'd[281] in Stirling tower,
    Was stranger to respect and power.[282]
    But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
    Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
    Wrenching from ruin'd Lowland swain
    His herds and harvest rear'd in vain.--
    Methinks a soul, like thine, should scorn
    The spoils from such foul foray borne."[282] That period of Scottish history from the battle of Flodden to the
majority of James V. was full of disorder and violence.The Gael beheld him grim the while,
    And answer'd with disdainful smile,--
    "Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
    I mark'd thee send delighted eye,
    Far to the south and east, where lay,
    Extended in succession gay,
    Deep waving fields and pastures green,
    With gentle <DW72>s and groves between:--
    These fertile plains, that soften'd vale,
    Were once the birthright of the Gael;
    The stranger came with iron hand,
    And from our fathers reft[283] the land.See, rudely swell
    Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.Ask we this savage hill we tread,
    For fatten'd steer or household bread;
    Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,--
    And well the mountain might reply,
    'To you, as to your sires of yore,
    Belong the target and claymore!I give you shelter in my breast,
    Your own good blades must win the rest.'Pent in this fortress of the north,
    Thinkst thou we will not sally forth,
    To spoil the spoiler as we may,
    And from the robber rend the prey?Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
    The Saxon rears one shock of grain;
    While, of ten thousand herds, there strays
    But one along yon river's maze,--
    The Gael, of plain and river heir,
    Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share.Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold,
    That plundering Lowland field and fold
    Is aught but retribution true?Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu."Answer'd Fitz-James,--"And, if I sought,
    Thinkst thou no other could be brought?What deem ye of my path waylaid?My life given o'er to ambuscade?"--
    "As of a meed to rashness due:
    Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
    I seek my hound, or falcon stray'd,
    I seek, good faith,[284] a Highland maid,--
    Free hadst thou been to come and go;
    But secret path marks secret foe.Nor yet, for this, even as a spy,
    Hadst thou, unheard, been doom'd to die,
    Save to fulfill an augury."--
    "Well, let it pass; nor will I now
    Fresh cause of enmity avow,
    To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.Enough, I am by promise tied
    To match me with this man of pride:
    Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
    In peace; but when I come agen,
    I come with banner, brand, and bow,
    As leader seeks his mortal foe.For lovelorn swain, in lady's bower,
    Ne'er panted for the appointed hour,
    As I, until before me stand
    This rebel Chieftain and his band!"--

[284] "Good faith," i.e., in good faith.--He whistled shrill,
    And he was answer'd from the hill;
    Wild as the scream of the curlew,
    From crag to crag the signal flew.Instant, through copse and heath, arose
    Bonnets and spears and bended bows;
    On right, on left, above, below,
    Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
    From shingles gray their lances start,
    The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
    The rushes and the willow wand
    Are bristling into ax and brand,
    And every tuft of broom gives life
    To plaided warrior arm'd for strife.That whistle garrison'd the glen
    At once with full five hundred men,
    As if the yawning hill to heaven
    A subterranean host had given.Watching their leader's beck and will,
    All silent there they stood, and still.Like the loose crags, whose threatening mass
    Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
    As if an infant's touch could urge
    Their headlong passage down the verge,
    With step and weapon forward flung,
    Upon the mountain side they hung.The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
    Along Benledi's living side,
    Then fix'd his eye and sable brow
    Full on Fitz-James--"How say'st thou now?These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
    And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!"X.

    Fitz-James was brave:--Though to his heart
    The lifeblood thrill'd with sudden start,
    He mann'd himself with dauntless air,
    Return'd the Chief his haughty stare,
    His back against a rock he bore,
    And firmly placed his foot before:--
    "Come one, come all!this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I."Sir Roderick mark'd--and in his eyes
    Respect was mingled with surprise,
    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
    Down sunk the disappearing band;
    Each warrior vanish'd where he stood,
    In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
    Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
    In osiers pale and copses low;
    It seem'd as if their mother Earth
    Had swallowed up her warlike birth.The wind's last breath had toss'd in air
    Pennon, and plaid, and plumage fair,--
    The next but swept a lone hillside,
    Where heath and fern were waving wide:
    The sun's last glance was glinted[285] back,
    From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
    The next, all unreflected, shone
    On bracken green, and cold gray stone.Fitz-James look'd round--yet scarce believed
    The witness that his sight received;
    Such apparition well might seem
    Delusion of a dreadful dream.Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
    And to his look the Chief replied,
    "Fear naught--nay, that I need not say--
    But--doubt not aught from mine array.Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
    As far as Coilantogle ford:
    Nor would I call a clansman's brand
    For aid against one valiant hand,
    Though on our strife lay every vale
    Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.So move we on;--I only meant
    To show the reed on which you leant,
    Deeming this path you might pursue
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."They mov'd:--I said Fitz-James was brave,
    As ever knight that belted glaive;
    Yet dare not say, that now his blood
    Kept on its wont and temper'd flood,[286]
    As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
    That seeming lonesome pathway through,
    Which yet, by fearful proof, was rife
    With lances, that, to take his life,
    Waited but signal from a guide
    So late dishonor'd and defied.Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
    The vanish'd guardians of the ground,
    And still, from copse and heather deep,
    Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
    And in the plover's shrilly strain,
    The signal-whistle heard again.Nor breathed he free till far behind
    The pass was left; for then they wind
    Along a wide and level green,
    Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
    Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
    To hide a bonnet or a spear.The Chief in silence strode before,
    And reach'd that torrent's sounding shore,
    Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,[287]
    From Vennachar in silver breaks,
    Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
    On Bochastle the moldering lines,
    Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
    Of yore her eagle[288] wings unfurl'd.And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
    Threw down his target and his plaid,
    And to the Lowland warrior said,--
    "Bold Saxon!to his promise just,
    Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
    This head of a rebellious clan,
    Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
    Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
    A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.See here, all vantageless[289] I stand,
    Arm'd, like thyself, with single brand:
    For this is Coilantogle ford,
    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."[287] Katrine, Achray, and Vennachar.[288] The eagle, with wings displayed and a thunderbolt in one of its
talons, was the ensign of the Roman legions.Ancient earthworks near
Bochastle are thought to date back to the Roman occupation of Britain.The Saxon paused:--"I ne'er delay'd
    When foeman bade me draw my blade;
    Nay, more, brave Chief, I vow'd thy death:
    Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
    And my deep debt for life preserv'd,
    A better meed have well deserv'd:
    Can naught but blood our feud atone?And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
    The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
    For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred
    Between the living and the dead:
    'Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
    His party conquers in the strife.'"--
    "Then, by my word," the Saxon said,
    "The riddle is already read.Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
    There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy,
    Then yield to Fate, and not to me.To James, at Stirling, let us go,
    When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
    Or if the King shall not agree
    To grant thee grace and favor free,[290]
    I plight mine honor, oath, and word,
    That, to thy native strengths[291] restored,
    With each advantage shalt thou stand,
    That aids thee now to guard thy land."Dark lightning flash'd from Roderick's eye--
    "Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
    Because a wretched kern ye slew,
    Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!Thou add'st but fuel to my hate:--
    My clansman's blood demands revenge.Not yet prepared?--By Heaven, I change
    My thought, and hold thy valor light
    As that of some vain carpet knight,
    Who ill deserved my courteous care,
    And whose best boast is but to wear
    A braid of his fair lady's hair."--
    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
    For I have sworn this braid to stain
    In the best blood that warms thy vein.and, ruth, begone!--
    Yet think not that by thee alone,
    Proud Chief!can courtesy be shown;
    Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
    Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
    Of this small horn one feeble blast
    Would fearful odds against thee cast.But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
    We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."--
    Then each at once his falchion drew,
    Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
    Each look'd to sun, and stream, and plain,
    As what they ne'er might see again;
    Then foot, and point, and eye opposed,
    In dubious strife they darkly closed.Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
    That on the field his targe he threw,
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull hide
    Had death so often dash'd aside;
    For, train'd abroad[292] his arms to wield,
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.He practiced every pass and ward,
    To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
    While less expert, though stronger far,
    The Gael maintain'd unequal war.Three times in closing strife they stood,
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;
    And, as firm rock, or castle roof,
    Against the winter shower is proof,
    The foe, invulnerable still,
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
    And backward borne upon the lea,
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee."Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
    The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!"--
    "Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!Let recreant yield, who fears to die."--Like adder darting from his coil,
    Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
    Like mountain cat who guards her young,
    Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
    Received, but reck'd not of a wound,
    And lock'd his arms his foeman round.--
    Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
    Through bars of brass and triple steel!--
    They tug, they strain!down, down they go,
    The Gael above, Fitz-James below.The Chieftain's gripe his throat compress'd,
    His knee was planted in his breast;
    His clotted locks he backward threw,
    Across his brow his hand he drew,
    From blood and mist to clear his sight,
    Then gleam'd aloft his dagger bright!--
    --But hate and fury ill supplied
    The stream of life's exhausted tide,
    And all too late the advantage came,
    To turn the odds of deadly game;
    For, while the dagger gleam'd on high,
    Reel'd soul and sense, reel'd brain and eye.but in the heath
    The erring blade found bloodless sheath.The struggling foe may now unclasp
    The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
    Unwounded from the dreadful close,
    But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.He falter'd thanks to Heaven for life,
    Redeem'd, unhoped, from desperate strife;
    Next on his foe his look he cast,
    Whose every gasp appear'd his last;
    In Roderick's gore he dipt the braid,--
    "Poor Blanche!thy wrongs are dearly paid:
    Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
    The praise that Faith and Valor give."With that he blew a bugle note,
    Undid the collar from his throat,
    Unbonneted, and by the wave
    Sate down his brow and hands to lave.Then faint afar are heard the feet
    Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
    The sounds increase, and now are seen
    Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
    Two who bear lance, and two who lead,
    By loosen'd rein, a saddled steed;
    Each onward held his headlong course,
    And by Fitz-James rein'd up his horse,--
    With wonder view'd the bloody spot--
    "Exclaim not, gallants!question not.--
    You, Herbert and Luffness, alight,
    And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
    Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
    We destined for a fairer freight,
    And bring him on to Stirling straight;
    I will before at better speed,
    To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.The sun rides high;--I must be boune,
    To see the archer game at noon;
    But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
    De Vaux and Herries, follow me."--the steed obey'd,
    With arching neck and bended head,
    And glancing eye and quivering ear,
    As if he loved his lord to hear.No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
    No grasp upon the saddle laid,
    But wreath'd his left hand in the mane,
    And lightly bounded from the plain,
    Turn'd on the horse his armed heel,
    And stirr'd his courage with the steel.[293]
    Bounded the fiery steed in air,
    The rider sate erect and fair,
    Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
    Forth launch'd, along the plain they go.They dash'd that rapid torrent through,
    And up Carhonie's[294] hill they flew;
    Still at the gallop prick'd[295] the Knight,
    His merry-men follow'd as they might.they ride,
    And in the race they mock thy tide;
    Torry and Lendrick now are past,
    And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
    They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune,
    They sink in distant woodland soon;
    Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
    They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
    They mark just glance and disappear
    The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
    They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides,
    Dark Forth!amid thy sluggish tides,
    And on the opposing shore take ground,
    With plash, with scramble, and with bound.Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!And soon the bulwark of the North,
    Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
    Upon their fleet career look'd down.[294] About a mile from the mouth of Lake Vennachar.As up the flinty path they strain'd,
    Sudden his steed the leader rein'd;
    A signal to his squire he flung,
    Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
    "Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
    Who townward holds the rocky way,
    Of stature tall and poor array?Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
    With which he scales the mountain side?Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?"--
    "No, by my word;--a burly groom
    He seems, who in the field or chase
    A baron's train would nobly grace."--
    "Out, out, De Vaux!can fear supply,
    And jealousy, no sharper eye?Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
    That stately form and step I knew;
    Like form in Scotland is not seen,
    Treads not such step on Scottish green.'Tis James of Douglas, by St.Away, away, to court, to show
    The near approach of dreaded foe:
    The King must stand upon his guard;
    Douglas and he must meet prepared."Then right-hand wheel'd their steeds, and straight
    They won the Castle's postern gate.The Douglas, who had bent his way
    From Cambus-kenneth's Abbey gray,
    Now, as he climb'd the rocky shelf,
    Held sad communion with himself:--
    "Yes!all is true my fears could frame;
    A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
    And fiery Roderick soon will feel
    The vengeance of the royal steel.I, only I, can ward their fate,--
    God grant the ransom come not late!The Abbess hath her promise given,
    My child shall be the bride of Heaven;[296]--

    And play my prize;--King James shall mark,

    Whose force so oft, in happier days,
    His boyish wonder loved to praise."[296] "Bride of Heaven," i.e., a nun.[297] William, eighth earl of Douglas, was stabbed by James II.while
