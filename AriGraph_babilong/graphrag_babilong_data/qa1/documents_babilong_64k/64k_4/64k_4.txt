Avicia's father,
learning that I had recovered a portion of Silvain's inheritance,
demanded from me an account of it, and asserted his rights as the
natural guardian of his grandchildren.There was no gainsaying the
demand, and I was compelled reluctantly to leave Eric and Emilius in
his charge.I succeeded, however, in prevailing upon him to allow them
to pay me regular visits of long duration, so that a close intimacy of
affectionate friendship has been established between them and the
members of my family.Here ends my story--a strange and eventful one,
you will admit.I often think of it in wonder, and this is the first
time a full recital of it has passed my lips."Such a story, which Doctor Louis truly described as strange and
eventful, could not have failed to leave a deep impression upon me.During its recital I had, as it were, been charmed out of myself.My
instinctive distrust of the twin brothers Eric and Emilius, the growth
of a groundless jealousy, was for a while forgotten, and at the
conclusion of the recital I was lost in the contemplation of the
tragic pictures which had been presented to my mind's eye.Singularly
enough, the most startling bit of colour in these pictures, that of
the two brothers in their life and death struggle on the outer walls
of the lighthouse, was not to me the dominant feature of the
remarkable story.The awful, unnatural contest, Avicias agony,
Silvain's soul-moving appeals, and the dread silence of Kristel--all
this was as nought in comparison with the figure of a solitary man
standing on the seashore, gazing in the direction of his lost
happiness.I traced his life back through the years during which he
was engaged in his relentless pursuit of the brother who had brought
desolation into his life.In him, and in him alone, was centred the
true pathos of the story; it was he who had been robbed, it was he who
had been wronged.No deliberate act of treachery lay at his door; he
loved, and had been deceived.Those in whom he placed his trust had
deliberately betrayed him.The vengeance he sought and consummated was
just.I did not make Doctor Louis acquainted with my views on the subject,
knowing that he would not agree with me, and that all his sympathies
were bestowed upon Silvain.There was something of cowardice in this
concealment of my feelings, but although I experienced twinges of
conscience for my want of courage, it was not difficult for me to
justify myself in my own eyes.Doctor Louis was the father of the
woman I loved, and in his hands lay my happiness.On no account must I
instil doubt into his mind; he was a man of decided opinions,
dogmatic, and strong-willed.No act or word of mine must cause him to
have the least distrust of me.Therefore I played the cunning part,
and was silent with respect to those threads in the story which
possessed the firmest hold upon his affections.This enforced silence accentuated and strengthened my view.Silvain
and Avicia were weak, feeble creatures.The man of great heart and
resolute will, the man whose sufferings and wrongs made him a martyr,
was Kristel.Trustful, heroic,
unflinching.But he and his brother, and the woman
who had been the instrument of their fate, belonged to the past.They
were dead and gone, and in the presence of Doctor Louis I put them
aside a while.Time enough to think of them when I was alone.They lived, and between their
lives and mine there was a link.Of this I entertained no doubt, nor
did I doubt that, in this connection, the future would not be
colourless for us.To be prepared for the course which events might
take: this was now my task and my duty."As Kristel acted, so would I act, in love and hate."I observed Doctor Louis's eyes fixed earnestly upon my face."Is not such a story," I said evasively, "enough to agitate one?Its
movements are as the movements of a sublime tragedy.""True," mused Doctor Louis; "even in obscure lives may be found such
elements.""You have told me little," I said, "of Eric and Emilius.Do they
reside permanently in the lighthouse in which their mother died?""They have a house in the village by the sea," replied Doctor Louis,
"and they are in a certain sense fishermen on a large scale.The place
has possessed for them a fascination, and it seemed as if they would
never be able to tear themselves away from it.But their intimate
association with it will soon be at an end.""They have sold their house and boats, and are coming to reside in
Nerac for a time."I started and turned aside, for I did not wish Doctor Louis to see the
cloud upon my face."It depends upon circumstances," said Doctor Louis."If they are happy
and contented in the present and in their prospects in the future,
they will remain.We have talked of it
often, and I have urged them not to waste their lives in a village so
small and primitive as that in which they were born.""Somewhat destructive of your own theories of happiness, doctor," I
observed."Yourself, for instance, wasting your life in a small place
like Nerac, when by your gifts you are so well fitted to play your
part in a large city.""I am selfish, I am afraid," he said with a deprecatory smile, "and am
too much wrapped up in my own ease and comfort.At the same time you
must bear in mind that mine is an exceptional case.It is a regretful
thing to be compelled to say that the majority of lives and homes are
less happy than my own.Often there is love, and poverty stands at the
bright door which opens but on a scene of privation and ill-requited
toil.Often there is wealth, in the use of which there has been an
endeavour to purchase love, which, my friend, is not a marketable
commodity.Often there are sorrow and sickness, and neither faith nor
patience to lighten the load.It is my good fortune to have none of
these ills.We have love and good health, and a sufficient share of
worldly prosperity to provide for our days.Therefore I will leave
myself out of the question.he cried, interrupting himself in a
tone at once light and earnest; "am I entirely useless in Nerac?"You do much," I said, "and also do Eric and Emilius in their village.You have admitted that they are fishermen on a large scale, and
possess boats.Consequently they employ labour, and the wages they pay
support the homes of those who serve them.""With some young men," said Doctor Louis, with a good-humoured laugh,
"there is no arguing.They are so keen in defence that they have a
formidable parry for every thrust.To the point, then, without
argument.Eric and Emilius have in them certain qualities which render
me doubtful whether, as middle-aged men, they would be in their proper
sphere in their village by the sea.The maidens there find no serious
favour in their eyes.""Do they look," I asked, with a torturing pang of jealousy, "with a
more appreciative eye upon the maidens in Nerac?""Tush, tush," said Doctor Louis, in a kind tone, laying his hand upon
my shoulder; "vex not yourself unnecessarily.Youth's hot blood is a
torrent, restless by day and night, never satisfied, never content,
for ever seeking cause to fret and fume.You have given evidence of
wisdom, Gabriel--exercise it when it is most needed."Of all the maidens in Nerac," I said, striving to speak with
calmness, "Lauretta is the fairest and sweetest."I, her father, will not gainsay you.""Is it because she is fairer and sweeter than any Eric and Emilius
have seen in the village by the sea that they quit their home there,
and come to live in Nerac?"Were I simply an ordinary friend of yours, and not
Lauretta's father, I might feel inclined to play with you; but as
it is, my happiness here is too largely at stake.Viewing with a selfish eye--a human failing, common
enough--your own immediate affairs, forget not that I, Lauretta's
father, am as deeply concerned in them as yourself.Never would I be
guilty of the crime of forcing my child's affections.Do you think I
love her less than you do?If it should be your happy fate to be a
father, you will learn how much purer and higher is the love of a
father than that which a young man, after an hour's acquaintance,
bears for the maiden whom he would wed.""It cannot be said to be more," responded Doctor Louis gravely,
"compared with my knowledge of my child."The retort was well-merited, and I murmured, "Forgive me!"The
consistently sweet accents of Doctor Louis's voice produced in me, at
this moment, a feeling of self-reproach, and a true sense of my
petulance and imperiousness forced itself upon me."There is little need to ask forgiveness," said Doctor Louis; "I can
make full allowance for the impetuous passions of youth, and if I wish
you to place a curb upon them it is for your welfare and that of my
child.Indulgence in such extravagances leads to injustice.Gabriel, I
will be entirely frank with you.Before your arrival in Nerac I had a
slight suspicion that one of the brothers--towards both of whom I feel
as a father--had an affection for Lauretta which might have ripened
into love.It is in the nature of things that a beautiful girl should
inspire a sentiment in the breasts of more than one man, but she can
belong only to one, to him to whom her heart is drawn.What passed
between us when you spoke to me as a lover of my daughter was honest
and outspoken.The encouragement you received from me would have been
withheld had it not been that I saw you occupied a place in Lauretta's
heart, and that the one end and aim I have in view is her happiness.""Is it too much to ask," I said, "to which of the brothers you
referred?""Altogether too much," replied Doctor Louis."It is an unrevealed
secret, and the right is not mine to say more than I have said."I did not speak for a little while; I was the slave of conflicting
passions.One moment I believed entirely in Doctor Louis; another
moment I doubted him; and through all I was oppressed by a
consciousness that I was doing him an injustice."Nothing special, sir," was my
reply, "but in a general way.""Born under such singular circumstances, and of such a father as
Silvain, it would not be unnatural to suppose that they might inherit
some touch of his strangely sympathetic nature.""They have inherited it," said Doctor Louis; "there exists between
them a sympathy as strange as that which existed in Silvain.I am at
liberty to say nothing more."He spoke in a firm tone, and I did not question him further.As I
accompanied him home we conversed upon general subjects, and I took
pains to convey to him an assurance that there was nothing really
serious in the ungracious temper I had displayed.He was relieved at
this, and we fell into our old confidential manner with each other.I passed the evening, as usual, in the society of his wife and
Lauretta.Peace descended upon me, and in the sweet presence of these
pure women I was tranquil and happy.How lovely, how beautiful was
this home of love and tender thought!The wild storms of life died
away, and strains of soft, angelic music melted the heart, and made
themselves heard even in the midst of the silences.Doctor Louis's
gaiety returned to him; he smiled upon me, and indulged in many a
harmless jest.I was charmed out of my moody humour, and contributed
to the innocent enjoyment of the home circle.The hours passed till it
was near bed-time, and then it was that a change came over me.Sitting
by Lauretta's side, turning the pages of an illustrated book of
travel, I heard the names of Eric and Emilius spoken by Doctor Louis.He was telling his wife of the impending change in their mode of life,
and there was an affectionate note in his voice, and also in hers,
which jarred upon me.I started to my feet, and they all turned to me
in surprise.I recovered myself in a moment, and explained that I had
suddenly thought of something which rendered it necessary that I
should go at once to the house I had taken, and of which Martin Hartog
was at present the sole custodian."But you were not to leave us till the end of the week," expostulated
Lauretta's mother."Indeed it is," I replied, "and should have been attended to earlier."You need have no anxiety; everything is prepared, and I
shall be quite comfortable.""My wife is thinking of the sheets," observed Doctor Louis jocosely;
"whether they are properly aired.""I have seen to that," she said, "and there is a fire in every room.""Then we can safely let him go," rejoined Doctor Louis."He is old
enough to take care of himself, and, besides, he is now a householder,
and has duties.We shall see you to-morrow, Gabriel?""Yes, I shall be here in the morning."So I wished them good-night, and presently was out in the open,
walking through dark shadows.In solitude I reviewed with amazement the occurrences of the last few
moments.It seemed to me that I had been impelled to do what I had
done by an occult agency outside myself.Not that I did not approve of
it.It was in accordance with my intense wish and desire--which had
lain dormant in the sweet society of Lauretta--to be alone, in order
that I might, without interruption, think over the story I had heard
from Doctor Louis's lips.And now that this wish and desire were
gratified, the one figure which still rose vividly before me was the
figure of Kristel.As I walked onward I followed the hapless man
mentally in his just pursuit of the brother who had snatched the cup
of happiness from his lips.Yes, it was just and right, and what he
did I would have done under similar circumstances.Of all who had
taken part in the tragic drama he, and he alone, commanded my
sympathy.The distance from Doctor Louis's house to mine was under two miles,
but I prolonged it by a _detour_ which brought me, without
premeditation, to the inn known as the Three Black Crows.I had no
intention of going there or of entering the inn, and yet, finding
myself at the door, I pushed it open, and walked into the room in
which the customers took their wine.This room was furnished with
rough tables and benches, and I seated myself, and in response to the
landlord's inquiry, ordered a bottle of his best, and invited him to
share it with me.He, nothing loth, accepted the invitation, and sat
at the table, emptying his glass, which I continued to fill for him,
while my own remained untasted.I had been inside the Three Black
Crows on only one occasion, in the company of Doctor Louis, and the
landlord now expressed his gratitude for the honour I did him by
paying him another visit.It was only the sense of his words which
reached my ears, my attention being almost entirely drawn to two men
who were seated at a table at the end of the room, drinking bad wine
and whispering to each other.Observing my eyes upon them, the
landlord said in a low tone, "Strangers."Their backs were towards me, and I could not see their faces, but I
noticed that one was humpbacked, and that, to judge from their attire,
they were poor peasants."I asked them," said the landlord, "whether they wanted a bed, and
they answered no, that they were going further.If they had stopped
here the night I should have kept watch on them!""I don't like their looks, and my wife's a timorous creature.Then
there's the children--you've seen my little ones, I think, sir?"Surely those men would do them no harm!""Perhaps not, sir; but a man, loving those near to him, thinks of the
possibilities of things.I've got a bit of money in the house, to pay
my rent that's due to-morrow, and one or two other accounts."Do you think they have come to Nerac on a robbing expedition?"Roguery has a plain face, and the signs are in
theirs, or my name's not what it is.When they said they were going
further on I asked them where, and they said it was no business of
mine.They gave me the same answer when I asked them where they came
from.They're up to no good, that's certain, and the sooner they're
out of the village the better for all of us."The more the worthy landlord talked the more settled became his
instinctive conviction that the strangers were rogues."If robbery is their errand," I said thoughtfully, "there are houses
in Nerac which would yield them a better harvest than yours.""Of course there is," was his response.He
has generally some money about him, and his silver plate would be a
prize.Are you going back there to-night, sir?""No; I am on my road to my own house, and I came out of the way a
little for the sake of the walk.""That's my profit, sir," said the landlord cheerfully."I would offer
to keep you company if it were not that I don't like to leave my
place.""There's nothing to fear," I said; "if they molest me I shall be a
match for them.""Still," urged the landlord, "I should leave before they do.It's as
well to avoid a difficulty when we have the opportunity."I took the hint, and paid my score.To all appearance there was no
reason for alarm on my part; during the time the landlord and I were
conversing the strangers had not turned in our direction, and as we
spoke in low tones they could not have heard what we said.They
remained in the same position, with their backs towards us, now
drinking in silence, now speaking in whispers to each other.Outside the Three Black Crows I walked slowly on, but I had not gone
fifty yards before I stopped.What was in my mind was the reference
made by the landlord to Doctor Louis's house and to its being worth
the plundering.The doctor's house contained what was dearer to me
than life or fortune.Should I leave her at the
mercy of these scoundrels who might possibly have planned a robbery of
the doctor's money and plate?In that case Lauretta would be in
danger.I would return to the Three
Black Crows, and look through the window of the room in which I had
left the men, to ascertain whether they were still there.If they
were, I would wait for them till they left the inn, and then would set
a watch upon their movements.If they were gone I would hasten to the
doctor's house, to render assistance, should any be needed.I had no
weapon, with the exception of a small knife; could I not provide
myself with something more formidable?A few paces from where I stood
were some trees with stout branches.I detached one of these branches,
and with my small knife fashioned it into a weapon which would serve
my purpose.It was about four feet in length, thick at the striking
end and tapering towards the other, so that it could be held with ease
and used to good purpose.I tried it on the air, swinging it round and
bringing it down with sufficient force to kill a man, or with
certainty to knock the senses out of him in one blow.Then I returned
to the inn, and looked through the window.In the settlement of my
proceedings I had remembered there was a red blind over the window
which did not entirely cover it, and through the uncovered space I now
saw the strangers sitting at the table as I had left them.Taking care to make no noise I stepped away from the window, and took
up a position from which I could see the door of the inn, which was
closed.I myself was in complete darkness, and there was no moon to
betray me; all that was needed from me was caution.I watched fully half an hour before the door of the inn was opened.No
person had entered during my watch, the inhabitants of Nerac being
early folk for rest and work.The two strangers lingered for a moment
upon the threshold, peering out into the night; behind them was the
landlord, with a candle in his hand.I did not observe that any words
passed between them and the landlord; they stepped into the road, and
the door was closed upon them.Then came the sounds of locking and
bolting doors and windows.I saw the faces of the men as they stood upon the threshold; they were
evil-looking fellows enough, and their clothes were of the commonest.For two or three minutes they did not stir; there had been nothing in
their manner to arouse suspicion, and the fact of their lingering on
the roadway seemed to denote that they were uncertain of the route
they should take.That they raised their faces to the sky was not
against them; it was a natural seeking for light to guide them.To the left lay the little nest of buildings amongst which were Father
Daniel's chapel and modest house, and the more pretentious dwelling of
Doctor Louis; to the right were the woods, at the entrance of which my
own house was situated.The left,
and it was part evidence of a guilty design.The right, and it would
be part proof that the landlord's suspicions were baseless.They exchanged a few words which did not reach my ears.Then they
moved onwards to the left.I grasped my weapon, and crept after them.But they walked only a dozen steps, and paused.In my mind
was the thought, "Continue the route you have commenced, and you are
dead men.The direction of the village was the more tempting to men who
had no roof to shelter them, for the reason that in Father Daniel's
chapel--which, built on an eminence, overlooked the village--lights
were visible from the spot upon which I and they were standing.There
was the chance of a straw bed and charity's helping hand, never
withheld by the good priest from the poor and wretched.Sandra moved to the bedroom.On their right
was dense darkness; not a glimmer of light.Nevertheless, after the exchange of a few more words which, like the
others, were unheard by me, they seemed to resolve to seek the
gloomier way.They turned from the village, and facing me, walked past
me in the direction of the woods.I breathed more freely, and fell into a curious mental consideration
of the relief I experienced.Was it because, walking as they were from
the village in which Lauretta was sleeping, I was spared the taking of
these men's lives?It was because of the indication they afforded
me that Lauretta was not in peril.In her defence I could have
justified the taking of a hundred lives.No feeling of guilt would
have haunted me; there would have been not only no remorse but no pity
in my soul.The violation of the most sacred of human laws would be
justified where Lauretta was concerned.She was mine, to cherish, to
protect, to love--mine, inalienably.She belonged to no other man, and
none should step between her and me--neither he whose ruffianly design
threatened her with possible harm, nor he, in a higher and more
polished grade, who strove to win her affections and wrest them from
me.In an equal way both were equally my enemies, and I should be
justified in acting by them as Kristel had acted to Silvain.Ah, but he had left it too late.Not so would I. Let but the faintest
breath of certainty wait upon suspicion, and I would scotch it
effectually for once and all.Had Kristel possessed the strange power
in his hours of dreaming which Silvain possessed, he would not have
been robbed of the happiness which was his by right.He would have
been forewarned, and Avicia would have been his wife.In every step in
life he took there would have been the fragrance of flowers around
him, and a heavenly light.Did I, then, admit that there was any resemblance in the characters of
Avicia and Lauretta?No; one was a weed, the other a rose.Here low desire and cunning; there
angelic purity and goodness.But immeasurably beneath Lauretta as
Avicia was, Kristel's love for the girl would have made her radiant
and spotless.All this time I was stealthily following the strangers to the woods.The sound arrested them; they clutched each other in
fear.I stood motionless, and they stood without movement for many moments.Then they simultaneously emitted a deep-drawn sigh."It was the wind," said the man who had already spoken.I smiled in contempt; not a breath of wind was stirring; there was not
the flutter of a leaf, not the waving of the lightest branch.They resumed their course, and I crept after them noiselessly.They
entered the wood; the trees grew more thickly clustered."This will do," I heard one say; and upon the words they threw
themselves to the ground, and fell into slumber.I bent over them and was
satisfied.The landlord of the Three Black Crows was mistaken.I moved
softly away, and when I was at a safe distance from them I lit a match
and looked at my watch; it was twenty minutes to eleven, and before
the minute-hand had passed the hour I arrived at my house.The door
was fast, but I saw a light in the lower room of the gardener's
cottage, which I had given to Martin Hartog as a residence for him and
his daughter."Hartog is awake," I thought; "expecting me perhaps."I knocked at the door of the cottage, and received no answer; I
knocked again with the same result.The door had fastenings of lock and latch.I put my hand to the latch,
and finding that the key had not been turned in the lock, opened the
door and entered.The room, however, was not without an occupant.At the table sat a
young girl, the gardener's daughter, asleep.She lay back in her
chair, and the light shone upon her face.I had seen her when she was
awake, and knew that she was beautiful, but as I gazed now upon her
sleeping form I was surprised to discover that she was even fairer
than I had supposed.She had hair of dark brown, which curled most
gracefully about her brow and head; her face, in its repose, was sweet
to look upon; she was not dressed as the daughter of a labouring man,
but with a certain daintiness and taste which deepened my surprise;
there was lace at her sleeves and around her white neck.Had I not
known her station I should have taken her for a lady.She was young,
not more than eighteen or nineteen I judged, and life's springtime lay
sweetly upon her.There was a smile of wistful tenderness on her lips.Her left arm was extended over the table, and her hand rested upon the
portrait of a man, almost concealing the features.Her right hand,
which was on her lap, enfolded a letter, and that and the
portrait--which, without curious prying, I saw was not that of her
father--doubtless were the motive of a pleasant dream.I took in all this in a momentary glance, and quickly left the room,
closing the door behind me.Then I knocked loudly and roughly, and
heard the hurried movements of a sudden awaking.She came to the door
and cried softly, "Is that you, father?She opened the door, and fell back a step in confusion."I should have let your father know," I said, "that I intended to
sleep here to-night--but indeed it was a hasty decision."Oh, no, sir," she said.Father is away on
business; I expected him home earlier, and waiting for him I fell
asleep.The servants are not coming till to-morrow morning."She gave them to me, and asked if she could do anything for me.I
answered no, that there was nothing required.As I wished her
good-night a man's firm steps were heard, and Martin Hartog appeared.He cast swift glances at his daughter and me, and it struck me that
they were not devoid of suspicion.I explained matters, and he
appeared contented with my explanation; then bidding his daughter go
indoors he accompanied me to the house.There was a fire in my bedroom, almost burnt out, and the handiwork of
an affectionate and capable housewife was everywhere apparent.Martin
Hartog showed an inclination then and there to enter into particulars
of the work he had done in the grounds during my absence, but I told
him I was tired, and dismissed him.I listened to his retreating
footsteps, and when I heard the front door closed I blew out the
candle and sat before the dying embers in the grate.Darkness was best
suited to my mood, and I sat and mused upon the events of the last
forty-eight hours.Gradually my thoughts became fixed upon the figures
of the two strangers I had left sleeping in the woods, in connection
with the suspicion of their designs which the landlord had imparted to
me.So concentrated was my attention that I re-enacted all the
incidents of which they were the inspirers--the fashioning of the
branch into a weapon, the watch I had set upon them, their issuing
from the inn, the landlord standing behind with the candle in his
hand, their lingering in the road, the first steps they took towards
the village, their turning back, and my stealthy pursuit after
them--not the smallest detail was omitted.I do not remember
undressing and going to bed.Encompassed by silence and darkness I was
only spiritually awake.I was aroused at about eight o'clock in the morning by the arrival of
the servants of the household whom Lauretta's mother had engaged for
me, They comprised a housekeeper, who was to cook and generally
superintend, and two stout wenches to do the rougher work.In such a
village as Nerac these, in addition to Martin Hartog, constituted an
establishment of importance.They had been so well schooled by Lauretta's mother before commencing
the active duties of their service, that when I rose I found the
breakfast-table spread, and the housekeeper in attendance to receive
my orders.This augured well, and I experienced a feeling of
satisfaction at the prospect of the happy life before me.Lauretta would be not only a sweet and loving
companion, but the same order and regularity would reign in our home
as in the home of her childhood.I blessed the chance, if chance it
was, which had led me to Nerac, and as I paced the room and thought of
Lauretta, I said audibly, "Thank God!"Breakfast over, I strolled into the grounds, and made a careful
inspection of the work which Martin Hartog had performed.The
conspicuous conscientiousness of his labours added to my satisfaction,
and I gave expression to it.He received my approval in manly fashion,
and said he would be glad if I always spoke my mind, "as I always
speak mine," he added.It pleased me that he was not subservient; in
all conditions of life a man owes it to himself to maintain, within
proper bounds, a spirit of independence.While he was pointing out to
me this and that, and urging me to make any suggestions which occurred
to me, his daughter came up to us and said that a man wished to speak
to me.I asked who the man was, and she replied, "The landlord of the
Three Black Crows."Curious as to his purpose in making so early a
call, and settling it with myself that his errand was on business, in
connection, perhaps, with some wine he wished to dispose of, I told
the young woman to send him to me, and presently he appeared.There
was an expression of awkwardness, I thought, in his face as he stood
before me, cap in hand."Well, landlord," I said smiling; "you wish to see me?""Go on," I said, wondering somewhat at his hesitation."Can I speak to you alone, sir?"Hartog, I will see you again presently."Martin Hartog took the hint, and left us together."It's about those two men, sir, you saw in my place last night."I said, pondering, and then a light broke upon me,
and I thought it singular--as indeed it was--that no recollection,
either of the men or the incidents in association with them should
have occurred to me since my awaking."_You_ are quite safe, sir," said the landlord, "I am glad to find.""Quite safe, landlord; but why should you be so specially glad?""That's what brought me round so early this morning, for one thing; I
was afraid something _might_ have happened.""Kindly explain yourself," I said, not at all impatient, but amused
rather."Well, sir, they might have found out, somehow or other, that you were
sleeping in the house alone last night"--and here he broke off and
asked, "You _did_ sleep here alone last night?""Certainly I did, and a capital night's rest I had."As I was saying, if they had found out that
you were sleeping here alone, they might have taken it into their
heads to trouble you.""They might, landlord, but facts are stubborn things."I understand that now, sir, but I had my fears, and that's what
brought me round for one thing.""An expression you have used once before, landlord.I
infer there must be another thing in your mind.""As yet I have heard nothing but a number of very enigmatical
observations from you with respect to those men.Ah, yes, I remember;
you had your doubts of them when I visited you on my road home?""I had sir; I told you I didn't like the looks of them, and that I was
not easy in my mind about my own family, and the bit of money I had in
my place to pay my rent with, and one or two other accounts.""That is so; you are bringing the whole affair back to me.I saw the
men after I left the Three Black Crows.""To tell you would be to interrupt what you have come here to say."Well, sir, this is the way of it.I suspected them from the first,
and you will bear witness of it before the magistrate.They were
strangers in Nerac, but that is no reason why I should have refused to
sell them a bottle of red wine when they asked for it.It's my trade
to supply customers, and the wine was the worst I had, consequently
the cheapest.I had no right to ask their business, and if they chose
to answer me uncivilly, it was their affair.I wouldn't tell everybody
mine on the asking.They paid for the wine, and there was an end of
it.They called for another bottle, and when I brought it I did not
draw the cork till I had the money for it, and as they wouldn't pay
the price--not having it about 'em--the cork wasn't drawn, and the
bottle went back.I had trouble to get rid of them, but they stumbled
out at last, and I saw no more of them.Now, sir, you will remember
that when we were speaking of them Doctor Louis's house was mentioned
as a likely house for rogues to break into and rob.""The villains couldn't hear what we said, no more than we could hear
what they were whispering about.But they had laid their plans, and
tried to hatch them--worse luck for one, if not for both the
scoundrels; but the other will be caught and made to pay for it.What
they did between the time they left the Three Black Crows and the time
they made an attempt to break into Doctor Louis's is at present a
mystery.Don't be alarmed, sir; I see that my news has stirred you,
but they have only done harm to themselves.No one else is a bit the
worse for their roguery.Doctor Louis and his good wife and daughter
slept through the night undisturbed; nothing occurred to rouse or
alarm them.They got up as usual, the doctor being the first--he is
known as an early riser.As it happened, it was fortunate that he was
outside his house before his lady, for although we in Nerac have an
idea that she is as brave as she is good, a woman, after all, is only
a woman, and the sight of blood is what few of them can stand."But that I was assured that
Lauretta was safe and well, I should not have wasted a moment on the
landlord, eager as I was to learn what he had come to tell.My mind,
however, was quite at ease with respect to my dear girl, and the next
few minutes were not so precious that I could not spare them to hear
the landlord's strange story."That," he resumed, "is what the doctor saw when he went to the back
of his house.Blood on the ground--and what is more, what would have
given the ladies a greater shock, there before him was the body of a
man--dead.""That I can't for a certainty say, sir, because I haven't seen him as
yet.I'm telling the story second-hand, as it was told to me a while
ago by one who had come straight from the doctor's house.There was
the blood, and there the man; and from the description I should say it
was one of the men who were drinking in my place last night.It is not
ascertained at what time of the night he and his mate tried to break
into the doctor's house, but the attempt was made.They commenced to bore a hole in one of the shutters
at the back; the hole made, it would have been easy to enlargen it,
and so to draw the fastenings.However, they did not get so far as
that.They could scarcely have been at their scoundrelly work a minute
or two before it came to an end.""How and by whom were they interrupted, landlord?"It is not known, sir, and it's just at this point that the mystery
commences.There they are at their work, and likely to be successful.A dark night, and not a watchman in the village.Never a need for one,
sir.Plenty of time before them, and desperate men they.Only one man
in the house, the good doctor; all the others women, easily dealt
with.Robbery first--if interfered with, murder afterwards.They
wouldn't have stuck at it, not they!But there it was, sir, as God
willed.Not a minute at work, and something occurs.The man lies dead on the ground, with a gimlet in his hand, and
Doctor Louis, in full sunlight, stands looking down on the strange
sight.""The man lies dead on the ground," I said, repeating the landlord's
words; "but there were two.""No sign of the other, sir; he's a vanished body."He will be found," I said----

"It's to be hoped," interrupted the landlord."And then what you call a mystery will be solved.""It's beyond me, sir," said the landlord, with a puzzled air.These two scoundrels, would-be murderers, plan a
robbery, and proceed to execute it.They are ill-conditioned
creatures, no better than savages, swayed by their passions, in which
there is no show of reason.They quarrel, perhaps, about the share of
the spoil which each shall take, and are not wise enough to put aside
their quarrel till they are in possession of the booty.They continue
their dispute, and in such savages their brutal passions once roused,
swell and grow to a fitting climax of violence.Probably the disagreement commenced on their way to the house, and had
reached an angry point when one began to bore a hole in the shutter.The proof was in his hand--the
gimlet with which he was working.""Well conceived, sir," said the landlord, following with approval my
speculative explanation."This man's face," I continued, "would be turned toward the shutter,
his back to his comrade.Into this comrade's mind darts, like a
lightning flash, the idea of committing the robbery alone, and so
becoming the sole possessor of the treasure.""Good, sir, good," said the landlord, rubbing his hands.Out comes his knife, or perhaps he
has it ready in his hand, opened.""No; such men carry clasp-knives.They are safest, and never attract
notice.""You miss nothing, sir," said the landlord admiringly."What a
magistrate you would have made!""He plunges it into his fellow-scoundrel's back, who falls dead, with
the gimlet in his hand.The landlord nodded excitedly, and continued to rub his hands; then
suddenly stood quite still, with an incredulous expression on his
face."But the robbery is not committed," he exclaimed; "the house is not
broken into, and the scoundrel gets nothing for his pains."With superior wisdom I laid a patronising hand upon his shoulder."The deed done," I said, "the murderer, gazing upon his dead comrade,
is overcome with fear.He has been rash--he may be caught red-handed;
the execution of the robbery will take time.He is not familiar with
the habits of the village, and does not know it has no guardians of
the night.He has not only committed murder, he has robbed himself.Better
to have waited till they had possession of the treasure; but this kind
of logic always comes afterwards to ill-regulated minds.Under the
influence of his newly-born fears he recognises that every moment is
precious; he dare not linger; he dare not carry out the scheme.Shuddering, he flies from the spot, with rage and despair in his
heart.The landlord, who was profuse in the expressions of his admiration at
the light I had thrown upon the case, so far as it was known to us,
accompanied me to the house of Doctor Louis.It was natural that I
should find Lauretta and her mother in a state of agitation, and it
was sweet to me to learn that it was partly caused by their anxieties
for my safety.Doctor Louis was not at home, but had sent a messenger
to my house to inquire after me, and to give me some brief account of
the occurrences of the night.We did not meet this messenger on our
way to the doctor's; he must have taken a different route from ours."You did wrong to leave us last night," said Lauretta's mother
chidingly.I shook my head, and answered that it was but anticipating the date of
my removal by a few days, and that my presence in her house would not
have altered matters."Everything was right at home," I said.What inexpressible
sweetness there was in the word!"Martin Hartog showed me to my room,
and the servants you engaged came early this morning, and attended to
me as though they had known my ways and tastes for years.""A dreamless night," I replied; "but had I suspected what was going on
here, I should not have been able to rest.""I am glad you had no suspicion, Gabriel; you would have been in
danger.Dreadful as it all is, it is a comfort to know that the
misguided men do not belong to our village."Her merciful heart could find no harsher term than this to apply to
the monsters, and it pained her to hear me say, "One has met his
deserved fate; it is a pity the other has escaped."But I could not
keep back the words.Doctor Louis had left a message for me to follow him to the office of
the village magistrate, where the affair was being investigated, but
previous to going thither, I went to the back of the premises to make
an inspection.The village boasted of one constable, and he was now on
duty, in a state of stupefaction.His orders were to allow nothing to
be disturbed, but his bewilderment was such that it would have been
easy for an interested person to do as he pleased in the way of
alteration.A stupid lout, with as much intelligence as a vegetable.However, I saw at once that nothing had been disturbed.The shutter in
which a hole had been bored was closed; there were blood stains on the
stones, and I was surprised that they were so few; the gate by which
the villains had effected an entrance into the garden was open; I
observed some particles of sawdust on the window-ledge just below
where the hole had been bored.All that had been removed was the body
of the man who had been murdered by his comrade.I put two or three questions to the constable, and he managed to
answer in monosyllables, yes and no, at random."A valuable
assistant," I thought, "in unravelling a mysterious case!"And then I
reproached myself for the sneer.Happy was a village like Nerac in
which crime was so rare, and in which an official so stupid was
sufficient for the execution of the law.The first few stains of blood I noticed were close to the window, and
the stones thereabout had been disturbed, as though by the falling of
a heavy body."Was the man's body," I inquired of the constable, "lifted from this
spot?"He looked down vacantly and said, "Yes.""Sure," he said after a pause, but whether the word was spoken in
reply to my question, or as a question he put to himself, I could not
determine.From the open gate to the
window was a distance of forty-eight yards; I stepped exactly a yard,
and I counted my steps.The path from gate to window was shaped like
the letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on
either side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this
path the villains had made their way to the window; through this path
the murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their
operations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been
conducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude
that, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must
have known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the
plundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious
turns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must
have felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,
most likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at
the open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the
shrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there
some stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were
indisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human
hands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with
my own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood
on the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly
torn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about
him, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both
for support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands
as he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the
murderer.Between
the victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became
of the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord
of the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of
crime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as
sudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped
without the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,
were the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been
grievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to
bring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had
invented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of
four rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the
magistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not
at all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely
that they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father
Daniel.During his lifetime no such
crime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was
that the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his
horror of the deed, and his large heart overflowed with pity both for
the guilty man and the victim.he said, in a voice broken by tears.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I
have been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his
murderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, "All
men should pray that they may never be tempted."And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to
offer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing
theories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my
own ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night."In certain respects you may be right in your speculations," the
magistrate said; "but on one important point you are in error.""I have already discovered," I said, "that my theory is wrong, and not
in accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently."As to the weapon with which the murder was done," replied the
magistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a
larger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac."A club of some sort," said the magistrate, "with which the dead man
was suddenly attacked from behind.""No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer."There is no shadow of doubt that the
missing man is guilty.""There can be none," said the magistrate."And yet," urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, "to condemn a man
unheard is repugnant to justice.""There are circumstances," said the magistrate, "which point so surely
to guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the
way," he continued, addressing me, "did not the landlord of the Three
Black Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn
last night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a
conversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the
same room as yourselves?""If he did," I said, "he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw
the strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have
been proved to be well founded.""Then you will be able to identify the body, already," added the
magistrate, "identified by the landlord.Confirmatory evidence
strengthens a case.""I shall be able to identify it," I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of
the strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and
whom I had afterwards watched and followed."The man who has escaped," I observed, "was hump backed.""That tallies with the landlord's statement," said the magistrate."I have something to relate," I said, upon our return to the court,
"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn."I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account
of my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my
thoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect
the doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the
safety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over
his daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm."But you ran a great risk, Gabriel," he said affectionately."I did not consider that," I said.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the
undivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound."At what time," he asked, "do you say you left the rogues asleep in
the woods?""It was twenty minutes to eleven," I replied, "and at eleven o'clock I
reached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog
was absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,
and I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and
accompanied me to my bedroom.""Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends
in consequence of what had passed?"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to
me to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I
was satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom
that I have enjoyed a better night."May not their slumbers have been feigned?"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.No,
I could not have been mistaken.""It is strange," mused Doctor Louis, "how guilt can sleep, and can
forget the present and the future!"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the
path from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,
from the position in which the body was found, that there had been no
struggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had
materially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed
also that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that
a struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his
assistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the
grounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the
evidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions."There are so many things to be considered," said Doctor Louis, "in a
case like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon
circumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not
be lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight
than those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite
patience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.You
believe, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?""Such is now my belief," I replied."Such signs as you have brought before our notice," continued the
doctor, "are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have
met with severe treatment?""Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?""Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable
disarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even
pavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the
utmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron
heels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and
all the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose
stones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without
conspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is
composed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear
evidence."Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel
as I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you
suppose these men to have been engaged?"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and
reluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my
observation."That is partially destructive of your theory," pursued the doctor."There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty
to say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept
more soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it
is really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I
think, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am
affected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant
weeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for
a long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence
upon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of
you."(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly
benignant smile.)"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the
dripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of
a cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,
unusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by
the boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must
have used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any
circumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have
aroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to
ascertain the cause."Then," said the magistrate, "how do you account for the injuries the
man who escaped must have undoubtedly received?"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There
was a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was
pushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one
whose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so
weak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I
recognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the
Three Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they
wandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing
steadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head
drooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran
through him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very
short time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be
obtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,
and although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was
in itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to
say in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not
a word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,
instructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a
strict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful
examination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise
his eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he
could not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and
each time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a
shudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the
room in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my
mind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the
conclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in
his right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his
crime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the
magistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of
pretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a
search for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for
none had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of
the ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in
guilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said
he had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour
or so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I
departed alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again
propounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which
he listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been
before that a struggle had taken place."But," he said, "whether a struggle for life did or did not take place
there is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always
viewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in
this instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,
to mete out to him the punishment for his crime."Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to
communicate to us."I have had," he said, "another interview with the prisoner, and have
succeeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,
and again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I
moved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to
loosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if
I was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the
fear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely
bound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He
repeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that
his question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses
to convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange
voice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of
men and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled
inwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a
prisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs
of levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to
me that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,
in order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had
committed.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the
question.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and
if you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in
this cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the
proof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was
listening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the
question,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me
to this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you
guilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did
not kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is
murdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have
killed me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him
in thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was
imposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I
said, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are
more powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is
why I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will
prove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in
which,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,
when you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in
self-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'
he said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel
perhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You
say,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if
you had not fled from him.''But,' I
said, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have
been your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon
you have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as
you say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered
at this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said
presently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I
played him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that
there should be in the world men with such a low order of
intelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.Demons glide noiselessly
along.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted
doggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get
nothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his
ridiculous defence, I left him.""Do you think," asked Doctor Louis, "that he has any, even the
remotest belief in the story?"I cannot believe it," replied the magistrate, "and yet I confess to
being slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which
might be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant
of the cunning of criminals.""Which means," said Doctor Louis, "that it is really not impossible
that the man's mind is diseased.""No," said the magistrate, in a positive tone, "I cannot for a moment
admit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a
stick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it
seemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been
no attempt at concealment."Here is the weapon," I cried, "with which the deed was done!"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it."Here," I said, pointing downwards, "is the direct line of flight
taken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror
as he ran.""It is an improvised weapon," said the magistrate, "cut but lately
from a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with
effect."I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its
resemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during
the watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and
said that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had
shaped with my knife."Do you remember," asked the magistrate, "what you did with it after
your suspicions were allayed?""No," I replied, "I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with
it.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it
this morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my
mind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it
aside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set
out to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,
and, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.""It is the only solution," said the magistrate."So that," I said with a sudden thrill of horror, "I am indirectly
responsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been
responsible had they used the weapon against those I love!"We have all happily been spared,
Gabriel," he said."It is only the guilty who have suffered."We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any
further evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,
and was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous
schemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this
evening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and
once, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done
unconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied
that he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had
entered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not
possible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing
as mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been
contrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning
Lauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a
feeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview
with the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended
belief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to
have some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure
which had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the
permission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further
admissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the
man persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his
own defence."I saw him this morning," the magistrate said, "and interrogated him
with severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be
innocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.""Have you asked him," I inquired, "to give you an account of all that
transpired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until
the moment he was arrested?""No," said the magistrate, "it did not occur to me to demand of him so
close a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should
have been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and
his invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is
conscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again
on minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature
warns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the
lowest order of criminals."My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial
account of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would
have extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed
where the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was
still bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than
before, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled
terror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and
lowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice
before he answered me."Why did you not reply to me at once?"But to this question, although
I repeated it also twice, he made no response."It is useless," I said sternly, "to attempt evasion with me, or to
think that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain
a confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it
from you, if you do not give it willingly."I understand you," he said, keeping his face averted from me, "but I
will not speak.""Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because
you have a design against me."His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my
intention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden
in his mind, and I was resolved to get at it."What design can I have against you," I said, "of which you need be
afraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for
you.Soon you
will be as dead as the man you murdered.""I did not murder him," was the strange reply, "and you know it.""You are playing the same trick upon me that you
played upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as
unsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you
than the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?"My body is, perhaps," he muttered, "but not my soul.""Oh," I said, in a tone of contempt, "you believe in a soul.""Yes," he replied, "do not you?"Not out of my fears, but out
of my hopes.""I have no hopes and no fears," he said."I have done wrong, but not
the wrong with which I am charged."His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to
make an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance."When I next command you," I said, "you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than
the pass to which you have brought it by your crime."And still he doggedly repeated, "I have committed no crime.""Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced
him to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His
eyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my
compelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the
weaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became
dimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we
remained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke."Relate to me," I said, "all that you know from the time you and the
man who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the
present moment."We were poor, both of us," Pierre commenced, "and had been poor all
our lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain
meat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had
been in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when
we were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;
starvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,
and so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing
else was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;
why should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some
sixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come
here and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a
rich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We
had no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a
slice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the
money he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us
to Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a
knock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to
them; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on
our way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the
straightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When
we entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money
left to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat
drinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with
the landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place
where we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were
talking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach
my ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We
wanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it
to us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were
bare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out
Doctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there
would be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past
midnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the
direction of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have
continued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,
I had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but
the idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I
determined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which
we had passed through before we reached the village, and there to
sleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into
execution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I
don't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember
hearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard
it too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and
heard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on
till we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we
threw ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I
pretended to be.I did not move;
I even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it
departed, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired
with the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us
which would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the
night I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I
woke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the
way.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses
had been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he
laughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked
round the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The
front of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we
made our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a
hole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our
being heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough
to enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We
did not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our
safety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be
shed.Our plan was to gag and tie
up any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;
we were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain
true to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked
away at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,
from the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not
move; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when
I heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club
was making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a
minute, and I turned and saw the demon.I
slanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,
fell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,
on my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,
tearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and
again, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,
till flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,
there was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than
the demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking
me so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag
myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.Sandra went back to the garden.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

    when he was quizzed about the gorilla?"Page 58:

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there."Conachar is no more,
unless in regard to the wrongs he has sustained, and the vengeance
which they demand.I am Ian Eachin MacIan, son to the chief of the Clan
Quhele.I have moulted my feathers, as you see, when I changed my name.And for these men, they are not my father's followers, but mine.You
see only one half of them collected: they form a band consisting of my
foster father and eight sons, who are my bodyguard, and the children of
my belt, who breathe but to do my will.But Conachar," he added, in a
softer tone of voice, "lives again so soon as Catharine desires to see
him; and while he is the young chief of the Clan Quhele to all others,
he is to her as humble and obedient as when he was Simon Glover's
apprentice.See, here is the stick I had from you when we nutted
together in the sunny braes of Lednoch, when autumn was young in the
year that is gone.I would not exchange it, Catharine, for the truncheon
of my tribe."While Eachin thus spoke, Catharine began to doubt in her own mind
whether she had acted prudently in requesting the assistance of a bold
young man, elated, doubtless, by his sudden elevation from a state of
servitude to one which she was aware gave him extensive authority over a
very lawless body of adherents."You do not fear me, fair Catharine?"said the young chief, taking her
hand."I suffered my people to appear before you for a few minutes,
that I might see how you could endure their presence; and methinks you
regarded them as if you were born to be a chieftain's wife.""I have no reason to fear wrong from Highlanders," said Catharine,
firmly; "especially as I thought Conachar was with them.Conachar has
drunk of our cup and eaten of our bread; and my father has often had
traffic with Highlanders, and never was there wrong or quarrel betwixt
him and them."replied Hector, for such is the Saxon equivalent for Eachin,
"what!never when he took the part of the Gow Chrom (the bandy legged
smith) against Eachin MacIan?Say nothing to excuse it, and believe it
will be your own fault if I ever again allude to it.But you had some
command to lay upon me; speak, and you shall be obeyed."Catharine hastened to reply; for there was something in the young
chief's manner and language which made her desire to shorten the
interview."Eachin," she said, "since Conachar is no longer your name, you ought
to be sensible that in claiming, as I honestly might, a service from my
equal, I little thought that I was addressing a person of such superior
power and consequence.You, as well as I, have been obliged to the
religious instruction of this good man.He is now in great danger:
wicked men have accused him with false charges, and he is desirous to
remain in safety and concealment till the storm shall pass away."Ay, the worthy clerk did much for me, and
more than my rugged temper was capable to profit by.I will be glad to
see any one in the town of Perth persecute one who hath taken hold of
MacIan's mantle!""It may not be safe to trust too much to that," said Catharine."I
nothing doubt the power of your tribe; but when the Black Douglas takes
up a feud, he is not to be scared by the shaking of a Highland plaid."The Highlander disguised his displeasure at this speech with a forced
laugh."The sparrow," he said, "that is next the eye seems larger than the
eagle that is perched on Bengoile.You fear the Douglasses most, because
they sit next to you.You will not believe how
wide our hills, and vales, and forests extend beyond the dusky barrier
of yonder mountains, and you think all the world lies on the banks of
the Tay.But this good clerk shall see hills that could hide him were
all the Douglasses on his quest--ay, and he shall see men enough also
to make them glad to get once more southward of the Grampians.And
wherefore should you not go with the good man?I will send a party to
bring him in safety from Perth, and we will set up the old trade beyond
Loch Tay--only no more cutting out of gloves for me.I will find your
father in hides, but I will not cut them, save when they are on the
creatures' backs.""My father will come one day and see your housekeeping, Conachar--I
mean, Hector.But times must be quieter, for there is feud between the
townspeople and the followers of the noblemen, and there is speech of
war about to break out in the Highlands.""Yes, by Our Lady, Catharine!and were it not for that same Highland
war, you should nor thus put off your Highland visit, my pretty
mistress.But the race of the hills are no longer to be divided into two
nations.They will fight like men for the supremacy, and he who gets it
will deal with the King of Scotland as an equal, not as a superior.Pray
that the victory may fall to MacIan, my pious St.Catharine, for thou
shalt pray for one who loves thee dearly.""I will pray for the right," said Catharine; "or rather, I will pray
that there be peace on all sides.Farewell, kind and excellent Father
Clement.Believe I shall never forget thy lessons; remember me in thy
prayers.But how wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome?""They shall carry him if need be," said Hector, "if we go far without
finding a horse for him.But you, Catharine--it is far from hence to
Perth.Let me attend you thither as I was wont.""If you were as you were wont, I would not refuse your escort.But gold
brooches and bracelets are perilous company, when the Liddesdale and
Annandale lancers are riding as throng upon the highway as the leaves
at Hallowmass; and there is no safe meeting betwixt Highland tartans and
steel jackets."She hazarded this remark, as she somewhat suspected that, in casting his
slough, young Eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits which he had
acquired in his humbler state, and that, though he might use bold words,
he would not be rash enough to brave the odds of numbers, to which a
descent into the vicinity of the city would be likely to expose him.It
appeared that she judged correctly; for, after a farewell, in which she
compounded for the immunity of her lips by permitting him to kiss her
hand, she returned towards Perth, and could obtain at times, when
she looked back, an occasional glance of the Highlanders, as, winding
through the most concealed and impracticable paths, they bent their way
towards the North.She felt in part relieved from her immediate anxiety, as the distance
increased betwixt her and these men, whose actions were only directed by
the will of their chief, and whose chief was a giddy and impetuous boy.She apprehended no insult on her return to Perth from the soldiery of
any party whom she might meet; for the rules of chivalry were in those
days a surer protection to a maiden of decent appearance than an escort
of armed men, whose cognizance might not be acknowledged as friendly
by any other party whom they might chance to encounter.But more remote
dangers pressed on her apprehension.The pursuit of the licentious
Prince was rendered formidable by threats which his unprincipled
counsellor, Ramorny, had not shunned to utter against her father, if she
persevered in her coyness.These menaces, in such an age, and from such
a character, were deep grounds for alarm; nor could she consider the
pretensions to her favour which Conachar had scarce repressed during his
state of servitude, and seemed now to avow boldly, as less fraught with
evil, since there had been repeated incursions of the Highlanders into
the very town of Perth, and citizens had, on more occasions than one,
been made prisoners and carried off from their own houses, or had fallen
by the claymore in the very streets of their city.She feared, too, her
father's importunity on behalf of the smith, of whose conduct on St.Valentine's Day unworthy reports had reached her; and whose suit, had
he stood clear in her good opinion, she dared not listen to, while
Ramorny's threats of revenge upon her father rung on her ear.She
thought on these various dangers with the deepest apprehension, and an
earnest desire to escape from them and herself, by taking refuge in the
cloister; but saw no possibility of obtaining her father's consent to
the only course from which she expected peace and protection.In the course of these reflections, we cannot discover that she very
distinctly regretted that her perils attended her because she was the
Fair Maid of Perth.This was one point which marked that she was not
yet altogether an angel; and perhaps it was another that, in despite of
Henry Smith's real or supposed delinquencies, a sigh escaped from her
bosom when she thought upon St.Oh, for a draught of power to steep
     The soul of agony in sleep!We have shown the secrets of the confessional; those of the sick
chamber are not hidden from us.The darkened apartment, where salves and
medicines showed that the leech had been busy in his craft, a tall thin
form lay on a bed, arrayed in a nightgown belted around him, with
pain on his brow, and a thousand stormy passions agitating his bosom.Everything in the apartment indicated a man of opulence and of expense.Henbane Dwining, the apothecary, who seemed to have the care of the
patient, stole with a crafty and catlike step from one corner of the
room to another, busying himself with mixing medicines and preparing
dressings.The sick man groaned once or twice, on which the leech,
advancing to his bedside, asked whether these sounds were a token of the
pain of his body or of the distress of his mind."Of both, thou poisoning varlet," said Sir John Ramorny, "and of being
encumbered with thy accursed company.""If that is all, I can relieve your knighthood of one of these ills
by presently removing myself elsewhere.Thanks to the feuds of this
boisterous time, had I twenty hands, instead of these two poor servants
of my art (displaying his skinny palms), there is enough of employment
for them--well requited employment, too, where thanks and crowns contend
which shall best pay my services; while you, Sir John, wreak upon your
chirurgeon the anger you ought only to bear against the author of your
wound.""Villain, it is beneath me to reply to thee," said the patient; "but
every word of thy malignant tongue is a dirk, inflicting wounds which
set all the medicines of Arabia at defiance.""Sir John, I understand you not; but if you give way to these
tempestuous fits of rage, it is impossible but fever and inflammation
must be the result.""Why then dost thou speak in a sense to chafe my blood?Why dost thou
name the supposition of thy worthless self having more hands than
nature gave thee, while I, a knight and gentleman, am mutilated like a
<DW36>?""Sir John," replied the chirurgeon, "I am no divine, nor a mainly
obstinate believer in some things which divines tell us.Yet I may
remind you that you have been kindly dealt with; for if the blow which
has done you this injury had lighted on your neck, as it was aimed, it
would have swept your head from your shoulders, instead of amputating a
less considerable member.""I wish it had, Dwining--I wish it had lighted as it was addressed.I
should not then have seen a policy which had spun a web so fine as mine
burst through by the brute force of a drunken churl.I should not have
been reserved to see horses which I must not mount, lists which I must
no longer enter, splendours which I cannot hope to share, or battles
which I must not take part in.I should not, with a man's passions for
power and for strife, be set to keep place among the women, despised by
them, too, as a miserable, impotent <DW36>, unable to aim at obtaining
the favour of the sex.""Supposing all this to be so, I will yet pray of your knighthood to
remark," replied Dwining, still busying himself with arranging the
dressings of the wounds, "that your eyes, which you must have lost
with your head, may, being spared to you, present as rich a prospect of
pleasure as either ambition, or victory in the list or in the field, or
the love of woman itself, could have proposed to you.""My sense is too dull to catch thy meaning, leech," replied Ramorny."What is this precious spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck?""The dearest that mankind knows," replied Dwining; and then, in the
accent of a lover who utters the name of his beloved mistress, and
expresses his passion for her in the very tone of his voice, he added
the word "REVENGE!"The patient had raised himself on his couch to listen with some anxiety
for the solution of the physician's enigma.He laid himself down again
as he heard it explained, and after a short pause asked, "In what
Christian college learned you this morality, good Master Dwining?""In no Christian college," answered his physician; "for, though it is
privately received in most, it is openly and manfully adopted in none.But I have studied among the sages of Granada, where the fiery souled
Moor lifts high his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemy's blood,
and avows the doctrine which the pallid Christian practises, though
coward-like he dare not name it.""Thou art then a more high souled villain than I deemed thee," said
Ramorny."The waters that are the stillest are
also the deepest; and the foe is most to be dreaded who never threatens
till he strikes.You knights and men at arms go straight to your purpose
with sword in hand.We who are clerks win our access with a noiseless
step and an indirect approach, but attain our object not less surely.""And I," said the knight, "who have trod to my revenge with a mailed
foot, which made all echo around it, must now use such a slipper as
thine--ha?""He who lacks strength," said the wily mediciner, "must attain his
purpose by skill.""And tell me sincerely, mediciner, wherefore thou wouldst read me these
devil's lessons?Why wouldst thou thrust me faster or farther on to my
vengeance than I may seem to thee ready to go of my own accord?I am old
in the ways of the world, man; and I know that such as thou do not drop
words in vain, or thrust themselves upon the dangerous confidence of men
like me save with the prospect of advancing some purpose of their own.What interest hast thou in the road, whether peaceful or bloody, which I
may pursue on these occurrents?""In plain dealing, sir knight, though it is what I seldom use," answered
the leech, "my road to revenge is the same with yours."said Ramorny, with a tone of scornful surprise."I
thought it had been high beyond thy reach.Thou aim at the same revenge
with Ramorny?""Ay, truly," replied Dwining, "for the smithy churl under whose blow you
have suffered has often done me despite and injury.He has thwarted
me in counsel and despised me in action.His brutal and unhesitating
bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety of my natural
disposition."And you hope to hind an active coadjutor in me?"said Ramorny, in the
same supercilious tone as before."But know, the artisan fellow is too
low in degree to be to me either the object of hatred or of fear.We hate not the reptile that has stung us, though we
might shake it off the wound, and tread upon it.I know the ruffian of
old as a stout man at arms, and a pretender, as I have heard, to the
favour of the scornful puppet whose beauties, forsooth, spurred us to
our wise and hopeful attempt.Fiends that direct this nether world,
by what malice have ye decided that the hand which has couched a lance
against the bosom of a prince should be struck off like a sapling by
the blow of a churl, and during the turmoil of a midnight riot?Well,
mediciner, thus far our courses hold together, and I bid thee well
believe that I will crush for thee this reptile mechanic.But do not
thou think to escape me when that part of my revenge is done which will
be most easily and speedily accomplished.""Not, it may be, altogether so easily accomplished," said the
apothecary; "for if your knighthood will credit me, there will be
found small ease or security in dealing with him.He is the strongest,
boldest, and most skilful swordsman in Perth and all the country around
it.""Fear nothing; he shall be met with had he the strength of Sampson.Hope not thou to escape my vengeance, unless thou become
my passive agent in the scene which is to follow.I have studied at no Moorish college, and lack some of
thy unbounded appetite for revenge, but yet I will have my share of
vengeance.Listen to me, mediciner, while I shall thus far unfold
myself; but beware of treachery, for, powerful as thy fiend is, thou
hast taken lessons from a meaner devil than mine.Hearken--the master
whom I have served through vice and virtue, with too much zeal for my
own character, perhaps, but with unshaken fidelity to him--the very man,
to soothe whose frantic folly I have incurred this irreparable loss, is,
at the prayer of his doating father, about to sacrifice me, by turning
me out of his favour, and leaving me at the mercy of the hypocritical
relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation at my expense.If he perseveres in this most ungrateful purpose, thy fiercest Moors,
were their complexion swarthy as the smoke of hell, shall blush to see
their revenge outdone.But I will give him one more chance for honour
and safety before my wrath shall descend on him in unrelenting and
unmitigated fury.There, then, thus far thou hast my confidence.Where is the hand that
should be the pledge and representative of Ramorny's plighted word?Is it nailed on the public pillory, or flung as offal to the houseless
dogs, who are even now snarling over it?Lay thy finger on the mutilated
stump, then, and swear to be a faithful actor in my revenge, as I shall
be in yours.How now, sir leech look you pale--you, who say to death,
stand back or advance, can you tremble to think of him or to hear him
named?I have not mentioned your fee, for one who loves revenge for
itself requires no deeper bribe; yet, if broad lands and large sums of
gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause, believe me, these shall not
be lacking.""They tell for something in my humble wishes," said Dwining: "the poor
man in this bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a crowd, and
so trodden under foot; the rich and powerful rise like giants above the
press, and are at ease, while all is turmoil around them.""Then shalt thou arise above the press, mediciner, as high as gold
can raise thee.This purse is weighty, yet it is but an earnest of thy
guerdon.""And this Smith, my noble benefactor," said the leech, as he pouched the
gratuity--"this Henry of the Wynd, or what ever is his name--would not
the news that he hath paid the penalty of his action assuage the pain of
thy knighthood's wound better than the balm of Mecca with which I have
salved it?""He is beneath the thoughts of Ramorny; and I have no more resentment
against him than I have ill will at the senseless weapon which he
swayed.But it is just thy hate should be vented upon him.Where is he
chiefly to be met with?""That also I have considered," said Dwining."To make the attempt by day
in his own house were too open and dangerous, for he hath five servants
who work with him at the stithy, four of them strong knaves, and all
loving to their master.By night were scarce less desperate, for he hath
his doors strongly secured with bolt of oak and bar of iron, and ere the
fastenings of his house could be forced, the neighbourhood would rise to
his rescue, especially as they are still alarmed by the practice on St."Oh, ay, true, mediciner," said Ramorny, "for deceit is thy nature even
with me: thou knewest my hand and signet, as thou said'st, when that
hand was found cast out on the street, like the disgusting refuse of
a shambles--why, having such knowledge, went'st thou with these
jolterheaded citizens to consult that Patrick Charteris, whose spurs
should be hacked off from his heels for the communion which he holds
with paltry burghers, and whom thou brought'st here with the fools to do
dishonour to the lifeless hand, which, had it held its wonted place, he
was not worthy to have touched in peace or faced in war?""My noble patron, as soon as I had reason to know you had been the
sufferer, I urged them with all my powers of persuasion to desist from
prosecuting the feud; but the swaggering smith, and one or two other hot
heads, cried out for vengeance.Your knighthood must know this fellow
calls himself bachelor to the Fair Maiden of Perth, and stands upon his
honour to follow up her father's quarrel; but I have forestalled his
market in that quarter, and that is something in earnest of revenge.""How mean you by that, sir leech?""Your knighthood shall conceive," said the mediciner, "that this smith
doth not live within compass, but is an outlier and a galliard.Valentine's Day, shortly after the affray between the
townsfolk and the followers of Douglas.Yes, I met him sneaking through
the lanes and bye passages with a common minstrel wench, with her messan
and her viol on his one arm and her buxom self hanging upon the other.Is not this a trim squire, to cross a prince's
love with the fairest girl in Perth, strike off the hand of a knight and
baron, and become gentleman usher to a strolling glee woman, all in the
course of the same four and twenty hours?""Marry, I think the better of him that he has so much of a gentleman's
humour, clown though he be," said Ramorny."I would he had been a
precisian instead of a galliard, and I should have had better heart to
aid thy revenge.And such revenge!--revenge on a smith--in the quarrel
of a pitiful manufacturer of rotten cheverons!And yet it shall
be taken in full.Thou hast commenced it, I warrant me, by thine own
manoeuvres.""In a small degree only," said the apothecary."I took care that two or
three of the most notorious gossips in Curfew street, who liked not to
hear Catharine called the Fair Maid of Perth, should be possessed
of this story of her faithful Valentine.They opened on the scent so
keenly, that, rather than doubt had fallen on the tale, they would have
vouched for it as if their own eyes had seen it.The lover came to
her father's within an hour after, and your worship may think what a
reception he had from the angry glover, for the damsel herself would not
be looked upon.And thus your honour sees I had a foretaste of revenge.But I trust to receive the full draught from the hands of your lordship,
with whom I am in a brotherly league, which--"

"Brotherly!""But be it so, the priests
say we are all of one common earth.I cannot tell, there seems to me
some difference; but the better mould shall keep faith with the baser,
and thou shalt have thy revenge.A young man made his appearance from the anteroom upon the physician's
summons."Eviot," said the knight, "does Bonthron wait?"He is as sober as sleep can make him after a deep drink," answered the
page."Then fetch him hither, and do thou shut the door."A heavy step presently approached the apartment, and a man entered,
whose deficiency of height seemed made up in breadth of shoulders and
strength of arm."There is a man thou must deal upon, Bonthron," said the knight.The man
smoothed his rugged features and grinned a smile of satisfaction."That mediciner will show thee the party.Take such advantage of time,
place, and circumstance as will ensure the result; and mind you come not
by the worst, for the man is the fighting Smith of the Wynd.""It Will be a tough job," growled the assassin; "for if I miss my blow,
I may esteem myself but a dead man.All Perth rings with the smith's
skill and strength.""Take two assistants with thee," said the knight."If you double anything, let it be the reward.""Account it doubled," said his master; "but see thy work be thoroughly
executed.""Trust me for that, sir knight: seldom have I failed.""Use this sage man's directions," said the wounded knight, pointing to
the physician."And hark thee, await his coming forth, and drink not
till the business be done.""I will not," answered the dark satellite; "my own life depends on my
blow being steady and sure."Vanish, then, till he summons you, and have axe and dagger in
readiness.""Will your knighthood venture to entrust such an act to a single hand?"said the mediciner, when the assassin had left the room."May I pray you
to remember that yonder party did, two nights since, baffle six armed
men?""Question me not, sir mediciner: a man like Bonthron, who knows time and
place, is worth a score of confused revellers.Call Eviot; thou shalt
first exert thy powers of healing, and do not doubt that thou shalt,
in the farther work, be aided by one who will match thee in the art of
sudden and unexpected destruction."The page Eviot again appeared at the mediciner's summons, and at his
master's sign assisted the chirurgeon in removing the dressings from
Sir John Ramorny's wounded arm.Dwining viewed the naked stump with
a species of professional satisfaction, enhanced, no doubt, by the
malignant pleasure which his evil disposition took in the pain and
distress of his fellow creatures.The knight just turned his eye on the
ghastly spectacle, and uttered, under the pressure of bodily pain or
mental agony, a groan which he would fain have repressed."You groan, sir," said the leech, in his soft, insinuating tone of
voice, but with a sneer of enjoyment, mixed with scorn, curling upon
his lip, which his habitual dissimulation could not altogether
disguise--"you groan; but be comforted.This Henry Smith knows his
business: his sword is as true to its aim as his hammer to the anvil.Had a common swordsman struck this fatal blow, he had harmed the bone
and damaged the muscles, so that even my art might not have been able
to repair them.But Henry Smith's cut is clean, and as sure as that with
which my own scalpel could have made the amputation.In a few days you
will be able, with care and attention to the ordinances of medicine, to
stir abroad.""But my hand--the loss of my hand--"

"It may be kept secret for a time," said the mediciner."I have
possessed two or three tattling fools, in deep confidence, that the hand
which was found was that of your knighthood's groom, Black Quentin, and
your knighthood knows that he has parted for Fife, in such sort as to
make it generally believed.""I know well enough," said Ramorny, "that the rumour may stifle the
truth for a short time."It may be concealed till your knighthood retires for a time from the
court, and then, when new accidents have darkened the recollection
of the present stir, it may be imputed to a wound received from the
shivering of a spear, or from a crossbow bolt.Your slave will find a
suitable device, and stand for the truth of it.""The thought maddens me," said Ramorny, with another groan of mental and
bodily agony; "yet I see no better remedy.""There is none other," said the leech, to whose evil nature his patron's
distress was delicious nourishment."In the mean while, it is believed
you are confined by the consequences of some bruises, aiding the sense
of displeasure at the Prince's having consented to dismiss you from his
household at the remonstrance of Albany, which is publicly known.""Villain, thou rack'st me!""Upon the whole, therefore," said Dwining, "your knighthood has escaped
well, and, saving the lack of your hand, a mischance beyond remedy,
you ought rather to rejoice than complain; for no barber chirurgeon in
France or England could have more ably performed the operation than this
churl with one downright blow.""I understand my obligation fully," said Ramorny, struggling with his
anger, and affecting composure; "and if Bonthron pays him not with a
blow equally downright, and rendering the aid of the leech unnecessary,
say that John of Ramorny cannot requite an obligation.""That is spoke like yourself, noble knight!""And let me further say, that the operator's skill must have been
vain, and the hemorrhage must have drained your life veins, but for the
bandages, the cautery, and the styptics applied by the good monks, and
the poor services of your humble vassal, Henbane Dwining.""Peace," exclaimed the patient, "with thy ill omened voice and worse
omened name!Methinks, as thou mentionest the tortures I have undergone,
my tingling nerves stretch and contract themselves as if they still
actuated the fingers that once could clutch a dagger.""That," explained the leech, "may it please your knighthood, is a
phenomenon well known to our profession.There have been those among
the ancient sages who have thought that there still remained a sympathy
between the severed nerves and those belonging to the amputated
limb; and that the several fingers are seen to quiver and strain, as
corresponding with the impulse which proceeds from their sympathy with
the energies of the living system.Could we recover the hand from the
Cross, or from the custody of the Black Douglas, I would be pleased to
observe this wonderful operation of occult sympathies.But, I fear me,
one might as safely go to wrest the joint from the talons of an hungry
eagle.""And thou mayst as safely break thy malignant jests on a wounded lion as
on John of Ramorny," said the knight, raising himself in uncontrollable
indignation."Caitiff, proceed to thy duty; and remember, that if my
hand can no longer clasp a dagger, I can command an hundred.""The sight of one drawn and brandished in anger were sufficient," said
Dwining, "to consume the vital powers of your chirurgeon.But who then,"
he added in a tone partly insinuating, partly jeering--"who would then
relieve the fiery and scorching pain which my patron now suffers, and
which renders him exasperated even with his poor servant for quoting the
rules of healing, so contemptible, doubtless, compared with the power of
inflicting wounds?"Then, as daring no longer to trifle with the mood of his dangerous
patient, the leech addressed himself seriously to salving the wound,
and applied a fragrant balm, the odour of which was diffused through the
apartment, while it communicated a refreshing coolness, instead of the
burning heat--a change so gratifying to the fevered patient, that, as
he had before groaned with agony, he could not now help sighing for
pleasure, as he sank back on his couch to enjoy the ease which the
dressing bestowed."Your knightly lordship now knows who is your friend," said Dwining;
"had you yielded to a rash impulse, and said, 'Slay me this worthless
quacksalver,' where, within the four seas of Britain, would you have
found the man to have ministered to you as much comfort?""Forget my threats, good leech," said Ramorny, "and beware how you tempt
me.Such as I brook not jests upon our agony.See thou keep thy scoffs,
to pass upon misers [that is, miserable persons, as used in Spenser and
other writers of his time, though the sense is now restricted to those
who are covetous] in the hospital."Dwining ventured to say no more, but poured some drops from a phial
which he took from his pocket into a small cup of wine allayed with
water."This draught," said the man of art, "is medicated to produce a sleep
which must not be interrupted.""The period of its operation is uncertain--perhaps till morning.""Sir mediciner, taste me that
liquor presently, else it passes not my lips."The leech obeyed him, with a scornful smile."I would drink the whole
with readiness; but the juice of this Indian gum will bring sleep on the
healthy man as well as upon the patient, and the business of the leech
requires me to be a watcher.""I crave your pardon, sir leech," said Ramorny, looking downwards, as if
ashamed to have manifested suspicion."There is no room for pardon where offence must not be taken," answered
the mediciner."An insect must thank a giant that he does not tread on
him.Yet, noble knight, insects have their power of harming as well as
physicians.What would it have cost me, save a moment's trouble, so to
have drugged that balm, as should have made your arm rot to the shoulder
joint, and your life blood curdle in your veins to a corrupted jelly?What is there that prevented me to use means yet more subtle, and to
taint your room with essences, before which the light of life twinkles
more and more dimly, till it expires, like a torch amidst the foul
vapours of some subterranean dungeon?You little estimate my power, if
you know not that these and yet deeper modes of destruction stand
at command of my art.But a physician slays not the patient by whose
generosity he lives, and far less will he the breath of whose nostrils
is the hope of revenge destroy the vowed ally who is to favour his
pursuit of it.Yet one word; should a necessity occur for rousing
yourself--for who in Scotland can promise himself eight hours'
uninterrupted repose?--then smell at the strong essence contained in
this pouncet box.And now, farewell, sir knight; and if you cannot think
of me as a man of nice conscience, acknowledge me at least as one of
reason and of judgment."So saying, the mediciner left the room, his usual mean and shuffling
gait elevating itself into something more noble, as conscious of a
victory over his imperious patient.Sir John Ramorny remained sunk in unpleasing reflections until he began
to experience the incipient effects of his soporific draught.He then
roused himself for an instant, and summoned his page.I have done ill to unbosom myself so far to this
poisonous quacksalver."Yes, so please your knighthood.""Bonthron spoke apart with him, and followed him almost immediately--by
your lordship's command, as I understood him."he goes to seek some medicaments; he will return anon.If he be intoxicated, see he comes not near my chamber, and permit him
not to enter into converse with any one.He raves when drink has touched
his brain.He was a rare fellow before a Southron bill laid his brain
pan bare; but since that time he talks gibberish whenever the cup has
crossed his lips.Said the leech aught to you, Eviot?""Nothing, save to reiterate his commands that your honour be not
disturbed.""Which thou must surely obey," said the knight."I feel the summons to
rest, of which I have been deprived since this unhappy wound.At least,
if I have slept it has been but for a snatch.Aid me to take off my
gown, Eviot.""May God and the saints send you good rest, my lord," said the page,
retiring after he had rendered his wounded master the assistance
required.As Eviot left the room, the knight, whose brain was becoming more and
more confused, muttered over the page's departing salutation."God--saints--I have slept sound under such a benison.But now, methinks
if I awake not to the accomplishment of my proud hopes of power and
revenge, the best wish for me is, that the slumbers which now fall
around my head were the forerunners of that sleep which shall return
my borrowed powers to their original nonexistence--I can argue it no
farther."Thus speaking, he fell into a profound sleep.On Fastern's E'en when we war fou.The night which sunk down on the sickbed of Ramorny was not doomed to be
a quiet one.Two hours had passed since curfew bell, then rung at seven
o'clock at night, and in those primitive times all were retired to rest,
excepting such whom devotion, or duty, or debauchery made watchers; and
the evening being that of Shrovetide, or, as it was called in Scotland,
Fastern's E'en, the vigils of gaiety were by far the most frequented of
the three.The common people had, throughout the day, toiled and struggled at
football; the nobles and gentry had fought cocks, and hearkened to the
wanton music of the minstrel; while the citizens had gorged themselves
upon pancakes fried in lard, and brose, or brewis--the fat broth, that
is, in which salted beef had been boiled, poured upon highly toasted
oatmeal, a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple, old
fashioned Scottish palates.These were all exercises and festive dishes
proper to the holiday.It was no less a solemnity of the evening that
the devout Catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had
means to procure; and, if young and able, that he should dance at the
ring, or figure among the morrice dancers, who, in the city of Perth,
as elsewhere, wore a peculiarly fantastic garb, and distinguished
themselves by their address and activity.All this gaiety took place
under the prudential consideration that the long term of Lent, now
approaching, with
