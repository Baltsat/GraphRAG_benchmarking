"It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Sandra went back to the bathroom.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."Mary moved to the garden.exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

Much, if not all, of the adverse criticism of the Boston which has been
offered by educators, parents and other responsible objectors, has been
directed at the relative positions of the partners.This is, in fact, no
more than the general rule as regards the Social Round Dance, with the
possible exception that the positions have been sometimes distorted by
attempts to copy the freer forms of dancing that have been presented
upon the stage.The Round Dance demands that a certain fixed grouping of the partners be
maintained in order that the rotation around a common moving centre may
be accomplished, and it is here that the most serious problem is to be
found.The dancing profession long ago undertook to settle upon arbitrary
groupings satisfactory to the needs of the dancers, and conforming to
all the requirements of propriety and hygienic exercise.[Illustration]

Acting upon this basis, the reputable teachers of dancing throughout the
world have adopted and promulgated three fundamental groupings for the
Round Dance which are so constructed as to provide the greatest ease of
execution and freedom of action.They are known as the Waltz Position,
the Open Position, and the Side Position of the Waltz.All round dances
are executed in one or another of these groupings, which are not only
accepted by all good teachers, but, with the exception of certain minor
and unimportant variations, rigidly adhered to in all their work.In the Waltz Position the partners stand facing one another, with
shoulders parallel, and looking over one another's right shoulder.Special attention must be paid to the parallel position of the
shoulders, in order to fit the individual movements of the partners
along the line of direction.The gentleman places his right hand lightly upon the lady's back, at a
point about half-way across, between the waist-line and the
shoulder-blades.The fingers are so rounded as to permit the free
circulation of air between the palm of the hand and the lady's back, and
should not be spread.The lady places her left hand lightly upon the gentleman's arm, allowing
her fore-arm to rest gently upon his arm.The partners stand at an easy
distance from one another, inclining toward the common centre very
slightly.The free hands are lightly joined at the side.This is merely
to provide occupation for the disengaged arms, and the gentleman holds
the tip of the lady's hand lightly in the bended fingers of his own.Guiding is accomplished by the gentleman through a slight lifting of his
right elbow.[Illustration]


THE OPEN POSITION

The Open Position needs no explanation, and can be readily understood
from the illustration facing page 8.THE SIDE POSITION OF THE WALTZ

The side position of the Waltz differs from the Waltz Position only in
the fact that the partners stand side by side and with the engaged arms
more widely extended.The free arms are held as in the frontispiece.In
the actual rotation this position naturally resolves itself into the
regular Waltz Position.THE STEP OF THE BOSTON

The preparatory step of the Boston differs materially from that of any
other Social Dance.There is _only one position_ of the feet in the
Boston--the 4th.That is to say, the feet are separated one from the
other as in walking.On the first count of the measure the whole leg swings freely, and as a
unit, from the hip, and the foot is put down practically flat upon the
floor, where it immediately receives the entire weight of the body
_perpendicularly_.The weight is held entirely upon this foot during the
remainder of the measure, whether it be in 3/4 or 2/4 time.The following preparatory exercises must be practiced forward and
backward until the movements become natural, before proceeding.In going backward, the foot must be carried to the rear as far as
possible, and the weight must always be perpendicular to the supporting
foot.These movements are identical with walking, and except the particular
care which must be bestowed upon the placing of the foot on the first
count of the measure, they require no special degree of attention.On the second count the free leg swings forward until the knee has
become entirely straightened, and is held, suspended, during the third
count of the measure.This should be practiced, first with the weight
resting upon the entire sole of the supporting foot, and then, when this
has been perfectly accomplished, the same exercise may be supplemented
by raising the heel (of the supporting foot) on the second count and
lowering it on the third count._Great care must be taken not to divide
the weight._

For the purpose of instruction, it is well to practice these steps to
Mazurka music, because of the clearness of the count.[Illustration]

When the foregoing exercises have been so fully mastered as to become,
in a sense, muscular habits, we may, with safety, add the next feature.This consists in touching the floor with the point of the free foot, at
a point as far forward or backward as can be done without dividing the
weight, on the second count of the measure.Thus, we have accomplished,
as it were, an interrupted, or, at least, an arrested step, and this is
the true essence of the Boston.Too great care cannot be expended upon this phase of the step, and it
must be practiced over and over again, both forward and backward, until
the movement has become second nature.All this must precede any attempt
to turn.Mary went back to the hallway.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,
the one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to
learners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,
and consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the
ground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,
and there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must
pass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half
turn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--

Starting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the
entire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14
(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee
and raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left
foot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any
weight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,
backward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time
lowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page
18 (count 3).[Illustration]

Starting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,
and with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot
lightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely
upon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as
shown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right
foot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible
upon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time
raising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);
and complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,
forward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the
left heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count
6).THE REVERSE

The reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the
rotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to
alternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the
turning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of
alternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see
preparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the
gentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole
turn.Sandra went to the office.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the
turn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,
and in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,
than that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure
to reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised
until one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The
writer has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only
helpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in
obviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent
unpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]

After acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to
Mazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of
Spanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more
liquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of
Danglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is
always opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,
the weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the
weight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the
dancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be
held back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round
dances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a
unique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement
becomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,
in order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for
greater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if
there were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more
difficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of
walking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a
whole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single
hour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its
physical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance
that we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the
maximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This
tends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at
the same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The
movements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps
which is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and
support the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of
the social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which
are now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely
refining influence of the action.[Illustration]

Of the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond
the description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated
in the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete
understanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further
the proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's
part.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._


THE LONG BOSTON

The ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is
commonly known as the "Long" Boston to distinguish it from other forms
and variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and
at any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it
should be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]


THE SHORT BOSTON

The "Short" Boston differs from the "Long" Boston only in measure.It is
danced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)
occupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements
each occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between
the "Long" and the "Short" Boston the same difference as between the
Waltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the "Short" Boston, the
rising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take
the form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less
fatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON

The "Open" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first
part is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages
8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the "Long"
Boston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,
without turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to
face directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the
position shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one
Boston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz
Position for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]


THE BOSTON DIP

The "Dip" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4
measures of the "Long" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:

Standing upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the
weight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in
front of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);
lower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original
place where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across
in front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the
left heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side
of the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across
in front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down
the left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it
(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and
finish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives
the weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the
movement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly
coincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]




THE TURKEY TROT

_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._


During the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning
(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,
stretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as
shown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)
swaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and
pointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *

  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in "The Gobbler" by
  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE


The "Aeroplane Glide" is very similar to the Boston Dip.John went back to the hallway.It is supposed
to represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its
name from that fact.The sole difference between the "Dip" and "Aeroplane" consists in the
six running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running
steps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before
and behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure
requires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is
noticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the "Dip".[Illustration]




THE TANGO


The Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the
peculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends
largely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the
music as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,
and the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend
themselves most readily to verbal description.1

The partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes
the lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full
extent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand
upon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration
opposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and
steps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows
forward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing
one foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same
direction.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the
whole is repeated at will.[Illustration]


TANGO No.2

This variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman
takes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two
steps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two
steps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as
the feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the
whole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE "BOSTON"

THE BOSTON MUSIC COMPANY 26 & 28 WEST ST., BOSTON, MASS.TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:


  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_."He ungraciously gave me permission to visit St.Louis in order to see
him, after I had begged for the privilege at least half a dozen times,"
Grant answered."And you laid the matter before him in all its bearings?"asked the commodore, starting in surprise."I mean," said he, "that he struck me metaphorically.I
don't believe he would have hurt me as badly, if he had really struck
me.I was never so cut in all my life.I came away feeling that I had
committed an unpardonable sin from a military standpoint.""Then he would not hear to the proposition at all?"I came away resolving never to ask
another favor of him.Yet so anxious am I to make this campaign that, as
you know, I swallowed my pride and united with you in making the request
that we be allowed to make the movement.""It is strange," replied the commodore, "that he should ignore both our
requests, not favoring us even with a reply.Yet it seems that he must
see that Fort Henry should be reduced at once.If we delay, both the
Cumberland and the Tennessee will be so strongly fortified that it will
be almost impossible to force a passage.Everything is to be gained by
moving at once."Even a civilian ought to see that," replied Grant, as he slowly blew a
cloud of smoke from his mouth, and watched it as it lazily curled
upward."The truth of it is," Grant continued slowly, as if weighing every word,
"too many of us are afraid that another general may win more honor than
we.Now, here are
Buell and myself; each with a separate command, yet both working for the
same object.I should either be subject to the command of Buell, or he
should be subject to my orders.We are now like two men trying to lift
the same burden, and instead of lifting together, one will lift and then
the other.Such a system can but prolong the war indefinitely.""General," said the commodore, earnestly, "I sincerely wish you had the
supreme command here in the West.I believe we would see different
results, and that very soon."Grant blushed like a schoolgirl, fidgeted in his seat, and then said:
"Commodore, you do me altogether too much honor.But this I will say, if
I had supreme command I should not sit still and see the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers fortified without raising a hand to prevent it.Neither do I believe in letting month after month go by for the purpose
of drilling and organizing.The Government seems to forget that time
gives the enemy the same privilege.What is wanted is hard blows, and
these blows should be delivered as soon as possible.Sherman was right
when he asked for 200,000 men to march to the Gulf, yet he was sneered
at by the War Department, hounded by every paper in the land, called
insane, and now he is occupying a subordinate position.The war could be
ended in a year.No one now can tell how long it will last."Just then a telegram was placed in Grant's hands.He read it, and his
whole face lighted up with pleasure."You look pleased," said the commodore."The telegram must bring good
news."Without a word Grant placed the telegram in the hands of the commodore.It was an order from General Halleck to move up the Tennessee as soon as
possible and capture Fort Henry."At last," said the commodore, his face showing as much pleasure as did
Grant's."At last," responded Grant; and then, quickly, "Commodore, we may have
done an injustice to General Halleck.There may be good reasons we know
not of why this order should not have been made before.Commodore, be
ready to move with your fleet to-morrow.""General, I shall be ready; and now good-bye, for both of us have much
before us.But before I go, let me congratulate you.I believe that
success and great honor await you," and with these words the commodore
withdrew.The next day, with 15,000 men, General Grant was steaming up the
Tennessee.General Buell sat in his headquarters at Louisville.General Nelson,
accompanied by Fred, had dropped in to see his general, and at the same
time to give vent to some of his pent-up feelings.he fumed, "for us to sit here and let the
Rebels fortify Bowling Green and Dover and Columbus, and build forts to
blockade the Tennessee, and we not raise a finger to prevent it."Buell smiled at his irate general, and asked: "And what would you do,
Nelson?"I would give
them precious little time to build forts."Before General Buell could answer, an orderly entered with a telegram.He read it, and turning to Nelson, said:

"Well, General, you can cease your fuming.This telegram is from General
Halleck.He tells me he has ordered General Grant up the Tennessee to
reduce Fort Henry, and he wants me to co-operate as much as possible in
the movement."Nelson was on his feet in an instant."General," he exclaimed, "I have a favor, a great favor to ask of you."Buell smilingly answered: "I think I know what it is without your
asking."I do not see how I can spare so many men; you know we have Johnston at
Bowling Green to look after.""But General," answered Nelson, "the Tennessee and Cumberland must be
defended.In all probability the most of Johnston's army will be
transferred there.""In that case, General," answered Buell, "I will remember you.Your
division shall be the first one sent.""Thank you, General, thank you," replied Nelson."I only wish I knew I
was going.""As it is now," continued Buell, "I shall order General Crittenden to
send Cruft's brigade.That brigade is near the mouth of Green river.There is no force of the enemy, in any number, before them, and the
brigade can well be spared.I shall send no more men unless it is
absolutely necessary.I shall at once dispatch an officer to General
Crittenden with necessary orders.""General," now spoke up Fred, "like General Nelson, I have a request to
make, and by your kindness I hope to meet with better success."said Buell, "you wish to carry the orders.If Nelson has no
objection, I think I can grant that request.The general has told me
something of your history, Mr.General Thomas also speaks
in the highest terms of you.""You can go if you wish, Fred," answered Nelson."I only hope I shall
soon be with you."So it was settled, and before night Fred and his good horse Prince were
on their way down the Ohio.Fred not only carried dispatches to General
Crittenden, but he had personal letters both from General Buell and
General Nelson to General Cruft commending him to the latter officer.Disembarking at Owensboro, Fred made a swift ride to Calhoun, the
headquarters of General Crittenden.He delivered his dispatches to the
general, and at once sought the headquarters of General Cruft.The
general read Fred's letters, and then said: "You are very welcome, Mr.Shackelford; you may consider yourself as one of my staff until such
time as General Nelson may join us."Soon orders came to General Cruft to at once prepare to join Grant.It was nearly noon on February the 14th when the fleet on which General
Cruft's brigade had embarked arrived at Fort Donelson.The place had
already been invested two days, and some severe fighting had taken
place.The weather, from being warm and rainy, had suddenly turned cold
on the afternoon of the 13th, and Fred shivered as he emerged from the
comfortable cabin of the steamboat and stepped out on the cold, desolate
bank of the river.The ground was covered with ice and snow, and the
scene was dreary in the extreme.Now and then the heavy reverberation of a cannon came rolling down the
river, and echoed and re-echoed among the hills.A fleet of gunboats lay
anchored in the river, the mouths of their great guns looking out over
the dark sullen water as though watching for their prey.General Cruft's
brigade was assigned to the division of General Lew Wallace, which
occupied the center of the Federal army.Back in the rear little groups
of soldiers stood shivering around small fires, trying to warm their
benumbed limbs, or to cook their scanty rations.The condition of the soldiers was pitiable in the extreme.There were
no tents; but few had overcoats, and many on the hard, muddy march from
Fort Henry had even thrown away their blankets.In the front lines no
fires could be lighted, and there the soldiers stood, exposed to the
furious storm of sleet and snow, hungry, benumbed, hardly knowing
whether they were dead or alive.Such were the heroes who stood for
three days before Donelson.As Fred looked on all this suffering, he wondered at the fortitude with
which it was endured.There were few complaints from the soldiers; they
were even cheerful and eager to meet the foe.About three o'clock the gunboats came steaming up the river and engaged
the Confederate batteries.It was a most sublime spectacle, and held Fred spellbound.The very
heavens seemed splitting, and the earth shook and trembled from the
heavy concussions.Nearer and nearer the gunboats came to the batteries
until it seemed to Fred the great guns were vomiting fire and smoke into
each other's throats.During the fight Fred noticed a small, thickset man sitting on his horse
intently watching the fight.His countenance was perfectly impassive,
and one could not tell by watching him whether he sympathized with
friend or foe.The boilers of the Essex had been
blown up, the other boats were bruised and battered and torn by the
great shots which had struck them, and were helplessly drifting down
the stream.From the Federal side there
went up a great groan of disappointment, while from the Confederate
lines there arose the wild cheers of victory.The silent man on horseback turned and rode away.Not a sign, not a word
that he was disappointed.asked Fred of an officer standing by him."That, young man," was the answer, "is General Grant.He must be awfully
cut up, but he does not show it."Fred turned and looked after Grant as he rode slowly away."There,"
thought Fred, "is a man who is going to make his mark in this war.In
some of his actions he reminds me of General Thomas.On the frozen ground, without tents or fire,
the soldiers once more made their beds.The wind sighed and moaned
through the bare branches, as if weeping at the suffering it caused.Many, to keep from freezing, never lay down, but kept up a weary march,
so that the blood might circulate.A council of war was
held, and it was resolved that in the morning they would cut their way
through the lines of steel which Grant had thrown around them.All
preparations were made, every order given, and then they waited for the
light of morning--the last morning that hundreds would ever see.It was hardly light when Fred was awakened by the fitful sound of
musketry over on the right.In front of Wallace's division only the
report of a rifle of a picket was heard now and then.Hurriedly eating a
little breakfast, he mounted his horse and reported to General Cruft for
duty.The men were all standing at arms, but there was nothing for them
to do.But over on the right the rattle of musketry grew more intense,
the roll of heavy volleys began to be heard, and then the deep-voiced
cannon joined in the chorus.Louder and louder grew the din of the
conflict.The smoke of battle began to ascend above the treetops like
smoke from a burning coal-pit.The sound of battle came nearer, the roll
of musketry was incessant, the thunder of cannon never ceased.An officer wild with excitement came spurring his foaming horse up to
General Wallace."General McClernand wants help," he gasped."The whole Rebel army has
attacked his division.""I have orders from General Grant to hold this position at all hazards,"
replied Wallace.To Grant's headquarters the officer rides in frantic haste.The general
was away; he had started at five o'clock to see Commodore Foote, who had
been wounded in the battle of the night before, and was on board of one
of his gunboats, and the boats lay some five or six miles below.Would not some one of his staff give orders to send reinforcements to
McClernand.The officer groaned,
and rode back to McClernand with the heavy tidings.Minutes go by, the thunder of battle is terrific.The exultant cheering of the advancing foe is heard above the
roar of conflict.Another officer, with his horse bleeding from wounds, his hat gone, and
tears streaming down his face, rides to General Wallace."For God's
sake, help!"he gasps, "or everything is lost; we are flanked, we cannot
hold out longer."Then General Wallace said: "I will take the responsibility; help you
shall have."And with his face lighted up with joy the officer dashed
back to tell McClernand that help was coming.An order comes to General Cruft to at once march his brigade to the
scene of action.No sooner is the command given than the brigade is on
the way.Soon shot and shell are crashing overhead, and singing bullets
begin to cut the twigs of the bushes around.Now and then a soldier
falters and goes down.A smooth-faced, florid man rides up to General
Cruft."I am Colonel Oglesby," he says; "my brigade is being flanked on
the right.Let me lead you in position; my men are nearly out of
ammunition."And then as calmly as if on parade Colonel Dick Oglesby
leads Cruft's brigade to the relief of his men.Soon the brigade is in
the midst of the conflict.The excitement of battle is on him, and he feels no fear.Oglesby's brigade is out of ammunition.Sullenly his men fall back,
leaving over 800 of their number dead and wounded on the field, but his
left regiment refuses to go.The colonel, a large, dark man, with hair
as black as midnight, eyes like flaming stars, rages up and down the
line like a lion.Fred asks of a wounded soldier hobbling back."Colonel John A. Logan," is the answer.At last his men are out of ammunition, and Logan, bleeding from two
wounds, is obliged to lead his regiment back.Another regiment takes its
place, and after a dreadful conflict, is compelled to fall back, leaving
over 300 of their number dead and wounded.Cruft's brigade was now on the extreme right, cut off from the rest of
the army.The enemy pressed upon them; a withering volley sent them
reeling back.Fred spurred forward, and seizing
the colors of a Kentucky regiment, shouted: "Now, boys, for the honor of
old Kentucky."But on either flank
the enemy pressed, and the brigade, combating every foot, was forced
back.The enemy had gained the desired end; McClernand's division was out of
the way, the road to retreat was open.Because of the imbecility of Generals Floyd and Pillow.Broken, and with a third of its number dead and wounded, McClernand's
division is driven back on Lew Wallace.Officers, stunned with the
disaster, come wildly galloping through Wallace's lines, shouting, "All
is lost!Wallace changes front to meet the exultant, advancing foe.Firm as
adamant his lines stand.In the faces of the charging Confederates his
men pour their crushing volleys.The enemy waver, reel, then go
staggering, bleeding back.In conference with Commodore Foote on
board of a gunboat six miles down the river.He is too far away to hear
the roll of musketry, and the thunder of artillery he thinks but
cannonading between the two lines.It is past noon when the conference
is ended and he is rowed ashore.There stands a staff officer with
bloodless face and shaking limbs.In a few words the story of the
disaster is told.Without a word Grant listens, and then mounts his
horse.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was a commission as captain, and detailed him as an independent
scout, subject to the orders of General William Nelson."Why, General," stammered Fred, "I didn't want this.You know, you told
me it was better for me not to enlist.""I know," responded Nelson, "but as you are with the army so much, it is
better for you to wear a uniform and have a rank that will command
respect."So Fred became "captain" in earnest.During his conversations with Nelson, Fred told him what he had heard
his father say to his aunt about Grant and Buell being crushed in
detail, and the general became thoroughly imbued with the idea that the
army at Pittsburg Landing was in grave danger.He chafed like a caged tiger at the delay in crossing Duck
river.At length he sought Buell, who laughed at his fears, and said
that he would not move until the bridge was completed."Why, Nelson, what's the matter with you any way?""Here we have been puttering
with this bridge for nearly a week, and all this time the force at
Pittsburg Landing is in danger of being attacked and annihilated."Buell leaned back in his chair, and looking quizzically at Nelson, said:

"You seem to know more about it, General, than either Halleck or Grant.Halleck telegraphed me that there is no danger of the force at Pittsburg
Landing being attacked.""I don't care what Halleck telegraphs," roared Nelson, now thoroughly
aroused."I tell you there is; I feel it, I know it."asked Buell, showing considerable interest.A small force encamped only
twenty miles from Corinth, where Johnston is concentrating his army.Johnston is a fool if he doesn't attack, and no one yet has ever accused
him of being one.General, give my division the advance; let me ford
Duck river."Buell was really fond of Nelson, despite his rough, overbearing ways,
and after some hesitation gave him the required permission.The life of
General Grant might not read as it does now, if that permission had been
withheld.On the morning of March 29th Nelson's division forded Duck river, and
started on its forced march for Savannah, on the Tennessee river.On
this march Nelson showed no mercy to stragglers, and many were the
curses heaped upon his head.One day Fred found a boy, no older than himself, lashed behind a cannon.The lad belonged to an Indiana regiment that in some manner had incurred
the displeasure of the general, and he was particularly severe on
members of this regiment if found straggling.The boy in question had
been found away from his command, and had been tied by his wrists to a
cannon.Behind this gun he had to march through the mud, every jolt
sending sharp pain through his wrists and arms, and if he should fall
life itself would be imperiled.It was a heartless, and in this case,
cruel punishment.Fred noticed the boy, and rode up to him and asked him
his name, and he gave it as Hugh Raymond.He was a fine-looking fellow,
and seemed to feel deeply his humiliation.He was covered with mud, and
the tears that he could not hold back had left their dirty trail down
his cheeks.Fred went to Nelson, begged for the boy's release, and got
it.It was but few requests that Nelson would not grant Fred.When Nelson started on his march to Savannah he expected to reach that
place on April 7th.But once on the march his eagerness increased, and
he resolved to reach Savannah, if possible, by the 4th, or at least the
5th of the month.On the morning of the third day's march Fred met with an adventure that
haunted him for years afterward.He never thought of it without a
shudder, and over and over again he lived it in his dreams, awaking with
a cry of agony that sounded unearthly to those who heard it.General Nelson and staff had put up at the commodious house of a planter
named Lane.They were most hospitably entertained, although Mr.Lane
made no secret of the fact that he was an ardent sympathizer with the
South.In the morning, as Fred was about to mount his horse to resume the
march, he discovered that he had left his field-glass in the room he had
occupied during the night.On returning for it, he heard voices in the
next room, one of which sounded so familiar that he stopped a moment to
listen, and to his amazement recognized the voice of his cousin Calhoun.One thing was certain; he
had been exchanged and was once more in the army.Lane
were engaged in earnest conversation, and Fred soon learned that his
cousin had been concealed in the house during the night."I have," replied Calhoun, "thanks to your kindness.I heard Nelson say
he would rush his division through, and that he wanted to be in Savannah
by the 5th.Johnston must,
shall strike Grant before that time.I must be in Corinth within the
next twenty-four hours, if I kill a dozen horses in getting there.Is
my horse where I left him, at the stable in the woods?"Lane; "and well cared for and groomed.But
breakfast is ready; you must eat a hearty meal before you start."Fred realized that the fate of an army was at stake.Something must be
done, and that something must be done quickly.Slipping out of the
house, he took a look around.Back of the house about a half a mile
distant was a thick piece of wood.A lane led through the fields to this
wood.No doubt it was there that Calhoun's horse was concealed.Fred quickly made up his mind what to do.Mounting his horse, he rode
rapidly away until out of sight of the house; then, making Prince jump
the fence, he rode through the field until he reached the wood, and then
back nearly to the lane he had noticed.Tying his horse, he crept close
to the path, and concealed himself.He soon saw
Calhoun coming up the path with quick, springing steps.To Fred's great
joy he was alone.He let him pass, and then stealthily as an Indian
followed him.Calhoun soon reached the rude stable, and went in."Now, my hearty," said he, as he patted his horse, "we have a long hard
ride before us.But we carry news, my boy--news that may mean
independence to the Sunny South."Strong arms were suddenly thrown around him, and despite his desperate
resistance and struggles, he soon found himself lying on his face, his
hands held behind his back and securely tied.His ankles were then
firmly bound together.When all this was done he was raised to his feet
and a voice said:

"Sorry, Cal, but I had to do it," and to Calhoun's amazement his cousin
stood before him, panting from his exertion.For a moment Calhoun was speechless with astonishment; then his rage
knew no limit, and bound as he was, he tried to get at his cousin."I reckon," said Fred, quietly, "that I must make you more secure," and
taking a stout strap he lashed him securely to a post."Is this the way you keep your oath?"hissed Calhoun, and he spat at
Fred in his contempt."Loose me, you sneaking villain, loose me at once,
or I will raise an alarm, and Mr.Lane and his men will be here, and
they will make short work of you."Just then the notes of a bugle, sweet and clear, came floating through
the air."You had better raise no alarm;
McCook's division is passing, and I have but to say a word and you
swing."Calhoun ground his teeth in impotent rage.At last he asked:

"Fred, what do you want?Have you not sworn to
guard my life as sacredly as your own?"Fred stood looking at his cousin a moment, as if in deep thought; then
an expression of keenest pain came over his face, and he said in a
strained, unnatural voice:

"Calhoun, believe me, I would I were dead instead of standing before you
as I do now.""I should think that you would, if you have a vestige of honor left,"
answered Calhoun, with a sneer."An oath, which an honorable man would
hold more sacred than life itself seems to be lightly regarded by you.""I shall come to that directly," replied Fred, in the same unnatural
tone.To him his voice sounded afar off, as if some one else were
talking."Now, Calhoun, listen; you have a secret, a secret on which the fate of
an army depends."Calhoun, you have been
playing the spy again.do you hear the tramp of McCook's columns.If I did my duty I would cry, 'Here is a spy,' and what then?"Calhoun's face grew ashen; then his natural bravery came to his rescue."I defy you," he exclaimed, his eyes flaming with wrath."Hang me if you
will, and then in the sight of God behold yourself a murderer worse than
Cain.""Calhoun, once more I say, listen.The information that you have you
shall not take to Johnston.What I do now
would hang me instead of you, if Buell knew.But I trust you with more
than life; I trust you with my honor.Give me your sacred word that you
will keep away from Corinth until after Buell and Grant have joined
forces; promise as sacredly that you will not directly or indirectly
divulge in any manner to any person the knowledge you have gained, and I
will release you."Calhoun looked Fred in the face, hesitated, and then slowly answered:
"You seem to think I have more honor and will keep an oath better than
yourself."Calhoun," he cried, "you do not, you cannot mean
it.Promise, for the love of heaven,
promise!""I will not promise, I will die first," replied Calhoun, doggedly.A
faint hope was arising in his mind that Fred was only trying to frighten
him; that he had only to remain firm, and that, at the worst, Fred would
only try to keep him a prisoner.Calhoun's words were to Fred as a sentence of death.He sank on his
knees, and lifted his hands imploringly."Calhoun," he moaned, "see me, see me here at your feet.It is I, not
you, who is to be pitied.For the love we bear each other"--at the word
"love" Calhoun's lips curled in contempt--"for the sake of those near
and dear to us, for the honor of our names, promise, oh, promise me!"See, I spit on you, I despise you, defy
you.""Then you must die," replied Fred, slowly rising to his feet."Fred, you will not give me up to be
hanged?""No, Calhoun, your dishonor would be my dishonor.I cannot keep my oath,
and have you hanged as a spy.""I shall shoot you with my own hand.""You do not, cannot mean
that?""It is the only way I can keep my oath and still prevent you from
carrying the news that would mean destruction to Grant's army."How can you keep your oath by
murdering me?""Calhoun, I swore to consider your honor as sacred as my own, to value
your life as highly as my own, to share with you whatever fate might
come.After I put a bullet through your heart, I
shall put one through my own brain.John travelled to the office._We both must die._"

Calhoun's face seemed frozen with horror.He gasped and tried to speak,
but no words came."Calhoun," continued Fred, in a tone that sounded as a voice from one
dead, "would that you had promised, for it can do no good not to
promise.Now, say your prayers, for in a
moment we both will be standing before our Maker."Fred bowed his head in silent prayer; but Calhoun, with his
horror-stricken face, never took his eyes from off his cousin."Good-bye, Calhoun," said Fred, as he raised his revolver."For God's sake, don't shoot!The words seemed to explode
from Calhoun's lips.[Illustration: "For God's Sake, don't shoot!For a moment Fred stood as motionless as a statue, with the revolver
raised; then the weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and with a low
moan he plunged forward on his face.So long did he lie in a swoon that Calhoun thought he was dead, and
called to him in the most endearing tones.At last there was a slight
quivering of the limbs, then he began to moan; finally he sat up and
looked around as one dazed.Seeing Calhoun, he started, passed his hand
across his brow as if to collect his thoughts, and said, as if in
surprise: "Why, Calhoun----" Then it all came back to him in its terror
and awfulness, and he fell back sick and faint.Rallying, he struggled
to his feet, tottered to Calhoun, and cut the bonds that bound him."It will not do for us to be found here
together."The two boys clasped hands for a moment, then each turned and went his
separate way.When Fred joined Nelson an hour later the general looked at him sharply,
and asked: "What's the matter, Fred?You look ten years
older than you did yesterday.""I am not really sick, but I am not feeling well, General," replied
Fred; "and I believe, with your permission, I will take an ambulance for
the rest of the day.""Do, Fred, do," kindly replied Nelson, and for the rest of the day Fred
rode in an ambulance, where he could be alone with his thoughts.That evening he asked General Nelson when he expected the division would
reach Savannah."By the 5th, if possible, on the 6th anyway," answered the general."Make it the 5th, General; don't let anything stop you; hurry!Nelson looked after him and muttered: "I wonder what's the matter with
the boy; he hasn't appeared himself to-day; but it may be he will be all
right in the morning.I shall take his advice and hurry, anyway."The next day Nelson urged on his men with a fury that caused the air to
be blue with oaths.And it was well that he did, or Shiloh would have
never been reached in time to aid the gallant soldiers of Grant.Buell saw no need of hurrying.He thought it would be a fine thing to
concentrate his whole army at Waynesborough and march into Savannah with
flying colors, showing Grant what a grand army he had.He telegraphed
General Halleck for permission to do so, and the request was readily
granted.In some manner it became known to the Confederate spies that
Buell's army was to halt at Waynesborough, and the glad tidings were
quickly borne to General Johnston, and when that general marched forth
to battle he had no expectation that he would have to meet any of
Buell's men.General Buell hurried forward to stop Nelson at Waynesborough, according
to his plan; but to his chagrin he found that Nelson, in his headlong
haste, was already beyond Waynesborough, and so the plan of stopping him
had to be given up.When General Nelson's advance was a little beyond Waynesborough, a party
engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Savannah to
Nashville was met.A telegram was handed their general, which read:


     TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING BUELL'S ADVANCE:

     There is no need of haste; come on by easy stages.U. S. GRANT,
     Major-General Commanding.Nelson read the telegram, and turning to Fred said:

"This is small comfort for all my hurry.I wonder if I have made a fool
of myself, after all.Buell will have the joke on me, sure.""Better be that way than have you needed and not there," answered Fred."If we are needed and are not there, Grant can only blame himself," was
Nelson's reply.At noon on April 5th Ammen's brigade, the advance of Nelson's division,
marched into Savannah.Colonel Ammen reported his arrival, and said:

"My men are not tired; we can march on to Pittsburg Landing if
necessary."The answer was: "Rest, and make your men comfortable.There will be no
battle at Pittsburg Landing.Boats will be sent for you in a day or
two."There was to be a rude awakening on the morrow."The sun of Austerlitz" was neither brighter nor more glorious than the
sun which arose over the field of Shiloh Sunday morning, April 6, 1862.Around the little log chapel, wont to echo to the voice of prayer and
song of praise, along the hillsides and in the woods, lay encamped the
Federal army.The soldiers had lain down the night before without a
thought of what this bright, sunny Sabbath would bring forth.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.A sense of
security pervaded the whole army.From commander down to private, there
was scarcely a thought of an attack."I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack," wrote Grant to Halleck
on April 5th.On the evening of the same day Sherman wrote to Grant: "I do not
apprehend anything like an attack upon our position."Yet when these words were written the Confederate army was in battle
array not much over three miles distant.But there was one general in the Federal army who was uneasy, he hardly
knew why.He was little known at the time, he never held a
distinguished command afterward; yet it was by his vigilance that the
Federal army was saved from surprise, perhaps from capture.A vague idea that something was wrong haunted him.The
ominous silence in front oppressed him, as something to be feared.An unusual number of squirrels and
rabbits were noticed dodging through the line, and they were all headed
in one direction--toward Pittsburg Landing.To guard more surely against surprise Prentiss posted his pickets a mile
and a half in front of his lines, an unusual distance.At three o'clock
Sunday morning he sent three companies of the Twenty-fifth Missouri out
on a reconnoitering expedition.These three companies followed a road
that obliqued to the right, and a little after daylight met the enemy's
advance in front of Sherman's division.Thus the battle of Shiloh
opened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the
Confederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen
minutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major
Hardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he
fought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general
advance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along
the line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston
Johnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was
fired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along
the whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been
fighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was
startled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily
writing an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his
division up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left
his breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon
steaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of
General Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace
hold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his
chief-of-staff, Grant said:

"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of
raw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are
all right.""It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,"
answered Rawlins."Yes," answered Grant, "but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general
attack."It sounds very much like it," replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all
doubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men
had commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to
come at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem
the tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments
which had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most
needed.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his
generals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and
all would be well.Some of his regiments
had broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of
danger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,
pleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be
careful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: "If
I can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it."Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: "General, I did not
expect this; forgive me.""I am your senior general," answered Sherman."You depended on me for
reports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an
attack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by
my side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward."There is nothing to forgive," he said, gently."The mistake is mine as well as yours.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will
soon be here, and we will whip them; never fear."By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond
his camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.
Wallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the
field was afterward known as the "Hornet's Nest."Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told
them to hold it to the last man."We will," responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat
against them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and
bleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army
were bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken
soldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:
"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry."Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the
Union lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised
Johnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments
had been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus
gain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time
hurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to
charge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and
said: "I will lead you, my children."With wild cheers his men pressed forward;
nothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was
crushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate
army stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died
away, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the
respite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to
pieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of
General Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With
anxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the
first fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer
reports: "Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further
from the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead
of hurrying forward left in front.Then he
is marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face."He
countermarched; coming slow," he said, as if to himself, "Great God,
what does he mean?"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: "Plant the siege guns around the
Landing.See that you have every available piece of artillery in
position."And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between
Grant's army and utter rout."Have you any way of retreat mapped out?"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,
viewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of
demoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: "Retreat!I
have not yet despaired of victory."Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from
the center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'
divisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and
Prentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten
o'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their
lines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung
every time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every
side.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he
was cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than
Wallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were
doomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last
stand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides
up to him."General," he says, "Sherman reports that he has taken his last
position.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what
stragglers he has gathered."Go back," quietly said Grant, "and tell Sherman to hold if possible;
night is most here."McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had
furnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now
an orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,
came spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:

"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most
gallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable
reason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the
Landing.""Go tell McClernand," said Grant, "that he has done well, but he must
hold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up."General," he said, in a broken voice, "my division is gone, the whole
left is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.""General," replied Grant, without a quiver, "rally what broken regiments
and stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on
McClernand, and hold your position to the last man."Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and
soldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Daniel moved to the office.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there.""The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."A great
wave of faintness encompassed her.She had
lightly encouraged a departure from the blessings and principles of
total abstinence.That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned apology to her
Maker for the sin of intemperance into which she had been so
unwittingly betrayed.She promised Him that she would never drink
anything that came out of a bottle again.She reviewed sorrowfully her
many arguments with Albertina--Albertina in the flesh that is--on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided that again that
virtuous child was right in her condemnation of any drink, however
harmless in appearance or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of a
bottled label.She knew, however, that something more than a prayer for forgiveness
was required of her.She was pledged to protest against the evil that
she had seemingly countenanced.She could not seek the sleep of the
innocent until that reparation was made.Through the crack of her
sagging door she saw the light from Jimmie's reading lamp and knew
that he was still dressed, or clothed at least, with a sufficient
regard for the conventionalities to permit her intrusion.She rose and
rebraided her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it.Then she put on
her stockings and her blue Japanese kimono--real Japanese, as Aunt
Beulah explained, made for a Japanese lady of quality--and made her
way into the studio.Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable studio chair with his
book under the light and his feet on the bamboo tea table as usual.He was flung on the couch with his face
buried in the cushions, and his shoulders were shaking.Eleanor seeing
him thus, forgot her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence, forgot
everything but the pitiful spectacle of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in
grief.She stood looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort."Uncle Jimmie," she said, "Uncle Jimmie."At the sound of her voice he put out his hand to her, gropingly, but
he did not uncover his face or shift his position.She found herself
smoothing his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and more
conviction as he snuggled his boyish head closer."I'm awfully discouraged," he said in a weak muffled voice."I'm sorry
you caught me at it, Baby."Eleanor put her face down close to his as he turned it to her."Everything will be all right," she promised him, "everything will be
all right.You'll soon get a job--tomorrow maybe."Then she gathered him close in her angular, tense little arms and held
him there tightly."Everything will be all right," she repeated
soothingly; "now you just put your head here, and have your cry out."CHAPTER VIII

THE TEN HUTCHINSONS


"My Aunt Margaret has a great many people living in her family,"
Eleanor wrote to Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights."She has a mother and a father, and two (2) grandparents, one
(1) aunt, one (1) brother, one (1) married lady and the boy of the
lady, I think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask any one,
oh--and another brother, who does not live here only on Saturdays and
Sundays.Aunt Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait on the
table.I guess you have read about them in
stories.I am taken right in to be one of the family, and I have a
good time every day now.Aunt Margaret's father is a college teacher,
and Aunt Margaret's grandfather looks like the father of his country.They have a piano here that
plays itself like a sewing machine.They have
after-dinner coffee and gold spoons to it.I guess you would like to
see a gold spoon.They are about the size of the tin spoons we
had in our playhouse.I have a lot of fun with that boy too.At first
I thought he was very affected, but that is just the way they teach
him to talk.He is nine and plays tricks on other people.He dares me
to do things that I don't do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar.If
Aunt Margaret's mother was my grandma I might steal sugar or plum
cake.Remember the time we took your mother's hermits?You would think this house was quite a
grand house.It has three (3) flights of stairs and one basement.I
sleep on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt Margaret's only
it isn't a dressing room.Aunt
Margaret is pretty and sings lovely.*       *       *       *       *

In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate facts of her new
existence, such facts as she instinctively guarded from Albertina's
calculating sense.*       *       *       *       *

"Everybody makes fun of me here.I don't care if they do, but I can't
eat so much at the table when every one is laughing at me.They get
me to talking and then they laugh.If I could see anything to laugh
at, I would laugh too.They laugh in a refined way but they laugh.They say to
my face that I am like a merry wilkins story and too good to be true,
and New England projuces lots of real art, and I am art, I can't
remember all the things, but I guess they mean well.Aunt Margaret's
grandfather sits at the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before.He knows the govoner and does not like the way
he parts his hair.I thought all govoners did what they wanted to with
their hairs or anything and people had to like it because (I used to
spell because wrong but I spell better now) they was the govoners, but
it seems not at all.I meant to like
Aunt Beulah the best because she has done the most for me but I am
afrayd I don't.I would not cross my heart and say so.Aunt Margaret
gives me the lessons now.I guess I learn most as much as I learned I
mean was taught of Aunt Beulah.Oh dear sometimes I get descouraged
on account of its being such a funny world and so many diferent people
in it.I was afrayd of the hired
butler, but I am not now."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor had not made a direct change from the Washington Square studio
to the ample house of the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that
a change in Jimmie's fortunes had taken her back to the Winchester and
enabled her to accustom herself again to the amenities of gentler
living.Like all sensitive and impressionable children she took on the
color of a new environment very quickly.The strain of her studio
experience had left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but she
had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful surroundings of
the Winchester and under the influence of Jimmie's restored spirits.The change had come about on Jimmie's "last day of grace."He had
secured the coveted position at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.He had left Eleanor
in the morning determined to face becomingly the disappointment that
was in store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of admitting
his failure to his friends.He had come back in the late afternoon
with his fortunes restored, the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and inspired footing.He had burst into the studio with his news before he understood that
Eleanor was not alone, and inadvertently shared the secret with
Gertrude, who had been waiting for him with the kettle alight and some
wonderful cakes from "Henri's" spread out on the tea table.The three
had celebrated by dining together at a festive down-town hotel and
going back to his studio for coffee.At parting they had solemnly and
severally kissed one another.Eleanor lay awake in the dark for a long
time that night softly rubbing the cheek that had been so caressed,
and rejoicing that the drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and
had pledged their health with so assiduously, had come out of two
glasses instead of a bottle.Her life at the Hutchinsons' was almost like a life on another planet.Margaret was the younger, somewhat delicate daughter of a family of
rather strident academics.Professor Hutchinson was not dependent on
his salary to defray the expenses of his elegant establishment, but
on his father, who had inherited from his father in turn the
substantial fortune on which the family was founded.Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but she was considerably
more fortunate in her choice of a foster family than is usually the
fate of the foundling.The rigorous altitude of intellect in which she
was reared served as a corrective to the oversensitive quality of her
imagination.Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of her life was given to
visitations from the poetic muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines
to her on one of the pink pages of the private diary.They ran as
follows, and even Professor Hutchinson, who occupied the chair of
English in that urban community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated Eleanor's
description of his daughter as one that did not describe."Aunt Margaret is fair and kind,
                  And very good and tender."She moves around the room with grace,
                  Her hands she puts with quickness.Although she wears upon her face
                  The shadow of a sickness."It was this "shadow of a sickness," that served to segregate Margaret
to the extent that was really necessary for her well being.To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities of the family
might have forever dulled that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came
to owe so much in the various stages of her development.Margaret put her arm about the child after the ordeal of the first
dinner at the big table."Father does not bite," she said, "but Grandfather does.If Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your
life.""I don't know where to run to," Eleanor answered seriously, whereupon
Margaret hugged her.Her Aunt Margaret would have been puzzling to
Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication, but for the quick imagination
that unwound her riddles almost as she presented them.For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh Hutchinson senior did
bite, he looked so much like some of the worst of the pictures in
Little Red Riding Hood."While you are here I'm going to pretend you're my very own child,"
Margaret told Eleanor that first evening, "and we'll never, never tell
anybody all the foolish games we play and the things we say to each
other.I can just barely manage to be grown up in the bosom of my
family, and when I am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah, but
up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown up.She opened a funny old chest in the
corner of the spacious, high studded chamber."And here are some of
the dolls that I play with."She produced a manikin dressed primly
after the manner of eighteen-thirty, prim parted hair over a small
head festooned with ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her
fingers."Beulah," she said with a mischievous flash of a grimace at
Eleanor."Gertrude,"--a dashing young brunette in riding clothes."Jimmie,"--a curly haired dandy."David,"--a serious creature with a
monocle."I couldn't find Peter," she said, "but we'll make him some
day out of cotton and water colors."Eleanor cried in delight, "real dolls with
hair and different  eyes?""I can make pretty good ones," Margaret smiled; "manikins like
these,--a Frenchwoman taught me."And do you play that the dolls talk to each other as if
they was--were the persons?"Margaret assembled the four manikins into a smart little
group.The doll Beulah rose,--on her forefinger."I can't help
feeling," mimicked Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah's
earnest contralto, "that we're wasting our lives,--criminally
dissipating our forces."The doll Gertrude put up both hands."I want to laugh," she cried,
"won't everybody please stop talking till I've had my laugh out."Why, that's just like Aunt Gertrude," Eleanor said."Her voice has
that kind of a sound like a bell, only more ripply.""Don't be high-brow," Jimmie's lazy baritone besought with the slight
burring of the "r's" that Eleanor found so irresistible."I'm only a
poor hard-working, business man.""We intend to devote the
rest of our lives," he said, "to the care of our beloved cooperative
orphan."On that he made a rather over mannered exit, Margaret
planting each foot down deliberately until she flung him back in his
box."That's the kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is," she
continued, "but you mustn't ever tell anybody, Eleanor."She clasped
the child again in one of her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor
squeezing her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with her new
existence."But there isn't any doll for _you_, Aunt Margaret," she cried.yes, there is, but I wasn't going to show her to you unless you
asked, because she's so nice.I saved the prettiest one of all to be
myself, not because I believe I'm so beautiful, but--but only because
I'd like to be, Eleanor.""I always pretend I'm a princess," Eleanor admitted.The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful creation, a little more
like Marie Antoinette than her namesake, but bearing a not
inconsiderable resemblance to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night after this.In the
daytime she looked rather battered and ugly to eyes accustomed to the
delicate finish of creatures like the French manikins, but after she
was tucked away in her cot in the passion flower dressing-room--all of
Margaret's belongings and decorations were a faint, pinky
lavender,--her dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated Albertina at
increasingly rare intervals as time advanced, lay in the hollow of her
arm and received her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.*       *       *       *       *

"When my two (2) months are up here I think I should be quite sorry,"
she wrote in the diary, "except that I'm going to Uncle Peter next,
and him I would lay me down and dee for, only I never get time enough
to see him, and know if he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know.Well life is very exciting all the time now.Aunt Margaret
brings me up this way.She tells me that she loves me and that I've
got beautiful eyes and hair and am sweet.She says she wants to love me up enough to last because I never
had love enough before.Albertina never loves any
one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody--not to say so anyway.If a
man is getting married they say he _likes_ that girl he is going to
marry.In New York they act as different as they eat.The Hutchinsons
act different from anybody.They do not know Aunt Margaret has adoptid
me.Nobody knows I am adoptid but me and my aunts and uncles.Miss
Prentis and Aunt Beulah's mother when she came home and all the
bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons think I am a little
visiting girl from the country.It is nobody's business because I am
supported out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me feel queer
sometimes.I feel like

                "'Where did you come from, baby dear,
                Out of the nowhere unto the here?'Also I made this up out of home sweet home."'Pleasures and palaces where e'er I may roam,
            Be it ever so humble I wish I had a home.'"I like having six homes, but I wish everybody knew it.Speaking of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my aunts
and uncles did not marry each other and make it easier for every one.She said they were not going to get married.'Am I the same thing as getting married?'She said no, I
wasn't except that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish and
real.Aunt Beulah doesn't believe in marriage.Aunt Margaret doesn't think she has the health.Aunt Gertrude has
to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has got to marry some one
his mother says to or not at all, and does not like to marry anyway.Uncle Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks you have a beter
time in single blesedness.Uncle Peter did not sign in the book where
they said they would adopt me and not marry.They did not want to ask
him because he had some trouble once.Well I am
going to be married sometime.I want a house to do the housework in
and a husband and a backyard full of babies.Perhaps I would rather
have a hired butler and gold spoons.Of course I
would like to have time to write poetry.I can sculpture too, but I
don't want a career of it because it's so dirty."*       *       *       *       *

Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during this phase of her
existence.The nourishing food and regular living, the sympathy
established between herself and Margaret, the regime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been obliged guiltily to
disregard during the strenuous days of her existence in Washington
Square, all contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being.She played with Margaret's nephew, and ran up and down
stairs on errands for her mother.She listened to the tales related
for her benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the attentions
of the two formidable young men of the family, who entertained her
with the pianola and excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.*       *       *       *       *

"The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday afternoon," she wrote--on a
yellow page this time--"usually at Aunt Beulah's house.I am examined on what I have learned but I don't mind
it much.Physically I am found to be very good by measure and waite.I am very bright on the subject of
poetry.They do not know whether David Copperfield had been a wise
choice for me, but when I told them the story and talked about it they
said I had took it right.I don't tell them about the love part of
Aunt Margaret's bringing up.Aunt Beulah says it would make me self
conscioush to know that I had such pretty eyes and hair.Aunt Gertrude
said 'why not mention my teeth to me, then,' but no one seemed to
think so.Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because the
theory is to strengthen the weak part of the bridge, and make me do
arithmetic.'Drill on the deficiency,' she says.Well I should think
the love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks love is weak
and beneath her and any one.Uncle David told me privately that he
thought I was having the best that could happen to me right now being
with Aunt Margaret.I didn't tell him that the David doll always gets
put away in the box with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have.*       *       *       *       *

Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful scene in which she
had participated.*       *       *       *       *

"I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons.They laughed
at me too much for being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at Aunt Margaret for
adopting me and the tears came in her eyes I could not bare it.I did
not let the cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out.The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to Cape Cod, and I said I
hoped never, and then I said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next.They said 'Uncle David--do you mean
David Bolling?'and I did, so I said 'yes.'Then all the Hutchinsons
pitched into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying, 'Who is this
mysterious child anyway, and how is it that her guardians intrust her
to a crowd of scatter brain youngsters for so long?'and then they
said 'Uncle David Bolling--_what_ does his mother say?'Then Aunt
Margaret got very red in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said 'I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle David is as much my
Uncle David as they all are,' and then I said 'My Aunt Margaret has
got a perfect right to have me intrusted to her at any time, and not
to be laughed at for it,' and I went and stood in front of her and
gave her my handkercheve."Well I am glad somebody has been told that I am properly adoptid, but
I am sorry it is the ten Hutchinsons who know."CHAPTER IX

PETER


Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown up; that was the
wonderful thing about her visit to him,--if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another.From the moment when he ushered
her into his friendly, low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon
tiers of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of equality to the
miraculous order of existence that it was the privilege of her life to
share.The pink silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah's; the implacable British stuffiness at the
Winchester which had had its own stolid charm for the lineal
descendant of the Pilgrim fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the "hired butler" presided distributing after-dinner gold
spoons, these impressions all dwindled and diminished and took their
insignificant place in the background of the romance she was living
and breathing in Peter's jewel box of an apartment on Thirtieth
Street.Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor's the place seemed to be
a realized ideal of charm and homeliness.It was one of the older
fashioned duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic decade for
a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently adapted to the modern
insistence on technical convenience.Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased it and settled it and
suddenly departed for a five years' residence in China with her
husband, who was as she so often described him, "a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker."Peter's domestic affairs were
despatched by a large, motherly Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of
on sight and later came to respect and adore without reservation.Peter's home was a home with a place in it for her--a place that it
was perfectly evident was better with her than without her.She even
slept in the bed that Peter's sister's little girl had occupied, and
there were pictures on the walls that had been selected for her.She had been very glad to make her escape from the Hutchinson
household.Her "quarrel" with them had made no difference in their
relation to her.To her surprise they treated her with an increase of
deference after her outburst, and every member of the family,
excepting possibly Hugh Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully
polite to her.Margaret explained that the family really didn't mind
having their daughter a party to the experiment of cooperative
parenthood.It appealed to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories of the independence
of the individual modified their criticism of Margaret's secrecy in
the matter, which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from the estate of the aunt
for whom she had been named."It is very silly of me to be sensitive about being laughed at,"
Margaret concluded."I've lived all my life surrounded by people
suffering from an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for things that are not
funny to me.""I shouldn't think you would," Eleanor answered devoutly.In Peter's house there was no one to laugh at her but Peter, and when
Peter laughed she considered it a triumph.It meant that there was
something she said that he liked.The welcome she had received as a
guest in his house and the wonderful evening that succeeded it were
among the epoch making hours in Eleanor's life.The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother Hutchinson still clung to the
old-time, stately method of getting about the streets of New York, had
left her at Peter's door at six o'clock of a keen, cool May evening.Margaret had not been well enough to come with her, having been
prostrated by one of the headaches of which she was a frequent
victim.The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved and paneled, with its
mammoth brass knocker, the row of window boxes along the cornice a few
feet above it, the very look of the house was an experience and an
adventure to her.When she rang, the door opened almost instantly
revealing Peter on the threshold with his arms open.He had led her up
two short flights of stairs--ivory white with carved banisters, she
noticed, all as immaculately shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod
interior--to his own gracious drawing-room where Mrs.Finnigan was
bowing and smiling a warmhearted Irish welcome to her.It was like a
wonderful story in a book and her eyes were shining with joy as Uncle
Peter pulled out her chair and she sat down to the first meal in her
honor.The grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave air with
which Peter consulted her tastes and her preferences were all a part
of a beautiful magic that had never quite touched her before.She had been like a little girl in a dream passing dutifully or
delightedly through the required phases of her experience, never quite
believing in its permanence or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own.That was what she felt the moment
she stepped over his threshold.After their coffee before the open fire--she herself had had "cambric"
coffee--Peter smoked his cigar, while she curled up in silence in the
twin to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.The blue
flames skimmed the bed of black coals, and finally settled steadily at
work on them nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was like a
basket full of molten light, glowing and golden as the hot sun when it
sinks into the sea.Except to offer her the ring about his slender Panatela, and to ask
her if she were happy, Peter did not speak until he had deliberately
crushed out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into the fire.The ceremony over, he held out his arms to her and she slipped into
them as if that moment were the one she had been waiting for ever
since the white morning looked into the window of the lavender
dressing-room on Morningside Heights, and found her awake and quite
cold with the excitement of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth."Eleanor," Peter said, when he was sure she was comfortably arranged
with her head on his shoulder, "Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn't any other home,
and you and I belonged to each other.I'm almost too young to be your
father, but--"

"Oh!Eleanor asked fervently, as he paused.

"--But I can come pretty near feeling like a father to you if it's a
father you want.I lost my own father when I was a little older than
you are now, but I had my dear mother and sister left, and so I don't
know what it's like to be all alone in the world, and I can't always
understand exactly how you feel, but you must always remember that I
want to understand and that I will understand if you tell me."Yes, Uncle Peter," she said soberly; then perhaps for the first time
since her babyhood she volunteered a caress that was not purely
maternal in its nature.She put up a shy hand to the cheek so close to
her own and patted it earnestly."Of course I've got my grandfather
and grandmother," she argued, "but they're very old, and not very
affectionate, either.Then I have all these new aunts and uncles
pretending," she was penetrating to the core of the matter, Peter
realized, "that they're just as good as parents.Of course, they're
just as good as they can be and they take so much trouble that it
mortifies me, but it isn't just the same thing, Uncle Peter!""I know," Peter said, "I know, dear, but you must remember we mean
well.""I don't mean you; it isn't you that I think of when I think about my
co--co-woperative parents, and it isn't any of them specially,--it's
just the idea of--of visiting around, and being laughed at, and not
really belonging to anybody.""That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle Peter," she whispered.They had a long talk after this, discussing the past and the future;
the past few months of the experiment from Eleanor's point of view,
and the future in relation to its failures and successes.Beulah was
to begin giving her lessons again and she was to take up music with a
visiting teacher on Peter's piano.(Eleanor had not known it was a
piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand before.Peter did
not know what a triumph it was when she made herself put the question
to him.)"If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much as she does and make it as
interesting as Aunt Margaret does, I think I would make her feel very
proud of me," Eleanor said."I get so nervous saving energy the way
Aunt Beulah says for me to that I forget all the lesson.Aunt Margaret
tells too many stories, I guess, but I like them.""Your Aunt Margaret is a child of God," Peter said devoutly, "in spite
of her raw-boned, intellectual family.""Uncle David says she's a daughter of the fairies."When Margaret's a year or two older you won't feel
the need of a mother.""I don't now," said Eleanor; "only a father,--that I want you to be,
the way you promised."Then he continued musingly, "You'll find
Gertrude--different.I can't quite imagine her presiding over your
moral welfare but I think she'll be good at it.She's a good deal of a
person, you know.""Aunt Beulah's a good kind of person, too," Eleanor said; "she tries
hard.The only thing is that she keeps trying to make me express
myself, and I don't know what that means.""Let me see if I can tell you," said Peter."Self-expression is a part
of every man's duty.Inside we are all trying to be good and true and
fine--"

"Except the villains," Eleanor interposed."People like Iago aren't
trying.""Well, we'll make an exception of the villains; we're talking of
people like us, pretty good people with the right instincts.Well
then, if all the time we're trying to be good and true and fine, we
carry about a blank face that reflects nothing of what we are feeling
and thinking, the world is a little worse off, a little duller and
heavier place for what is going on inside of us.""Well, how can we make it better off then?""By not thinking too much about it for one thing, except to remember
to smile, by trying to be just as much at home in it as possible, by
letting the kind of person we are trying to be show through on the
outside."By just not being bashful, do you mean?""Well, when Aunt Beulah makes me do those dancing exercises, standing
up in the middle of the floor and telling me to be a flower and
express myself as a flower, does she just mean not to be bashful?""Something like that: she means stop thinking of yourself and go
ahead--"

"But how can I go ahead with her sitting there watching?""I suppose I ought to tell you to imagine that you had the soul of a
flower, but I haven't the nerve.""You've got nerve enough to do anything," Eleanor assured him, but she
meant it admiringly, and seriously."I haven't the nerve to go on with a moral conversation in which you
are getting the better of me at every turn," Peter laughed."I'm sure
it's unintentional, but you make me feel like a good deal of an ass,
Eleanor.""That means a donkey, doesn't it?""It does, and by jove, I believe that you're glad of it.""I do rather like it," said Eleanor; "of course you don't really feel
like a donkey to me.I mean I don't make you feel like one, but it's
funny just pretending that you mean it.""Beulah tried to convey something of
the fact that you always got the better of every one in your modest
unassuming way, but I never quite believed it before.At any rate it's
bedtime, and here comes Mrs.Kiss me good
night, sweetheart."Eleanor flung her arms about his neck, in her first moment of
abandonment to actual emotional self-expression if Peter had only
known it."I will never really get the better of you in my life, Uncle Peter,"
she promised him passionately.CHAPTER X

THE OMNISCIENT FOCUS


One of the traditional prerogatives of an Omnipotent Power is to look
down at the activities of earth at any given moment and ascertain
simultaneously the occupation of any number of people.Thus the Arch
Creator--that Being of the Supreme Artistic Consciousness--is able to
peer into segregated interiors at His own discretion and watch the
plot thicken and the drama develop.Eleanor, who often visualized this
proceeding, always imagined a huge finger projecting into space,
cautiously tilting the roofs of the Houses of Man to allow the sweep
of the Invisible Glance.Granting the hypothesis of the Divine privilege, and assuming for the
purposes of this narrative the Omniscient focus on the characters most
concerned in it, let us for the time being look over the shoulder of
God and inform ourselves of their various occupations and
preoccupations of a Saturday afternoon in late June during the hour
before dinner.Eleanor, in her little white chamber on Thirtieth Street, was engaged
in making a pink and green toothbrush case for a going-away gift for
her Uncle Peter.To be sure she was going away with him when he
started for the Long Island beach hotel from which he proposed to
return every day to his office in the city, but she felt that a slight
token of her affection would be fitting and proper on the eve of their
joint departure.She was hurrying to get it done that she might steal
softly into the dining-room and put it on his plate undetected.Her
eyes were very wide, her brow intent and serious, and her delicate
lips lightly parted.At that moment she bore a striking resemblance to
the Botticelli head in Beulah's drawing-room that she had so greatly
admired.Of all the people concerned in her history, she was the most
tranquilly occupied.Peter in the room beyond was packing his trunk and his suit-case.At
this precise stage of his proceedings he was trying to make two
decisions, equally difficult, but concerned with widely different
departments of his consciousness.He was gravely considering whether
or not to include among his effects the photograph before him on the
dressing-table--that of the girl to whom he had been engaged from the
time he was a Princeton sophomore until her death four years
later--and also whether or not it would be worth his while to order a
new suit of white flannels so late in the season.The fact that he
finally decided against the photograph and in favor of the white
flannels has nothing to do with the relative importance of the two
matters thus engrossing him.The health of the human mind depends
largely on its ability to assemble its irrelevant and incongruous
problems in dignified yet informal proximity.When he went to his desk
it was with the double intention of addressing a letter to his tailor,
and locking the cherished photograph in a drawer; but, the letter
finished, he still held the picture in his hand and gazed down at it
mutely and when the discreet knock on his door that constituted the
announcing of dinner came, he was still sitting motionless with the
photograph propped up before him.Up-town, Beulah, whose dinner hour came late, was rather more
actively, though possibly not more significantly, occupied.She was
doing her best to evade the wild onslaught of a young man in glasses
who had been wanting to marry her for a considerable period, and had
now broken all bounds in a cumulative attempt to inform her of the
fact.Though he was assuredly in no condition to listen to reason, Beulah
was reasoning with him, kindly and philosophically, paying earnest
attention to the style and structure of her remarks as she did so.Her
emotions, as is usual on such occasions, were decidedly mixed.She was
conscious of a very real dismay at her unresponsiveness, a distress
for the acute pain from which the distraught young man seemed to be
suffering, and the thrill, which had she only known it, is the
unfailing accompaniment to the first eligible proposal of marriage.In
the back of her brain there was also, so strangely is the human mind
constituted, a kind of relief at being able to use mature logic once
more, instead of the dilute form of moral dissertation with which she
tried to adapt herself to Eleanor's understanding."I never intend to marry any one," she was explaining gently."I not
only never intend to, but I am pledged in a way that I consider
irrevocably binding never to marry,"--and that was the text from which
all the rest of her discourse developed.Jimmie, equally bound by the oath of celibacy, but not equally
constrained by it apparently, was at the very moment when Beulah was
so successfully repulsing the familiarity of the high cheek-boned
young man in the black and white striped tie, occupied in encouraging
a familiarity of a like nature.That is, he was holding the hand of a
young woman in the darkened corner of a drawing-room which had been
entirely unfamiliar to him ten days before, and was about to impress a
caress on lips that seemed to be ready to meet his with a certain
degree of accustomed responsiveness.That this was not a peculiarly
significant incident in Jimmie's career might have been difficult to
explain, at least to the feminine portion of the group of friends he
cared most for.Margaret, dressed for an academic dinner party, in white net with a
girdle of pale pink and lavender ribbons, had flung herself face
downward on her bed in reckless disregard of her finery; and because
it was hot and she was homesick for green fields and the cool
stretches of dim wooded country, had transported herself in fancy and
still in her recumbent attitude to the floor of a canoe that was
drifting down-stream between lush banks of meadow grass studded with
marsh lilies.After some interval--and shift of position--the way was
arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars came out one by one,
showing faintly between waving branches; and she perceived dimly that
a figure that was vaguely compounded of David and Peter and the
handsomest of all the young kings of Spain, had quietly taken its
place in the bow and had busied itself with the paddles,--whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons and their guests
were awaiting her.David, the only member of the group whose summer vacation had actually
begun, was sitting on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York and looking soberly into
the eyes of a blue ribbon bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his
knees.His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions of the
season's foulards, sleekly corseted and coifed, was sitting less than
a hundred yards away from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David.In the dressing-room above,
just alighted from a limousine de luxe, was a raven-haired,
crafty-eyed ingenue (whose presence David did not suspect or he would
have recollected a sudden pressing engagement out of her vicinity),
preening herself for conquest.David's mind, unlike the minds of the
"other gifted members of the We Are Seven Club," to quote Jimmie's
most frequent way of referring to them, was to all intents and
purposes a total blank.He answered monosyllabically his mother's
questions, patted the dog's beetling forehead and thought of nothing
at all for practically forty-five minutes.Then he rose, and offering
his arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved for him in
the dining-room.Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house in Fifty-sixth Street
where she lived with her parents, was putting the finishing touches on
a faun's head; and a little because she had unconsciously used
Jimmie's head for her model, and a little because of her conscious
realization at this moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody's in the world but Jimmie's, she was thinking of
him seriously.She was thinking also of the dinner on a tray that
would presently be brought up to her, since her mother and father were
out of town, and of her coming two months with Eleanor and her recent
inspiration concerning them.In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner hour and even the
supper hour were long past.In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor's
former home two old people were sitting in calico valanced rockers,
one by either window.The house was a pleasant old colonial structure,
now badly run down but still marked with that distinction that only
the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon a decaying habitation.A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing out unnecessarily,
and let herself in by the back door without knocking.Amos," she said, seating herself in a
straight backed, yellow chair, and swinging her crossed foot
nonchalantly, "I thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.Ma
said that she heard that she was coming home to live again.Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of Eleanor's grandfather.Amos
Chase had ideas of his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.Also Albertina's father
had come from "poor stock."There was a strain of bad blood in her.The women of the Weston families hadn't always "behaved themselves."He therefore answered this representative of the youngest generation
rather shortly."I don't know nothing about it," he said."Why, father," the querulous old voice of Grandmother Chase protested,
"you know she's comin' home somewhere 'bout the end of July, she and
one of her new aunties and a hired girl they're bringing along to do
the work.I don't see why you can't answer the child's question.""I don't know as I'm obligated to answer any questions that anybody
sees fit to put to me."Albertina, pass me my glasses from off the
mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking out from behind the clock
and I'll read what she says."Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr.Amos, who retired coughing
exasperatedly behind a paper that he did not read, allowed herself to
be informed through the medium of a letter from Gertrude and a
postscript from Eleanor of the projected invasion of the Chase
household."I should think you'd rather have Eleanor come home by herself than
bringing a strange woman and a hired girl," Albertina contributed a
trifle tartly.The distinction of a hired girl in the family was one
which she had long craved on her own account."All nonsense, I call it," the old man ejaculated."Well, Eleena, she writes that she can't get away without one of 'em
comin' along with her and I guess we can manage someways.I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen.You can't expect much from
city help.I shall certainly be
dretful pleased to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa--in spite o'
the way he goes on about it."A snort came from the region of the newspaper."I shouldn't think you'd feel as if you had a grandchild now that six
rich people has adopted her," Albertina suggested helpfully."It's a good thing for the child," her grandmother said."I'm so lame
I couldn't do my duty by her.Old folks is old folks, and they can't
do for others like young ones.I'd d'ruther have had her adopted by
one father and mother instead o' this passel o' young folks passing
her around among themselves, but you can't have what you'd d'ruther
have in this world.You got to take what comes and be thankful.""Did she write you about having gold coffee spoons at her last place?""I think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn't know the difference.I guess she has got a lot
of new clothes.Well, I'll have to be getting along.At the precise moment that the door closed behind Albertina, the clock
in Peter Stuyvesant's apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped into her chair at the
dinner table and waited with eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to
make the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.CHAPTER XI

GERTRUDE HAS TROUBLE WITH HER BEHAVIOR


"Dear Uncle Peter," Eleanor wrote from Colhassett when she had been
established there under the new regime for a week or more.I am very awfully sorry, but I could not help it.Don't tell Aunt Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary to the golden rule
that I was.She said
Aunt Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the hired girl was
homely too.Well, I think she is, but I am not going to have Albertina
think so.Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and ink like
hair and lovely teeth and one dimple.Albertina likes hair fuzzed all
over faces and blonds.Then she said she guessed I wasn't your
favorite, and that the gold spoons were most likely tin gilded over.I
don't know what you think about slapping.Will you please write and
say what you think?You know I am anxsuch to do well.But I think I
know as much as Albertina about some things.She uster treat me like a
dog, but it is most a year now since I saw her before."Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.Grandpa did not like
her at first.She looked so much like summer folks, and acted that
way, too.He does not agree with summer folks, but she got him talking
about foreign parts and that Spanish girl that made eyes at him, and
nearly got him away from Grandma, and the time they were wrecked going
around the horn, and showing her dishes and carvings from China.Grandma likes her
too, but not when Grandpa tells her about that girl in Spain."We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely food, only Grandpa does
not like it, but we have him a pie now for breakfast,--his own pie
that he can eat from all the time and he feels better.Aunt Gertrude
is happy seeing him eat it for breakfast and claps her hands when he
does it, only he doesn't see her."She is teaching me more manners, and to swim, and some French.It is
vacation and I don't have regular lessons, the way I did while we
were on Long Island."Didn't we have a good time in that hotel?Do you remember the night I
stayed up till ten o'clock and we sat on the beach and talked?I would miss you more if I believed what Albertina said about my
not being your favorite.Uncle Jimmie is coming and then I
don't know what Albertina will say.Mary went to the office.Aunt Gertrude's idea of getting me cultivated is
to read to me from the great Masters of literature and funny books
too, like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology.Then I say what I think
of them, and she just lets me develop along those lines, which is
pretty good for summer."The sun and wind are on the sea,
                  The waves are clear and blue,
                This is the place I like to be,
                  If I could just have you."The insects chirrup in the grass,
                  The birds sing in the tree,
                And oh!Sandra went to the office.how quick the time would pass
                  If you were here with me.""What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?"Eleanor asked one
evening when they were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway, and the early moon had
illumined for them."Do you think it's awfully bad to slap any one?""I wouldn't slap you, if that's what you mean, Eleanor.""Would you slap somebody your own size and a little bigger?""I thought perhaps you would," Eleanor sighed with a gasp of relieved
satisfaction."I don't believe in moral suasion entirely, Eleanor," Gertrude tried
to follow Eleanor's leads, until she had in some way satisfied the
child's need for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.It was
not always simple to discover just what Eleanor wanted to know, but
Gertrude had come to believe that there was always some excellent
reason for her wanting to know it."I think there are some quarrels
that have to be settled by physical violence.""I want to bring
myself up good when--when all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don't know.I want to grow up, and be ladylike and a credit, and I'm
getting such good culture that I think I ought to, but--I get worried
about my refinement.City refinement is different from country
refinement.""Refinement isn't a thing that you can worry about," Gertrude began
slowly.She realized perhaps better than any of the others, being a
better balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or Margaret,
that there were serious defects in the scheme of cooperative
parentage.Eleanor, thanks to the overconscientious digging about her
roots, was acquiring a New England self-consciousness about her
processes.A child, Gertrude felt, should be handed a code ready made
and should be guided by it without question until his maturer
experience led him to modify it.The trouble with trying to explain
this to Eleanor was that she had already had too many things
explained to her, and the doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be
inculcated by an exploitation of it."If you are naturally a fine
person your instinct will be to do the fine thing.You must follow it
when you feel the instinct and not think about it between times.""That's Uncle Peter's idea," Eleanor said, "that not thinking.Well,
I'll try--but you and Uncle Peter didn't have six different parents
and a Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing your
refinement in different ways.Don't you ever have any trouble with
your behavior, Aunt Gertrude?"The truth was that she was having considerable
trouble with her behavior since Jimmie's arrival two days before.She
had thought to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod helping
the child to relate her new environment to her old, while she had the
benefit of her native air and the freedom of a rural summer.She also
felt that one of their number ought to have a working knowledge of
Eleanor's early surroundings and habits.She had meant to put herself
and her own concerns entirely aside.If she had a thought for any one
but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two old people whose guest she
had constituted herself.She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two
before her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested that he
spend his own two vacation weeks watching the progress of her
experiment.Before she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him to
do so she had given him permission to come.Jimmie was part of her
trouble.Her craving for isolation and undiscovered country; her
eagerness to escape with her charge to some spot where she would not
be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance, were all a part of
an instinct to segregate herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it.This she realized as soon as
he arrived on the spot.She realized further that she had made
practically no progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude had decided a young
man should be, was rapidly becoming a serious menace to her peace of
mind, and her ideal of a future lived for art alone.She had
definitely begun to realize this on the night when Jimmie, in his
exuberance at securing his new job, had seized her about the waist and
kissed her on the lips.She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
which came dangerously near being her first one.She was too clever,
too cool and aloof, to have had many tentative love-affairs.Later, as
she softened and warmed and gathered grace with the years she was
likely to seem more alluring and approachable to the gregarious male.Now she answered her small interlocutor truthfully."Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble with my behavior.I'm
having trouble with it today, and this evening," she glanced up at the
moon, which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves of effulgence,
"I expect to have more," she confessed.asked Eleanor, "I'm sorry I can't sit up with you then
and help you.You--you don't expect to be--provocated to _slap_
anybody, do you?""No, I don't, but as things are going I almost wish I did," Gertrude
answered, not realizing that before the evening was over there would
be one person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap several times
over.As they turned into the village street from the beach road they met
Jimmie, who had been having his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather
Amos, with whom he had become a prime favorite.With him was
Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing more than
blandly."This virtuous child has been urging me to come after Eleanor and
remind her that it is bedtime," Jimmie said, indicating the pink
gingham clad figure at his side."She argues that Eleanor is some six
months younger than she and ought to be in bed first, and personally
she has got to go in the next fifteen minutes.""It's pretty hot weather to go to bed in," Albertina said."Miss
Sturgis, if I can get my mother to let me stay up half an hour more,
will you let Eleanor stay up?"Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her ample back, Eleanor was
making gestures intended to convey the fact that sitting up any longer
was abhorrent to her."Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think," Gertrude answered,
professionally maternal."I brought Albertina so that our child might go home under convoy,
while you and I were walking on the beach," Jimmie suggested.As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning of their
conversation drifted back to the other two, who stood watching them
for a moment."I thought I'd come over to see if you was willing to say you were
sorry," Albertina began."My face stayed red in one spot for two hours
that day after you slapped me.""I'm not sorry," Eleanor said ungraciously, "but I'll say that I am,
if you've come to make up.""Well, we won't say any more about it then," Albertina conceded."Are
Miss Sturgis and Mr.Sears going together, or are they just friends?""Isn't that Albertina one the limit?"Jimmie inquired, with a piloting
hand under Gertrude's elbow."She told me that she and Eleanor were
mad, but she didn't want to stay mad because there was more going on
over here than there was at her house and she liked to come over.""I'm glad Eleanor slapped her," Gertrude said; "still I'm sorry our
little girl has uncovered the clay feet of her idol.She's through
with Albertina for good.""Do you know, Gertrude," Jimmy said, as they set foot on the
glimmering beach, "you don't seem a bit natural lately.You used to be
so full of the everlasting mischief.Every time you opened your mouth
I dodged for fear of being spiked.Yet here you are just as docile as
other folks.""Don't you like me--as well?"Gertrude tried her best to make her
voice sound as usual."Better," Jimmie swore promptly; then he added a qualifying--"I
guess."But she didn't allow him the opportunity to answer."I'm in a transition period, Jimmie," she said."I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways into which she
has fallen as a result of all her other injudicious training, and,
instead of that, I'm doing nothing but think of myself and my own
hankerings and yearnings and such.I thought I could do so much for
the child.""That's the way we all think till we tackle her and then we find it
quite otherwise and even more so.Tell me about your hankerings and
yearnings.""Tell me about your job, Jimmie."And for a little while they found
