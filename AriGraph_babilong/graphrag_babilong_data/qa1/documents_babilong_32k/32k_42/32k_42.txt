As you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the
desk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that
desk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the
ladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,
until his name became known the world over.It has long been a
favorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the
painter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,
and dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like
Whistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other
side," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a
gorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another
room--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and
mirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with
the three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red
ribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from
the single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side
the same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the
popularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is
evident.[Illustration: RODIN]

It is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I
know in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of
intime and cosiness about Lavenue's that makes one always wish to
return.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]

You will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,
for the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and
the equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and
the newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger
children--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with
champagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,
and little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to
follow.All these you will see at Lavenue's on the "cheap side"--and the
beautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with
one of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front
room with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and
monsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of
M. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an
excellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could
never go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,
and at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its
picturesque garden----

"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little
girl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the
day--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me
whistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I
moved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool
court-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full
of chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will
hear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"
By Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]

And Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for
years, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their
tastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,
with les hommes celebres?C'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count
his decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax
enthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he
always eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is
so amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and
madame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his
work--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of
them, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor
opposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for
the government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been
building up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,
all the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a
giantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her
existence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an
American building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a
Juno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,
her figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,
quiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will
surprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been
thrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a
smattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of
the theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and
law and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in
the cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the
French call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their
days are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and
energy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the
studio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]

The painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a
decorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,
from careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,
laying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month
later, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of
the blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,
mayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at
two, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast
liner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the
Hudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be
unrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where
its rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids
and the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will
appear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from
Ithaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and
potatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and
agree "it's grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up
his studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came
at two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des
Lilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt
terrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is
the farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just
opposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace
is crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of
people along the "Boul' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only
light coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,
too, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg
Gardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very
well-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]

At the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the
concierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed
and furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this
faithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the
den of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old
swords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place
is quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day
and talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the
number of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your
court by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is
waked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court
full of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your
concierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters
who do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the
guardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of
Pere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de
menage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and
beds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at
all, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be
taken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does
not know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will
regale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,
including your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,
always concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is
quite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of
Monsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in
the rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress
with her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the
evening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or
dining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]

Alice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage
than any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was
harder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,
when barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her
name and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After
many days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de
Marcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,
with her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in
order to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a
demi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of
this--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found
employment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the
morning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the
different houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid
her a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie
turned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering
bread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced
to meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to
relieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice
fairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty
francs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave
little Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]

"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,"
said Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good
femme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No," she continued, "I shall
never marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,
"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I
can work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,
and I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,
where, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for
bon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in
my dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the
wife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,
for he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a
charming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI

"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S"


Just off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,
you will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny
gas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where
a dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience
in the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as
the piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed
one)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,
poet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs
of Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]

From these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest
and most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they
have absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no
mincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the
trouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with
the Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique
Francaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by
them, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of
the day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of
good-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should
evince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,
who are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never
vulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility
enables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little
song with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause
that follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from
the heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay's is a
popular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little
room nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the
further end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in
clever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of
green-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the
little tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through
this anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There
is the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is
different from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller
variety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,
scarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the
cabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which
includes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the
little tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black
frock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the
solemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the
lighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his
turn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his
short, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he
rushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]

A broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is
talking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly
his turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,
he is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate
fanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has
finished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,
and then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three
handclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the
proper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it
never fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes
hurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat
upon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives
an extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny
expression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,
and then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks
serio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black
frock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet
collar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;
these, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this
every-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more
eccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round
face and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed
in a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some
pre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the
good bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval
fringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is
overwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and
girls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and
cigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador
avec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at
them to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually
subsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the
bard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and
cocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic
songs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling
and intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are
stirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he
grasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its
celestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning
for a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his
head.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres
in the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the
"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,
D'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over
in Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that
they meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who
can draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no
bread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the
boulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a
caricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a
well-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the
academies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with
portfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly
gray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too
little food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch
is strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression
that delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]

"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of
it that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the
velvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles
and jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was
all over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn
themselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,
for "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to
make trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and
fame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure
it will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains
toute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded
as a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a
day without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is
considered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay
rising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c'est gai
la-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful
country?"they will exclaim, as you
enthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm
by short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad
they will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your
disappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all
this continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to
end in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a
new sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into
automobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut
that growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it
stands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its
owner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace
over a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;
Marie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and
high boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is
working itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur
and his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace
veil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he
climbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be 'en
ballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no
longer mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with
the woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the
ceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight
up among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even
the memory of one's intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic
Parisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a
little chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair
and white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in
his peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush
through and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the
basket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch
blocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;
to-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we
are patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we
have courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over
the failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon
'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our
dinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and
hums a little chansonette."Je t'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *

I did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the
gentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have
heard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne
du Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,
could not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a
week![Illustration: (woman)]

CHAPTER VII

"POCHARD"


Drunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these
people do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable
to a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when
drunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and
filthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices
a jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his
arms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in
front of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent
of abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own
concoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move
on to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any
attention to him.On he strides up the "Boul' Miche," past the cafes,
continuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and
confines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let
alone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

You will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with
his wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly
looking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying
to warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry
leaves shivering.The yellow glow from the
shop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant
diamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall
days make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy
cheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]

Soon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country
haunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this
Quartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy
season.Thus it was that Lachaume
and I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,
his face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]

He stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and
leaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed
vacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small
kitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to
approach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it
patiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in
Paris.""What I'm drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued
Lachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I'm twenty years his
senior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend
leaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny
trickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]

"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he
went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."John went to the office.The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

news of the defeat of the Federal forces at Bull Run had reached
Lexington, and late as it was the streets were thronged with an excited
crowd.Cheers for Beauregard and the Southern Confederacy seemed to be
on every tongue.If the Union had friends, they were silent.In the
estimation of the excited crowd the South was already victorious; the
North humbled and vanquished.It was now but a step before Washington
would be in the possession of the Southern army, and Lincoln a prisoner
or a fugitive.That the Union army had been defeated was a surprise to Fred.He now
knew why Nelson was so urgent about the dispatches, and realized as
never before that the nation was engaged in a desperate conflict.The
cries of the mob angered him."I wonder where the Union men are," he
growled; "are they cowards that they keep silent?"And Fred was about to
let out a good old-fashioned yell for the Union, regardless of
consequences, when he recollected the mission he was on.It must not be;
he must do nothing to endanger the success of his journey, and he bit
his lip and kept silent, but his blood was boiling.Just before the
train started two gentlemen came in and took the seat in front of him.They were in excellent humor, and exulting over the Confederate victory
in Virginia.He was a prominent
politician, and an officer of the State Guards.The other gentleman was
not so distinguished looking as his companion, but his keen eyes gave
his clear-cut features a kind of dare-devil expression.But beyond this,
there was something about the man that would give one the impression
that he was not only a man of daring, but of cool, calculating judgment,
just the man to lead in a movement that would require both daring and
coolness.As soon as they had seated themselves, the first gentleman,
whom we will call Major Hockoday, turned to his companion and said:

"Well, Morgan, isn't this glorious news?I knew those truckling Yankees
could never stand before the gentlemen of the South.Washington will fall, and Lincoln will be on his knees
before a week, begging for peace."Major Hockoday's companion was no less a personage than John H. Morgan,
afterward one of the most daring raiders and dashing cavalry leaders
produced by the South.Morgan did not answer for a moment, and then slowly replied:

"Major, I think that you politicians, both North and South, ought to
show more sense than you do.There are those Northern politicians who
have been declaring the war would not last for ninety days.The time is
up, and the war has hardly begun.Now you fellows who have been
associating so long with the dough-faces of the North, think the whole
North is a truckling, pusillanimous set.In my business I have met
another class in the North--thrifty and earnest.They are not only
earnest, but brave; and not only brave, but stubborn.I fear the effects of this victory will be just opposite
to what you think.It will make our people overconfident; it will tend
to unify the North and nerve her to greater exertion.""Nonsense, Morgan," replied Major Hockoday, "what ails you?You will
hardly hear a peep from the Union men of Kentucky after to-morrow.The
only thing I regret is that Kentucky has not taken her rightful place in
the Southern Confederacy.We have talked neutrality so much, it is hard
to get away from it.""Hockoday, like you, I think Kentucky has played the rôle of neutral too
long--so long that she is already lost to the Confederacy, only to be
retaken at the point of the bayonet.Central Kentucky is already in the
hands of that devil, Nelson.Poorly organized as he is, he is much
better organized than we.how I would like to be at the head of a
cavalry regiment and raid that camp at Dick Robinson; and I would do it,
too, if I had my way.But you politicians, with your neutrality, have
spoiled everything.""Look here, Morgan," replied Major Hockoday, a little nettled, "be
reasonable.Look at the Union sentiment we
had to contend with.We had to
take neutrality to keep the State from going bodily over to the
Yankees----"

"That's it," broke in Morgan, "with your twaddle about State rights you
allowed your hands to be tied.The Legislature should have been
dispersed at the point of the bayonet, the election annulled, and
Kentucky declared out of the Union.If we had done this two months ago,
we would have been all right.""That is what we propose to do now," said the major."See here, Morgan,"
and he lowered his voice to a whisper.Fred yawned, and leaned his head
forward on the seat apparently for a good sleep, but his ears were never
more alert.He could only now and then catch a word something like this:

"Send message--Tompkins--Louisville--Knights Golden Circle--take
Louisville--Stop at Frankfort--Send Captain Conway--All excitement--Bull
Run--Louisville ours."Fred leaned back in his seat, shut his eyes, and commenced to think
hard.And this is the conclusion that he reached: That
Major Hockoday was going to send a message from Frankfort to some one in
Louisville; that there was to be an uprising of the Secessionists with
the intention of capturing the city.thought Fred, "if I could
only get hold of that message.In the rear of the car sat two men, one dressed in the uniform of a
Federal officer; the other a sharp, ferret-looking man who would readily
pass for a detective.He thought a moment, and then said to himself, "I
don't like the deception, but it is the only way.If I have the
opportunity, I will try it.It may
mean much to the Union cause; it may mean much to Louisville."The train stopped at Frankfort, and Major Hockoday and Morgan alighted.On the platform stood a short, stumpy man with a very red face and a
redder nose."How do you do, Captain," said Major Hockoday, stepping up to him and
shaking hands, at the same time slipping an envelope into his other
hand, and whispering some hurried instructions into his ear."Trust me," said the captain; "I will see that your letter reaches the
right person and in time."Fred had followed Major Hockoday out of the car, took note of every
movement, and heard every word that could be heard.The bell rang, and the captain entered the car.There was a little
delay, and Fred, who had got on the rear of the car, said to himself,
"This little delay is a blessed thing for me, for it helps me carry out
my plan."He waited until the train was getting under good headway, and
then entered the car puffing and blowing and dropped into the seat
beside the captain, where he sat panting as if entirely exhausted."You seem to have had a hard run for it, my boy," said the captain."Y-e-s,--had--to--make--it.Had--to--see--you," panted Fred, speaking in
gasps."I reckon there must be
some mistake."Wa-wait--until--I--catch--my--breath," and Fred sat
puffing as if he had run a mile race.His companion eyed him not only
in surprise, but with suspicion.After Fred had let sufficient time elapse to regain his breath, he said
in a low tone: "You are Captain Conway of the State Guards, are you
not?""You have just received an important letter from Major Hockoday to be
delivered in Louisville."Captain Conway stared at Fred in astonishment; then said in a fierce
whisper, "How do you know that?""Don't get excited," whispered Fred; "don't attract attention, or all is
lost.Hardly had the major placed the letter in your hands
before he received the startling intelligence that he had been watched,
and you spotted.Do you see those two men in the rear of the car, one in
the uniform of a Federal officer, the other a keen looking fellow?"Captain Conway turned quickly and saw the men, both of whom happened to
be looking at him, and as the captain imagined with sinister designs."The gentleman seated by the side of the officer," continued Fred, "is a
noted detective from Danville.The plan is to declare you a celebrated
thief, and arrest you and take you off the cars at Eminence.Once off,
they will search you, get your dispatches, and let you go.""But there may be some on the train who know me.""That will make no difference; they will claim they are not mistaken,
and that you must prove you are not the person wanted before some
magistrate."What did Major Hockoday say for me to do?"asked the now
thoroughly frightened captain."He said that you should give me the letter, and for you to leave the
train before it reached Eminence, thus giving them the slip.""Boy, you are an impostor.It is simply a plot to get hold of the
letter.Why did not Major Hockoday write me this order?"What do you think will happen when you are
arrested and Major Hockoday's letter gets in the hands of his enemies.He will shoot you at sight for betraying him.""How do I know you tell the truth?"asked the captain, visibly
weakening."How did I know about the letter of Major Hockoday, if he had not sent
me?""To whom am I to deliver this
letter?"He was in hopes that Fred could not answer."Tompkins," answered Fred, trembling, thinking his answer might be
wrong.The captain was convinced, yet sat silent and undecided.He glanced
back; the men were still looking at him.He shivered, and then slyly
slipped the letter into Fred's hand.The train stopped, and the captain
arose and went forward as for a drink of water.At the door he hesitated
as if still undecided.No, he would jump from the train himself first.The bell rang for the
train to start, and the captain turned as if to come back, at the same
time glancing at the two gentlemen in the rear of the car.The
detective-looking individual had arisen to his feet, and was reaching
for his hip pocket.Captain Conway waited to see no more; he turned, bolted from the car,
and plunged from the now moving train into the darkness.The detective-looking gentleman drew a handkerchief from his pocket,
wiped his perspiring face, and sat down again.On such little incidents
do great events sometimes depend.For a
moment he felt exultant, and then his face grew serious.He had always
been the soul of truth and honor."And now," he thought, bitterly, "I
have been lying like a pirate."He hardly knew, and
the wheels of the cars seemed to say, as they rattled along, "You are a
liar, you are a liar," over and over again, until he leaned his head on
the seat in front of him, and his tears fell thick and fast.He had yet to learn that deception was one of the least evils
of war.The dawn of the long summer day was just beginning to brighten the east
when the train rolled into the station at Louisville.Early as it was,
the streets were full of excited men and boys, cheering for Jeff Davis
and the South.Fred at once found his way to the home of one of the best
known Union men of the city, whom we will call Mr.The household
was already astir, and Fred's ring was at once answered by a servant,
who cautiously opened the door and asked, "Who is dar?""Tell him a messenger from Lieutenant Nelson wishes to see him."The servant withdrew, and in a moment returned, and throwing open the
door, said, "Massa says, come right in, sah."Fred was ushered into a large drawing-room, where to his surprise he met
the inquiring gaze of more than a score of serious looking men.They
were the prominent Union men of the city, conferring with a number of
the city officials as to the best method of preserving peace and order
during the day.The danger was great, and how to meet it without
precipitating a conflict was the question which confronted them.Now all
were interested in the message brought by Fred, and his youthful
appearance caused them to wonder why Nelson had chosen so young a
messenger."You have a message from Lieutenant Nelson, I understand," said Mr."Last evening a little after seven," answered Fred."Impossible; you are an impostor."I rode to Nicholasville in time to catch the ten
o'clock train to Lexington, thence to Louisville."The feat to them seemed
scarcely possible.Spear, "must be important to demand such haste."Here, sir," replied Fred, handing him the letter.Spear hastily
tore it open and read:


     DANVILLE, KY., July 21, 7:00 P. M.
     TO THE UNION MEN OF LOUISVILLE:

     I have just received news of the defeat of our forces at Bull Run.Even if Washington falls, we must not despair.Kentucky must be
     held for the Union.Thank God, I have organized enough troops to
     hold Central Kentucky against any force the disorganized rebels can
     bring against us.Hold Louisville,
     if her streets run red with blood.Do not let the loyal officials
     be driven from power.Spear, "the advice of Lieutenant Nelson should be
followed to the letter.The city must be saved, peaceably if possible,
by force if necessary."There had been a few in the assembly who had hesitated on the expediency
of using force, but the ringing words of Nelson had completely won them
over.Louisville was to be held for the Union, come what might.Spear, "in the name of the loyal citizens of our
city, let us thank this brave boy."Fred blushed, and then stammered, "This is not all, gentlemen."Then in
a modest way, he told of his overhearing the conversation between Major
Hockoday and Morgan, of his plan to get possession of the letter, and
how well he had succeeded."And here, gentlemen," he continued, "is the
letter."There was a murmur of astonishment, and Mr.Spear, taking the letter,
broke it open and read:


     LEXINGTON, KY., July 21st, 10 P. M.
     J. T. TOMPKINS, LOUISVILLE, KY.Honored Sir:--The news of the great victory in Virginia will kindle
     a flame from one end of Kentucky to the other.By the time this
     reaches you, I trust Washington will be in the hands of the
     Confederate army, and Lincoln a prisoner or a fugitive.Now is the
     time to strike.The State Guards are eager, but owing to the stand
     of the State regarding neutrality, it would not be wise for them to
     begin a revolution in favor of the South, as that action would
     bring the Federal troops down on us, and we are not strong enough
     yet to resist them.You are at the head
     of a powerful secret order known as "The Knights of the Golden
     Circle."The State is not responsible for your acts or those of
     your organization.During the excitement of to-morrow organize your
     order, and hurl the cowardly and traitorous city officials of
     Louisville from power.The State Guards will not do anything to
     prevent you, and many, as individuals, will help you.Act promptly
     fearing nothing.See that not a single Union rag is left waving in
     Louisville by to-morrow night.Signed: MAJOR C. S. HOCKODAY,
     _State Guards_.For a moment the men looked into each other's faces without a word;
then there came a storm of indignation.was the exclamation heard on all
sides.John journeyed to the bedroom."Forewarned is forearmed," said Mr."Gentlemen, I
think we shall be fully prepared for Mr.Tompkins and his 'Knights of
the Golden Circle,' What say you?"Tompkins will get a warm
reception."Then they crowded around Fred and nearly shook his hand off.But he sat
silent, and at last looking up with burning cheeks, stammered:
"But--but, I lied--to Conway."He said this so earnestly, and looked so dejected that the company at
first did not know what to say; then they all burst out laughing.This hurt Fred worse than a reprimand, and the tears came into his eyes.Spear seeing how it was, at once commanded attention, and said:
"Gentlemen, our levity is ill-advised.This boy is as truthful as he is
brave.As he looks at it, he has been guilty of an untruth."Then
turning to Fred, he took him gently by the hand, and said: "Your action
is but a fitting testimonial to your truthful nature.What you have done, instead of being wrong, was an act of the greatest
heroism, and you deserve and will receive the thanks of every Union
man.""I know so, and not only this, but your action may save hundreds of
lives and our city from destruction.Let the good that you have done
atone for the deception you practiced towards Captain Conway."Then he was told he must have some rest after his
terrible ride and the exciting events of the night.He was ushered into
a darkened chamber, and not until after he had lain down, and the
excitement under which he had labored began to pass away did he realize
how utterly exhausted he was.Tired nature soon asserted itself, and he
slept the peaceful sleep of the young.When Fred awoke, the house was very still.He looked at his watch, and
to his surprise found it was after ten o'clock.Hurriedly dressing, he
went downstairs, where he met Mrs.Spear, and when he apologized for
sleeping so late, she told him she had orders not to awake him, but to
let him sleep as long as he would."But come," she said, "you must be
nearly famished," and she led him into the dining-room where a tempting
meal was spread.What puzzled Fred was, that although it was so near midday, the house
was darkened and the gas burning.Spear appeared nervous and excited, and the servants looked as though
frightened out of their wits.Although everything was so still in the
house, from out-of-doors there arose a confused noise as of the tramping
of many feet, the mingling of many voices, and now and then the sound of
wild cheering as of an excited mob.She smiled sadly and said:

"This promises to be a terrible day for Louisville.But for the
forbearance of the Union men, there would have been bloody fighting
before this.The news of the Confederate victory in Virginia has crazed
the rebel element.It is thought an effort will be made to overthrow the
city government.If there is, there will be bloody work, for the Union
element is prepared.Companies of men are in readiness all over the city
to spring to arms at a moment's notice.I fear for my husband, I fear
for all of our lives, for Mr.She stopped,
choked back a sob, and drawing herself proudly up, continued with
flashing eyes: "But Louisville will be saved, if husband, house and
everything go."Of such metal were the loyal women of Kentucky.Fred hastily swallowed a
cup of coffee, ate enough to appease his hunger, and announced his
intention of going out on the street.Spear; "my husband left special word for you
to remain indoors."That is just the reason I shall go out," he answered,
quietly."Then, if you must go," replied Mrs.Spear, "here is a weapon," and she
handed him a superb revolver."You may need it, but do not use it except
to protect your own life, or the life of a Union man.This is the order
given to all loyal citizens.Do nothing to provoke a quarrel; keep
silent even if insulted, but if a conflict comes, protect yourself."Fred thanked her, promised to be careful, and went forth into the city.Through the principal streets, vast throngs were sweeping, acting as if
bereft of reason.Union
flags were being trailed in the dust and stamped in the mire.Cries for
Jeff Davis, and groans for Lincoln were heard on every hand.As time went on, the mob grew more violent."Kill the <DW65>-stealers!"were the cries which echoed and re-echoed
through the streets.Soon stories of outrages, of private grounds being
entered and flags torn down, of brutal beatings began to be heard.The
Unionists began to gather in knots and resent insult.Yet each side
seemed to dread the beginning of a real conflict.Chief among those exciting the people was Tompkins, the head of the
"Knights of the Golden Circle."He raged through the streets, defying
all authority.Fred looked on the growing excitement with the blood
swiftly coursing through his veins.His eyes blazed with fury when he
saw the stars and stripes trailed in the dust of the street.He trembled
with suppressed rage when he saw Union men reviled, insulted."It is true," he said, bitterly, to himself, "that Union men are
cowards, miserable cowards, or they would resent these insults."But
Fred was mistaken; braver men never lived than the Union men of
Louisville, who endured the taunts and insults of that day, rather than
provoke a conflict, the end of which no man could tell.After a time Fred found himself on a residence street where there was a
break in the mob, and the street was comparatively quiet.During this
quiet a young lady came out of a house, and hurriedly passed down the
street.Suddenly a fragment of the mob drifted through the street, and
she was caught in the vortex.On her bosom was pinned a small Union
flag.A burly ruffian in the mob espied it, and rushing up to her,
shouted: "Off with that dirty rag, you she-Lincolnite!""Never," she exclaimed, with a pale face but flashing eye."Then I will take it," he exclaimed, with a coarse oath, and snatched at
the flag so roughly as to tear her dress, exposing her pure white bosom
to the gaze of the brutal mob.There was a howl of delight, and the wretch made bolder, cried: "Now for
a kiss, my beauty," and attempted to catch her in his smutty arms.Fred had seen the outrage, and picking up a
brick that happened to lie loose on the pavement, he sprang forward and
dealt the ruffian such a blow on the side of the head that he fell like
a log, striking the pavement with such force that the blood gushed from
his nose and mouth.[Illustration: He dealt the Ruffian such a Blow that he fell like a
log.]"Kill the young devil of a Lincolnite!"was the cry, and the crowd
surged towards Fred.But those in advance drew back, for they looked
into the muzzle of a revolver held by a hand that did not tremble, and
gazed into young eyes that did not waver."The first man that attempts to touch her or me, dies," said Fred, in a
clear, firm voice.The mob shrank back; then a fierce cry arose of "Kill
him!"Take the young lady to a place of safety," said a low voice by Fred's
side; then to the mob, "Back!Fred looked, and by his side stood a stalwart policeman, a glistening
revolver in his hand.Near him stood other determined men, ready to
assist."Come," said Fred, taking the young lady's arm, and the two quickly made
their way out of the mob, which, balked of its prey, howled in futile
rage."I live here," said the young lady, stopping before a palatial
residence.You must come in and let my mother
thank you.How brave you were, and Policeman Green, too.How can I thank
you both enough for what you did!""You must excuse me now," replied Fred, politely raising his hat; "but
to-morrow, if possible, I will call, and see if you have experienced any
ill effects from the rough treatment you have received.But I must go
now, for I may be of some further use," and with a bow, Fred was gone."If he were only older, I would have a mind to throw Bob overboard,"
said the young lady to herself, as she entered the house.Going back to the scene of his adventure, Fred found that a great crowd
had gathered around the place where he had knocked the ruffian down.yelled Tompkins, coming up at the head of a multitude of
followers."Shure," cried an Irish voice, "Big Jim is kilt intoirely, intoirely."demanded Tompkins, with an oath.By this time
Big Jim, with the aid of two companions, had staggered to his feet, and
was looking around in a dazed condition."He will come around all right," said Tompkins.Down with the city officials; let's
throw them into the Ohio," and with frightful cries, the mob started for
the city hall.But the brave, loyal policeman, G. A. Green, the one who had assisted
Fred, was before them."Stop," he cried, "the first man who tries to
enter this building dies."With a curse, Tompkins rushed on with the cry, "Down with the
Lincolnites!"There was the sharp crack of a revolver, and Tompkins staggered and fell
dead.Before they could rally there
stood around the brave policeman a company of armed men.This was not
all; as if by magic, armed Home Guards appeared everywhere.Then a prominent officer of the Home Guard came forward
and said:

"We do not wish to shed more blood, but the first blow struck at the
city government, and these streets will run red with the blood of
Secessionists.Cowed, muttering, cursing, the mob began to melt away.The sun went down on one of the most exciting days Louisville
ever saw--a day that those who were there will never forget.The city was saved to the Union, and never afterward was it in grave
danger.Spear, to whom Fred had been relating
his experience."Hardly that," replied Fred, blushing."I am so glad it has ended well," continued Mrs.Spear; "you ran a
terrible danger, and I should never have forgiven myself for letting you
go out, if any evil had befallen you.""I should never have forgiven myself if I had not been there to protect
that brave young lady," answered Fred, firmly."Of course, a true knight must protect a fair lady," said Mrs."And you were fortunate, Sir Knight, for Mabel Vaughn is one of the
fairest of Louisville's daughters.It was just like her to brave any
danger rather than conceal her colors."She seems to be a very nice young lady," replied Fred, "and she is
extremely pretty, too.""What a pity you are not older," said Mrs.Spear, "so you could fall in
love with each other and get married, just as they do in well-regulated
novels.""How do you know that I am not in love with her now?"answered Fred, his
eyes sparkling with merriment; "and as for my youth, I will grow."in that case, I am really sorry," replied Mrs.Spear, "for I think
she is spoken for."Fred assumed a tragic air, and said in bloodcurdling tones: "Where was
the recreant lover that he did not protect her?Never shall my good
sword rest until it drinks his craven blood.""You will call on your lady love
before you return?""Most assuredly, and it must be an early morning call, for I leave for
home at ten o'clock."The warmth of welcome given Fred by the Vaughns surprised him, and, to
his astonishment, he found himself a hero in their eyes.Miss Mabel Vaughn was a most charming young lady of eighteen, and when
she grasped Fred's hand, and, with tears in her eyes, poured out her
thanks, he felt a curious sensation about his heart, and as he looked
into her beautiful face, he could not help echoing the wish of Mrs.Spear, "Oh, that I were older."But this fancy received a rude shock when a fine looking young man,
introduced as Mr.Robert Marsden, grasped his hand, and thanked him for
what he had done for his betrothed."And to think," said Marsden, "that Mabel was in danger, and that you,
instead of me, protected her, makes me insanely envious of you.""As for that, Bob," archly said Miss Mabel, "I am glad you were not
there.Shackelford did far better than you would have
done."Seeing he looked hurt, Miss Vaughn
continued: "I mean you would have been so rash you might have been
killed.""Which would have been far worse than if I had been killed," said Fred,
meekly.I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that!"cried Miss Vaughn,
bursting into tears."Which means I ought to be kicked for uttering a silly joke," answered
Fred, greatly distressed."Please, Miss Vaughn, let us change the
subject.How did you happen to be on the street?""I had been calling on a sick friend a few doors away, and I thought I
could reach home in safety during the few moments of quiet.My friend
wanted me to remove the little flag from the bosom of my dress before I
ventured out, but I refused, saying, 'I would never conceal my colors,'
and I was caught in the mob, as you saw.""And I shall consider it the happiest day of my life I was there,"
gallantly answered Fred."And we must not forget the brave policeman.""That I will not," replied Miss Vaughn."There is one good thing it has brought about, anyway," said Marsden."Mabel has at length consented that I shall enter the army.I shall wear this little flag that she
wore yesterday on my breast, and it will ever be an incentive to deeds
of glory, and it shall never be disgraced," and the young man's eyes
kindled as he said it.Had a shadow of the future floated before her?Months afterward that
little flag was returned to her bloodstained and torn.Vaughn, "this will never do, rather let us
rejoice that we are all alive and happy this morning.Two or three lively airs dispelled all the clouds, and Fred took his
leave with the promise that he would never come to Louisville without
calling.Fred's return to Nicholasville was without adventure.He wondered what
had become of Captain Conway, and laughed when he imagined the meeting
between the captain and Major Hockoday.He found Prince none the worse
for his fast riding, and jumping gaily on his back, started for home,
returning by way of Camp Dick Robinson.Here he met Lieutenant Nelson,
who warmly grasped his hand, and thanked him for his services in
delivering his message."But," continued Nelson, "I have heard rumors of your performing a still
more important part, and securing papers of the greatest value to us.When Fred related his meeting with Major Hockoday and Morgan, and how
he had wrung the dispatch from Captain Conway, Nelson nearly went into
an apoplectic fit from laughter.Then he stood up and looked at the boy
admiringly."Fred," he said, "you have done what one man in a hundred thousand could
not have done.Not only this; but if
you will enter my service, not as a spy, but as a special messenger and
scout, I will see that you are enrolled as such with good pay.""You must remember, sir, I am but a boy still under
the control of my father.I accepted the mission from you, which I did,
on the impulse of the moment; and I fear when I return home, I shall
find my father very much offended."My mother died but a few weeks ago, and since her death
father has taken no interest in the events going on around him.I have
never heard him express any opinion since the war really began.Before
that he was in hopes it could be settled peaceably.""Well, my boy, whatever happens, remember you have a friend in me.Not
only this, but if you can arrange it amicably with your father, I may
call on you, if at any time I have a very delicate mission I wish to
have performed."Fred thanked him, and rode on to his home.He found his father in very
earnest conversation with his uncle, Judge Pennington, and Colonel
Humphrey Marshall, a well-known Kentuckian.The trio were earnestly
discussing the war, Judge Pennington and Colonel Marshall trying to
convince Mr.Shackelford that it was his duty to come out boldly for the
South, instead of occupying his position of indifference.Shackelford saw Fred, he excused himself a moment, and calling
him, said: "Where in the world have you been, Fred?I thought you were
with your Cousin Calhoun, and therefore borrowed no trouble on account
of your absence.But when your uncle came a few moments ago, and
informed me you had not been there for three days, I became greatly
alarmed, and as soon as I could dismiss my visitors I was going to
institute a search for you.""I am all right, father," answered Fred.I
will tell you all about it when you are at leisure."Shackelford, and went back and resumed the
conversation with his guests.In the evening, when father and son were alone, Fred told where he had
been, and who sent him.Shackelford looked grave, and said:

"Fred, this is a bad business.Since the death of your mother, I have
taken but little interest in passing events.I have just awakened to the
fact that there is a great war in progress.""Yes, father," said Fred in a low tone, "war on the old flag.Shackelford did not answer for a moment, and then he said, with a
troubled countenance: "I had almost as soon lose my right arm as to
raise it against the flag for which my fathers fought.On the other
side, how can I, a man Southern born, raise my hand against my kindred?Kentucky is a sovereign State; as such she has resolved to be neutral.The South is observing this neutrality, the North is not.Even now the
Federal government is raising and arming troops right in our midst.This
Lieutenant Nelson, to whom you have rendered such valuable services, is
foremost in this defiance of the wishes of Kentucky.The raising and
arming of Federal troops must be stopped, or the whole State will be in
the throes of a fratricidal strife.Your uncle and Colonel Marshall are
for Kentucky's seceding and joining the South.For this I am not
prepared, for it would make the State the battleground of the contending
armies.Let me hear no
more of your aiding Nelson, or you are no son of mine.""Father, you say Kentucky is a sovereign State.Is it right then for
those who favor the South to try and force Kentucky into the Southern
Confederacy against the will of a majority of her people?"Shackelford hesitated, and then said: "As much right as the
Unionists have to force her to stay in.But I do not ask you to aid the
South, neither must you aid Nelson."Shackelford drew a deep sigh, and then continued: "Your mother
being a Northern woman, I suppose you have imbibed some of her peculiar
ideas.Under the circumstances, Fred thought it best not to say anything about
his adventure with Captain Conway, or what happened in Louisville.But
he readily promised his father he would do nothing to aid either side
without consulting him.Shackelford, "this business being settled, I have
another matter I wish to talk about.My business is in such shape it is
of the utmost importance that I get some papers to your Uncle Charles in
Nashville for him to sign.Mail, you know, is now prohibited between the
two sections.To travel between the two States is becoming nearly
impossible.Even now, the journey may
be attended with great danger; and I would not think of asking you if it
was not so important for your Uncle Charles to sign the papers.But as
much as I would like to have you make the journey, I shall not command
you, but let you exercise your own pleasure."shouted Fred, his boyish enthusiasm and love of
adventure aroused.You know a spice of danger adds
enjoyment to one's journey.""Well," said his father, "it is all settled, then, but be very careful,
for they tell me the whole country is in a state of fearful ferment.One thing more, Fred; if you have any Union sentiment, suppress it
entirely while you are gone.It will not do in Middle Tennessee; there
are no Union men there."The next morning, after kissing his little sister good-bye, and
promising his father to be very careful, Fred started on his journey.Nashville was about one hundred and sixty miles away, and he calculated
he could reach it in three days.From Danville he took the main road to
Liberty, thence to Columbia, where he stopped for the night.His next
day's ride took him to Glasgow, then south to Scottsville.He found the
whole country in a state of the greatest excitement; and passed numerous
companies of Kentuckians going south to join the Confederate army.After
leaving Columbia, he saw nothing but the Confederate flag displayed.If
there were any Unionists, they did not let the fact be known.Just over on the Tennessee side, as he passed into that State, was a
large encampment of Confederate troops; and Fred was repeatedly asked to
enlist, while many a covetous eye was cast on his horse.It was
afternoon before he reached Gallatin, where he stopped for refreshments
for himself and horse.He found the little city a perfect hotbed of excitement.The people were
still rejoicing over the victory at Bull Run, and looking every day for
Washington to fall.To them the war was nearly over, and there was joy
on every countenance.When it became known at the hotel that Fred was
from Kentucky, he was surrounded by an eager crowd to learn the news
from that State.In reply to his eager questioners, Fred said:

"Gentlemen, I do not know that I can give you anything new.You know
that Kentucky has voted to remain neutral, but that does not prevent our
people from being pretty evenly divided.Many of our most prominent men
are advocating the cause of the South, but as yet they have failed to
overcome the Union sentiment.The day after the battle of Bull Run there
was a riot in Louisville, and it was thought that the friends of the
South might be able to seize the city government, but the movement
failed.""You are all right in that section of the country, are you not?""On the contrary," replied Fred, "a Lieutenant Nelson has organized a
camp at Dick Robinson, but a few miles from where I live, and is engaged
in raising ten regiments of Kentucky troops for the Federal army."The news was astounding, and a murmur of surprise ran through the crowd,
which became a burst of indignation, and a big red-faced man shouted:

"It's a lie, youngster; Kentuckians are not all cowards and
Abolitionists.You are nothing but a Lincolnite in disguise."You are right," said Fred, advancing on the man, "when you say all
Kentuckians are not cowards.Some of them still have courage to resent
an insult, especially when it is offered by a cur," and he dealt the man
a blow across the face with his riding-whip with such force as to leave
an angry, red mark.The man howled with pain and rage, and attempted to draw a revolver, but
stout hands laid hold of him, and he was dragged blaspheming away.Meanwhile it looked as if there might be a riot.Some were hurrahing for
the boy; others were shaking their heads and demanding that Fred further
give an account of himself.He had been called a Lincolnite, and that
was enough to damn him in the eyes of many.cried a commanding looking young man,
dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant of the Confederate army, pushing
his way through the crowd."Oh, this hyear young feller struck Bill Pearson across the face with
his ridin'-whip for callin' him a Lincolnite and a liah," volunteered a
seedy, lank looking individual."Which seems full enough provocation for a blow.Bill is fortunate he
hasn't got a hole through him," responded the young lieutenant."But maybe he is a Lincolnite," persisted the seedy individual."He
said Kentuck wouldn't 'cede, and that they was raisin' sogers to help
whip we 'uns.""Who are
you, and where did you come from?"Fred explained what had happened; how he had been asked for news from
Kentucky, and that he had told them only the truth.He then gave his
name, and said he was on his way to Nashville to visit his uncle,
Charles Shackelford."Fellow-citizens," said the young officer in a voice that at once
commanded attention, "this young man informs me that he is a nephew of
Major Charles Shackelford of Nashville, who is now engaged in raising a
regiment for the Confederate service.No nephew of his can be a
Lincolnite.As for the news he told, unfortunately
it's true.Kentucky, although thousands of her gallant sons have joined
us, still clings to her neutrality, or is openly hostile to us.It is
true, that a renegade Kentuckian by the name of Nelson is enlisting
troops for the Yankees right in the heart of Kentucky.But I believe,
almost know, the day is not distant, when the brave men of Kentucky who
are true to their traditions and the South will arise in their might,
and place Kentucky where she belongs, as one of the brightest stars in
the galaxy of Confederate States.In your name, fellow-citizens, I want
to apologize to this gallant young Kentuckian for the insult offered
him."The young lieutenant ceased speaking, but as with one voice, the
multitude began to cry, "Go on!A speech, Bailie, a speech!"Thus abjured, Lieutenant Bailie Peyton, for it was he, mounted a
dry-goods box, and for half an hour poured forth such a torrent of
eloquence that he swayed the vast audience, which had gathered, as the
leaves of the forest are swayed by the winds of heaven.He first spoke of the glorious Southland; her sunny skies, her sweeping
rivers, her brave people.He pictured to them the home of their
childhood, the old plantation, where slept in peaceful graves the loved
ones gone before.Strong men stood with tears running down their cheeks; women sobbed
convulsively."Is there one present that will not die for such a land?"he cried in a voice as clear as a trumpet, and there went up a mighty
shout of "No, not one!"He then spoke of the North; how the South would fain live in peace with
her, but had been spurned, reviled, traduced.Faces began to darken,
hands to clench.Then the speaker launched into a terrific philippic
against the North.He told of its strength, its arrogance, its
insolence.Lincoln was now marshaling his hireling hosts to invade their
country, to devastate their land, to desecrate their homes, to let loose
their slaves, to ravish and burn."Are we men," he cried, "and refuse
to protect our homes, our wives, our mothers, our sisters!"Men wept and cried like children, then
raved and yelled like madmen.With clenched hands raised towards heaven,
they swore no Yankee invader would ever leave the South alive.Women,
with hysterical cries, beseeched their loved ones to enlist.They
denounced as cowards those who refused.The recruiting officers present
reaped a rich harvest.As for Fred, he stood as one in a trance.Like
the others, he had been carried along, as on a mighty river, by the
fiery stream of eloquence he had heard.He saw the Southland invaded by
a mighty host, leaving wreck and ruin in its wake.He heard helpless
women praying to be delivered from the lust of brutal slaves, and
raising his hand to heaven he swore that such things should never be.His breast was torn with conflicting emotions,
he knew not what to think."I think you told me you were going to Nashville."It was Bailie Peyton
who spoke.Will you not go with me to my father's and stay all
night, and I will ride with you to Nashville in the morning?"Fred readily consented, for he was weary, and he also wanted to see more
of this wonderful young orator.Colonel Peyton, the father of Bailie Peyton, resided some three miles
out of Gallatin on the Nashville pike, and was one of the distinguished
