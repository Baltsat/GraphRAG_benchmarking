"A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.Daniel went to the bathroom.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety.Sandra went to the hallway."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.And when
she had heard Hellena's story, her feelings towards her underwent an
entire change.From this time forward the two women were firm friends, and Lightfoot
pledged herself to do all in her power to restore her to her friends.Her attachment to Captain Flint was still too strong, however, to make
her take any measures to effect that object, until she could do so
without endangering his safety.But Lightfoot was not the only friend that Hellena had secured since
her capture.She had made another, and if possible a firmer one, in
the person of Black Bill.From the moment Hellena entered the cavern, Bill seemed to be
perfectly fascinated by her.Had she been an angel just from heaven,
his admiration for her could hardly have been greater.He could not
keep his eyes off of her.He followed her as she moved about, though
generally at a respectful distance, and nothing delighted him so much,
as to be allowed to wait upon her and perform for her such little acts
of kindness as lay within his power.While Hellena was relating the story of her wrongs to Lightfoot, Black
Bill sat at a little distance off an attentive listener to the
narrative.When it was finished, and Hellena's eyes were filled with
tears, the darkey sprang up saying in an encouraging tone of voice:

"Don't cry, don't cry misses, de debble's comin arter massa Flint
berry soon, he tell me so hisself; den Black Bill take care ob de
white angel."This sudden and earnest outburst of feeling and kindness from the
<DW64>, expressed as it was in such a strange manner, brought a smile
to the face of the maiden, notwithstanding the affliction which was
crushing her to the earth."Why Bill," said Hellena, "you don't mean to say you ever saw the
devil here, do you?""Never seed him, but heer'd him doe, sometimes," replied Bill.Now, Hellena, although a sensible girl in her way, was by no means
free from the superstition of the times.She believed in ghosts, and
witches, and fairies, and all that, and it was with a look of
considerable alarm that she turned to the Indian woman, saying:

"I hope there ain't any evil spirits in this cave, Lightfoot.""No spirits here dat will hurt White Rose (the name she had given to
Hellena) or Lightfoot," said the Indian woman."The spirits of the great Indian braves who have gone to the land of
spirits come back here sometimes.""Neber see dem, but hear dem sometime," replied Lightfoot.said Lightfoot, "are they not my friends?"Lightfoot perceiving that Hellena's curiosity, as well as her fears
were excited; now in order to gratify the one, and to allay the other,
commenced relating to her some of the Indian traditions in relation to
the cavern.The substance of her narrative was as follows:

She said that a great while ago, long, long before the palefaces had
put foot upon this continent, the shores of this river, and the land
for a great distance to the east and to the west, was inhabited by a
great nation.No other nation could compare with them in number, or in
the bravery of their warriors.Every other nation that was rash enough
to contend with them was sure to be brought into subjection, if not
utterly destroyed.Their chiefs were as much renowned for wisdom, and eloquence as for
bravery.And they were as just, as they were wise and brave.Many of the weaker tribes sought their protection, for they delighted
as much in sheltering the oppressed as in punishing the oppressor.Thus, for many long generations, they prospered until the whole land
was overshadowed by their greatness.And all this greatness, and all this power, their wise men said, was
because they listened to the voice of the Great Spirit as spoken to
them in this cave.Four times during the year, at the full of the moon the principal
chiefs and medicine men, would assemble here, when the Great Spirit
would speak to them, and through them to the people.As long as this people listened to the voice of the Great Spirit,
every thing went well with them.But at last there arose among them a great chief; a warrior, who said
he would conquer the whole world, and bring all people under his rule.The priests and the wise men warned him of his folly, and told him
that they had consulted the Great Spirit, and he had told them that if
he persisted in his folly he would bring utter ruin upon his people.But the great chief only laughed at them, and called them fools, and
told them the warnings which they gave him, were not from the Great
Spirit, but were only inventions of their own, made up for the purpose
of frightening him.And so he persisted in his own headstrong course, and as he was a
great brave, and had won many great battles, very many listened to
him, and he raised a mighty army, and carried the war into the country
of all the neighbouring nations, that were dwelling in peace with his
own, and he brought home with him the spoils of many people.And then
he laughed at the priests and wise men once more, and said, go into
the magic cave again, and let us hear what the Great Spirit has to
say.And they went into the cave, as he had directed them.But they came
out sorrowing, and said that the Great Spirit had told them that he,
and his army should be utterly destroyed, and the whole nation
scattered to the four winds.And again he laughed at them, and called them fool, and deceivers.And he collected another great army, and went to war again.But by
this time the other nations, seeing the danger they were in, united
against him as a common enemy.He was overthrown, killed, and his army entirely cut to pieces.The conquering army now entered this country, and laid it waste, as
theirs had been laid waste before.And the war was carried on for many years, until the prophesy was
fulfilled that had been spoken by the Great Spirit, and the people of
this once mighty nation were scattered to the four winds.This people as a great nation are known no longer, but a remnant still
remains scattered among the other tribes.Occasionally some of them
visit this cave, to whom alone its mysteries are known, or were,
Lightfoot said, until she had brought Captain Flint there in order to
escape their pursuers."Is the voice of the Great Spirit ever heard here now?"Lightfoot said the voice of the Great Spirit had never been heard
there since the destruction of his favorite nation, but that the
spirits of the braves as he had said before, did sometimes come back
from the spirit-land to speak comfort to the small remnant of the
friends who still remained upon the earth.This narrative of the Indian woman somewhat satisfied the curiosity of
Hellena, but it did not quiet her fears, and to be imprisoned in a
dreary cavern haunted by spirits, for aught she knew, demons, was to
her imagination, about as terrible a situation as she could possibly
be placed in.CHAPTER X.


When there were none of the pirates in the cave, it was the custom of
Lightfoot, and Hellena to spread their couch in the body of the
cavern, and there pass the night.Such was the case on the night
following the day on which Lightfoot had related to Hellena the sad
history of her people.It is hardly to be expected that the young girl's sleep would be very
sound that night, with her imagination filled with visions, hob
goblins of every form, size, and color.During the most of the forepart of the night she lay awake thinking
over the strange things she had heard concerning the cave, and
expecting every moment to see some horrible monster make its
appearance in the shape of an enormous Indian in his war paint, and
his hands reeking with blood.After a while she fell into a doze in which she had a horrid dream,
where all the things she had been thinking of appeared and took form,
but assuming shapes ten times more horrible than any her waking
imagination could possibly have created.She had started from one of these horrid dreams,
and afraid to go to sleep again, lay quietly gazing around the cavern
on the ever varying reflections cast by the myriads of crystals that
glittered upon the wall and ceiling.Although there were in some portions of the cavern walls chinks or
crevices which let in air, and during some portion of the day a few
straggling sunbeams, it was found necessary even during the day to
keep a lamp constantly burning.And the one standing on the table in
the centre of the cave was never allowed to go out.As we have said, Hellena lay awake gazing about her.A perfect stillness reigned in the cave, broken only by the rather
heavy breathing of the Indian woman who slept soundly.Suddenly she heard, or thought she heard a slight grating noise at the
further side of the cavern.or does she actually
see the wall of the cavern parting?Such actually seems to be the
case, and from the opening out steps a figure dressed like an Indian,
and bearing in his hand a blazing torch.Hellena's tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth, and her limbs are
paralyzed with terror.The figure moves about the room with a step as noiseless as the step
of the dead, while the crystals on the walls seem to be set in motion,
and to blaze with unnatural brilliancy as his torch is carried from
place to place.He carefully examines everything as he proceeds; particularly the
weapons belonging to the pirates, which seemed particularly to take
his fancy.But he carefully replaces everything after having examined
it.He now approaches the place where the two women are lying.The figure approached the couch; for a moment he bent over it and
gazed intently on the two women; particularly on that of the white
maiden.When having apparently satisfied his curiosity, he withdrew as
stealthily as he had come.When Hellena opened her eyes again, the spectre had vanished, and
everything about the cave appeared as if nothing unusual had happened.For a long time she lay quietly thinking over the strange occurrences
of the night.She was in doubt whether scenes which she had witnessed
were real, or were only the empty creations of a dream.The horrible
spectres which she had seen in the fore part of the night seemed like
those which visit us in our dreams when our minds are troubled.But
the apparition of the Indian seemed more real.or were the two
scenes only different parts of one waking vision?To this last opinion she seemed most inclined, and was fully confirmed
in the opinion that the cavern was haunted.Although Hellena was satisfied in her own mind that the figure that
had appeared so strangely was a disembodied spirit, yet she had a
vague impression that she had somewhere seen that form before.But
when, or where, she could not recollect.When in the morning she related the occurrences of the night to
Lightfoot, the Indian expressed no surprise, and exhibited no alarm.Nor did she attempt to offer any explanation seeming to treat it as a
matter of course.Although this might be unsatisfactory to Hellena in some respects, it
was perhaps after all, quite as well for her that Lightfoot did not
exhibit any alarm at what had occurred, as by doing so she imparted
some of her own confidence to her more timid companion.All this while Black Bill had not been thought of but after a while he
crawled out from his bunk, his eyes twice their usual size, and coming
up to Hellena, he said:

"Misses, misses, I seed do debble last night wid a great fire-brand in
his hand, and he went all round de cabe, lookin' for massa Flint, to
burn him up, but he couldn't fine him so he went away agin.Now I know
he's comin' after massa Flint, cause he didn't touch nobody else.""No; but I kept mighty still, and shut my eyes when he come to look at
me, but he didn't say noffen, so I know'd it wasn't dis darkey he was
after."This statement of the <DW64>'s satisfied Hellena that she had not been
dreaming when she witnessed the apparition of the Indian.On further questioning Bill, she found he had not witnessed any of the
horrid phantoms that had visited her in her dreams.As soon as Hellena could do so without attracting attention, she took
a lamp and examined the walls in every direction to see if she could
discover any where a crevice large enough for a person to pass
through, but she could find nothing of the sort.The walls were rough and broken in many parts, but there was nothing
like what she was in search of.She next questioned Lightfoot about it, asking her if there was any
other entrance to the cave beside the one through which they had
entered.But the Indian woman gave her no satisfaction, simply telling her that
she might take the lamp and examine for herself.As Hellena had already done this, she was of course as much in the
dark as ever.When Captain Flint visited the cave again as he did on the following
day, Hellena would have related to him the occurrences of the previous
night, but she felt certain that he would only laugh at it as
something called up by her excited imagination, or treat it as a story
made up for the purpose of exciting his sympathy.Or perhaps invented for the purpose of arousing his superstition in
order to make him leave the cave, and take her to some place where
escape would be more easy.So she concluded to say nothing to him about it.About a week after the occurrence of the events recorded in the last
chapter, Captain Flint and his crew were again assembled in the
cavern.It was past midnight, and they evidently had business of
importance before them, for although the table was spread as upon the
former occasion, the liquors appeared as yet to be untasted, and
instead of being seated around the table, the whole party were sitting
on skins in a remote corner of the cavern, and conversing in a
suppressed tone of voice as if fearful of being heard."Something must be done," said one of the men, "to quiet this darn
suspicion, or it's all up with us.""I am for leaving at once," said Old Ropes; "the only safety for us
now is in giving our friends the slip, and the sooner we are out of
these waters the better it will be for us.""What, and leave the grand prize expecting to take care of itself?""Darn the prize," said Old Ropes, "the East Indiaman ain't expected
this two weeks yet, and if the suspicions agin us keep on increasin'
as they have for the last ten days, the land pirates'll have us all
strung up afore the vessel arrives."This opinion was shared by the majority of the men.Even the Parson
who took delight in opposing Old Ropes in almost every thing, agreed
with him here."Whether or not," said he, "I am afraid to face death in a fair
business-like way, you all know, but as sure as I'm a genuine parson,
I'd rather be tortured to death by a band of savage Indians, than to
be strung up to a post with my feet dangling in the air to please a
set of gaping fools.""Things do look rather squally on shore, I admit," said the captain,
"but I've hit upon a plan to remedy all that, and one that will make
us pass for honest men, if not saints, long enough to enable us to
finish the little job we have on hand.""Why, merely to make a few captures while we are lying quietly in the
harbour or a little way up the river.That'll turn the attention of
the people from us in another direction, in the mean while, we can
bide our time."We must man a whale boat or two and
attack some one of the small trading vessels that are coming in every
day.She must be run on the rocks where she may be examined
afterwards, so that any one may see that she has falling in the hands
of pirates.None of the crew must be allowed to escape, as that would
expose the trick."All this must take place while I am known to be on shore, and the
schooner lying in port."This plot, which was worthy the invention of a fiend, was approved by
all but Jones Bradley who declared that he would have nothing to do
with it.For which disobedience of orders he would have probably been
put to death had he been at sea.The plan of operations having been decided upon, the whole party
seated themselves round the table for the purpose as they would say of
making a night of it.But somehow or other they seemed to be in no humor for enjoyment, as
enjoyment is understood by such characters.A gloom seemed to have settled on the whole party.They could not even get their spirits up, by pouring spirits down.And although they drank freely, they drank for the most part in
silence.shouted captain Flint, "at last have we all lost our
voices?Can no one favor us with a song, or toast or a yarn?"Hardly had these words passed the lips of the captain, when the
piteous moan which had so startled the pirates, on the previous
evening again saluted them, but in a more suppressed tone of voice.The last faint murmurs of this moan had not yet died away, when a
shout, or rather a yell like an Indian war whoop, rang through the
cavern in a voice that made the very walls tremble, its thousand
echoes rolling away like distant thunder.The whole group sprang to their feet aghast.The two woman followed by Black Bill, terror stricken, joined the
group.This at least might be said of Hellena and the <DW64>.The latter
clinging to the skirts of the white maiden for protection, as a mortal
in the midst of demons might be supposed to seek the protection of an
Angel.Captain Flint, now laying his hand violently on Lightfoot, said, "What
does all this mean?do you expect to frighten me by your juggling
tricks, you infernal squaw?"At these words he gave her a push that
sent her staggering to the floor.In a moment he saw his mistake, and went to her assistance (but she
had risen before he reached her,) and endeavored to conciliate her
with kind words and presents.He took a gold chain from his pocket, and threw it about her neck, and
drew a gold ring from his own finger and placed it upon hers.These attentions she received in moody silence.All this was done by Flint, not from any feelings of remorse for the
injustice he had done the woman, but from a knowledge of how much he
was in her power and how dangerous her enmity might be to him.Finding that she was not disposed to listen to him, he turned from her
muttering to himself:

"She'll come round all right by and by," and then addressing his men
said:

"Boys, we must look into this matter; there's something about this
cave we don't understand yet.There may be another one over it, or
under it.He did not repeat the explanation he had given before, feeling no
doubt, that it would be of no use.A careful examination of the walls of the cave were made by the whole
party, but to no purpose.Nothing was discovered that could throw any
light upon the mystery, and they were obliged to give it up.And thus they were compelled to let the matter rest for the present.When the morning came, the pirates all left with the exception of the
captain, who remained, he said, for the purpose of making further
investigations, but quite as much for the purpose of endeavoring to
find out whether or not, Lightfoot had anything to do with the
production of the strange noises.But here again, he was fated to
disappointment.The Indian could not, or would not, give any
satisfactory explanation.The noises she contended were made by the braves of her nation who had
gone to the spirit world, and who were angry because their sacred
cavern had been profaned by the presence of the hated palefaces.Had he consulted Hellena, or Black Bill, his investigations would
probably have taken a different turn.The figure of the Indian having been seen by both Hellena and the
black, would have excited his curiosity if not his fears, and led him
to look upon it as a more serious matter than he had heretofore
supposed.But he did not consult either of them, probably supposing them to be a
couple of silly individuals whose opinions were not worth having.If any doubt had remained in the minds of the men in regard to the
supernatural character of the noises which had startled them in the
cave, they existed no longer.Even the Parson although generally ridiculing the idea of all sorts of
ghosts and hobgoblins, admitted that there was something in this
affair that staggered him, and he joined with the others in thinking
that the sooner they shifted their quarters, the better."Don't you think that squaw had a hand in it?"asked one of the men:
"didn't you notice how cool she took it all the while?""That's a fact," said the Parson; "it's strange I didn't think of that
before.I shouldn't wonder if it wasn't after all, a plot contrived by
her and some of her red-skinned brethren to frighten us out of the
cave, and get hold of the plunder we've got stowed away there."Some of the men now fell in with this opinion, and were for putting it
to the proof by torturing Lightfoot until she confessed her guilt.The majority of the men, however, adhered to the original opinion that
the whole thing was supernatural, and that the more they meddled with
it, the deeper they'd get themselves into trouble."My opinion is," said Old Ropes, "that there's treasure buried there,
and the whole thing's under a charm, cave, mountain, and all.""If there's treasure buried there," said the Parson, "I'm for having a
share of it.""The only way to get treasure that's under charm," said Old Ropes, "is
to break the charm that binds it, by a stronger charm.""It would take some blasting to get at treasure buried in that solid
rock," said Jones Bradley."If we could only break the charm that holds the treasure, just as
like as not that solid rock would all turn into quicksand," replied
Old Ropes."No; but I've seen them as has," replied Old Ropes."And more than that," continued Old Ropes, "my belief is that Captain
Flint is of the same opinion, though he didn't like to say so."I shouldn't wonder now, if he hadn't some charm he was tryin', and
that was the reason why he stayed in the cave so much.""I rather guess the charm that keeps the captain so much in the cave
is a putty face," dryly remarked one of the men.While these things had been going on at the cavern, and Captain Flint
had been pretending to use his influence with the Indians for the
recovery of Hellena, Carl Rosenthrall himself had not been idle in the
meantime.He had dealings with Indians of the various tribes along the river,
and many from the Far North, and West, and he engaged them to make
diligent search for his daughter among their people, offering tempting
rewards to any who would restore her, or even tell him to a certainty,
where she was to be found.In order to induce Fire Cloud to restore her in case it should prove
it was he who was holding her in captivity, he sent word to that
chief, that if he would restore his child, he would not only not have
him punished, but would load him with presents.These offers, of course made through Captain Flint, who it was
supposed by Rosenthrall, had more opportunities than any one else of
communicating with the old chief.How likely they would have been to reach the chief, even if he had
been the real culprit, the reader can guess.In fact he had done all in his power to impress the Indian that to put
himself in the power of Rosenthrall, would be certain death to him.Thus more than a month passed without bringing to the distracted
father any tidings of his missing child.We may as well remark here, that Rosenthrall had lost his wife many
years before, and that Hellena was his only child, so that in losing
her he felt that he had lost everything.The Indians whom he had employed to aid him in his search, informed
him that they could learn nothing of his daughter among their people,
and some of them who were acquainted with Fire Cloud, told him that
the old chief protested he knew nothing of the matter.Could it be that Flint was playing him false?He could hardly think that it was Flint himself who had stolen his
child, for what motive could he have in doing it?The more he endeavored to unravel the mystery, the stranger and more
mysterious it became.Notwithstanding the statements to the contrary made by the Indians,
Flint persisted in giving it as his belief, that Fire Cloud had
carried off the girl and was still holding her a prisoner.He even
said that the chief had admitted as much to him.Yet he was sure that
if he was allowed to manage the affair in his own way, he should be
able to bring the Indian to terms.It was about this time that the dark suspicions began to be whispered
about that Captain Flint was in some way connected with the horrible
piracies that had recently been perpetrated on the coast, if he were
not in reality the leader of the desperate gang himself, by whom they
had been perpetrated.Those suspicions as we have seen, coming to Flint's own ears, had
caused him to plan another project still more horrible than the one he
was pursuing, in order to quiet those suspicions until he should have
an opportunity of capturing the rich prize which was to be the
finishing stroke to his achievements in this part of the world.The suspicions in regard to Captain Flint had reached the ears of
Rosenthrall, as well as others, who had been secretly concerned with
him in his smuggling transactions, although in no way mixed up with
his piracies.Rosenthrall feared that in case these suspicions against Flint should
lead to his arrest, the whole matter would come out and be exposed,
leading to the disgrace if not the ruin, of all concerned.It was therefore with a feeling of relief, while joining in the
general expression of horror, that he heard of a most terrible piracy
having been committed on the coast.Captain Flint's vessel was lying
in port, and he was known to be in the city.There was one thing too connected with this affair that seemed to
prove conclusively, that the suspicions heretofore harboured against
the captain were unjust.And that was the report brought by the crew of a fishing smack, that
they had seen a schooner answering to the description given of the
pirate, just before this horrible occurrence took place.Captain Flint now assumed the bearing of a man whose fair fame had
been purified of some foul blot stain that had been unjustly cast upon
it, one who had been honorably acquitted of base charges brought
against him by enemies who had sought his ruin.He had not been ignorant, he said, of the dark suspicions that had
been thrown out against him.But he had trusted to time to vindicate his character, and he had not
trusted in vain.Among the first to congratulate Captain Flint on his escape from the
danger with which he had been threatened, was Carl Rosenthrall.He admitted that he had been to some extent, tainted with suspicion,
in common with others, for which he now asked his forgiveness.The pardon was of course granted by the captain, coupled with hope
that he would not be so easily led away another time.The facts in regard to this last diabolical act of the pirates were
these.Captain Flint, in accordance with the plan which he had decided upon,
and with which the reader has already been made acquainted, fitted out
a small fishing vessel, manned by some of the most desperate of his
crew, and commanded by the Parson and Old Ropes.Most of the men went on board secretly at night, only three men
appearing on deck when she set sail.In fact, no one to look at her, would take her for anything but an
ordinary fishing smack.They had not been out long, before they came in sight of a vessel
which they thought would answer their purpose.It was a small brig
engaged in trading along the coast, and such a vessel as under
ordinary circumstances they would hardly think worth noticing.But
their object was not plunder this time, but simply to do something
that would shield them from the danger that threatened them on shore.The time seemed to favor them, for the night was closing in and there
were no other vessels in sight.On the pirates making a signal of distress, the commander of the brig
brought his vessel to, until the boat from the supposed smack could
reach him, and the crew could make their wants known.To his surprise six men fully armed sprang upon his deck.To resist this force there were only himself, and two men, all
unarmed.Of these the pirates made short work not deigning to answer the
questions put to them by their unfortunate victims.When they had murdered all on board, and thrown overboard such of the
cargo as they did not want they abandoned the brig, knowing from the
direction of the wind, and the state of the tide, that she would soon
drift on the beach, and the condition in which she would be found,
would lead people to believe that she had been boarded by pirates, and
all on board put to death.After having accomplished this hellish act, they turned their course
homeward, bringing the report that they had seen the notorious
piratical schooner which had committed so many horrible depredations,
leading every one to conclude that this was another of her terrible
deeds.Captain Flint, satisfied with the result of this last achievement,
felt himself secure for the present.He could now without fear of interruption, take time to mature his
plans for carrying out his next grand enterprise, which was to be the
crowning one of all his adventures, and which was to enrich all
engaged in it.Captain Flint's plan for the accomplishment of his last grand
enterprise was, as soon as it should be announced to him by those he
had constantly on the lookout, that the expected vessel was in sight,
to embark in a large whale boat which he had secretly armed, and
fitted for the purpose.After killing the crew of the vessel they expected to capture, he
would tack about ship, and take her into some port where he could
dispose of the vessel and cargo.As, in this case, it was his intention to abandon the country for
ever, he removed under various pretences, all his most valuable
property from the cavern.The schooner he was to leave in charge of Jones Bradley, under
pretence that it was necessary to do so, in order to divert suspicion
from him when the thing should have been accomplished.The fact was, that as he should have no further use for the schooner,
and having for some time past, feared that Bradley seemed to be too
tender-hearted to answer his purpose, he had determined to abandon him
and the schooner together.At last, news was brought to Captain Flint that a vessel answering the
one they were expecting was in sight.Flint who, with his crew of desperators, was lying at a place now
known as Sandy Hook, immediately started in pursuit.The doomed ship was making her
way under a light breeze apparently unconscious of danger.There was one thing about the ship, that struck the pirates as rather
unusual.There seemed to be more hands on board than were required to
man such a vessel."I'm afraid there's more work for us than we've bargained for," said
one of the men."They seem to have a few passengers on board," remarked Flint, "but we
can soon dispose of them."The principal part of Flint's men had stretched themselves on the
bottom of the boat for fear of exciting the suspicion of those on
board the ship by their numbers.As the pirate craft approached the merchant man, apparently with no
hostile intention, those on board the ship were watching the boat as
closely as they were themselves watched.As soon as they came within hailing distance, the man at the bow of
the boat notified the captain of the ship that he wished to come along
side, as he had something of importance to communicate.The captain of the ship commenced apparently making preparations to
receive the visit, when one of the men on deck who had been observing
the boat for some time came to him and said:

"That's he.The man on the bow of the
boat is the notorious pirate Flint."In a moment more they would be along side, and nothing could prevent
them from boarding the ship.In that moment the captain of the ship, by a skilful movement suddenly
tacked his vessel about just as the pirates came up, coming in contact
with the boat in such a manner as to split her in two in a moment.A dozen men sprung up from the bottom of the boat, uttering horrid
curses while they endeavored to reach the ship or cling to portions of
their shattered boat.The greater portion of them were drowned, as no efforts were made to
rescue them.Three only succeeded in reaching the deck of the ship in safety, and
these would probably have rather followed their comrades had they
known how few were going to escape.These three were Captain Flint, the one called the Parson and Old
Ropes.These were at first disposed to show fight, but it was of no use.Their arms had been lost in their struggle in the water.They were soon overpowered and put in irons.Great was the excitement caused in the goodly little City of New York,
by the arrival of the merchant ship bringing as prisoners, the daring
pirate with two of his men whose fearful deeds had caused all the
inhabitants of the land to thrill with horror.And great was the surprise of the citizens to find in that terrible
pirate a well-known member of the community, and one whom nearly all
regarded as a worthy member of society.Another cause of surprise to the good people of the city, was the
arrival by this vessel, of one whom all had long given up as lost, and
that was Henry Billings, the lover of Hellena Rosenthrall.He it was who had recognized in the commander of the whale boat, the
pirate Flint, and had warned the captain of the ship of his danger,
thereby enabling him to save his vessel, and the lives of all on
board.Captain Flint made a slight mistake when he took the vessel by which
he was run down, for the India man he was looking out for.It was an
ordinary merchant ship from Amsterdam, freighted with merchandise from
that port.Though in appearance she very much resembled the vessel
which Captain Flint had taken her for.The reason young Billings happened to be on board of her was this:

It will be remembered that when the ship in which Billings had taken
passage for Europe, was attacked by the pirates, he was forced to walk
the plank.By the pirates, he was of course supposed to have been drowned, but in
this they were mistaken.He had been in the water but a few moments
when he came in contact with a portion of a spar which had probably
come from some wreck or had been washed off of some vessel.To this he lashed himself with a large handkerchief which it was his
good fortune to have at the time.Lashed to this spar he passed the night.When morning came he found that he had drifted out to sea; he could
not tell how far.He was out of sight of land, and no sail met his anxious gaze.His strength was nearly exhausted, and he felt a stupor coming over
him.How long he lay in this condition he could not tell.When he came to
himself, he found that he was lying in the birth of a vessel, while a
sailor was standing at his side.He had been discovered by the Captain of a ship bound for England,
from Boston.He had been taken on board, in an almost lifeless condition, and
kindly cared for.In a little while he recovered his usual strength, and although his
return home must necessarily be delayed, he trusted to be enabled
before a great while to do so and bring to justice the villains who
had attempted his murder.Unfortunately the vessel by which he had been rescued, was wrecked on
the coast of Ireland, he and the crew barely escaping with their
lives.After a while, he succeeded in getting to England by working his
passage there.From London, he made his way in the same manner, to Amsterdam, where
the mercantile house with which he was connected being known, he found
no difficulty in securing a passage for New York.Billings now for the first time heard the story of Hellena's
mysterious disappearance.It immediately occurred to him that Captain Flint was some way
concerned in the affair not withstanding his positive denial that he
knew anything of the matter further than he had already made known.The capture of Captain Flint, and the other two pirates of course led
to the arrest of Jones Bradley who had been left in charge of the
schooner.He was found on board of the vessel, which was lying a short distance
up the river, and arrested before he had learned the fate of his
comrades.He was cast into prison with the rest, though each occupied a separate
cell.As no good reason could be given for delaying the punishment of the
prisoners, their trial was commenced immediately.The evidence against them was too clear to make a long trial
necessary.They were all condemned to death with the exception of Jones Bradley,
whose punishment on account of his not engaged in last affair, and
having recommended mercy in the case of Henry Billings, was committed
to imprisonment for life.When the time came for the carrying out of sentence of the three who
had been condemned to death, it was found that one of them was missing
and that one, the greatest villain of them all, Captain Flint himself!No one had visited him on the previous
day but Carl Rosenthrall, and he was a magistrate, and surely he would
be the last one to aid in the escape of a prisoner!That he was gone however, was a fact.But If it were a fact that he had made his escape, it was equally
true, that he could not have gone very far, and the community were not
in the humor to let such a desperate character as he was now known to
be, escape without making a strenuous effort to recapture him.The execution of the two who had been sentenced to die at the same
time, was delayed for a few days in the hope of learning from them,
the places where Flint would most probably fly to, but they maintained
a sullen silence on the subject.They then applied to Jones Bradley with, at first, no better result.But when Henry Billings, who was one of those appointed to visit him,
happened to allude to the strange fate of Hellena Rosenthrall, he
hesitated a moment, and then said he knew where the girl was, and that
she had been captured by Captain Flint, and kept in close confinement
by him.He had no wish he said to betray his old commander, though he knew
that he had been treated badly by him, but he would like to save the
young woman.Captain Flint might be in the same place, but if he was, he thought
that he would kill the girl sooner than give her up.If Captain Flint, was not there, the only ones in the cave besides the
girl, were a squaw, and Captain Flint's <DW64> boy, Bill.For the sake of the girl Bradley said he would guide a party to the
cave.This offer was at once accepted, and a party well armed, headed by
young Billings, and guided by Jones Bradley, set out immediately.When Captain Flint made his escape from prison, it naturally enough
occurred to him, that the safest place for him for awhile, would be
the cave.In it he thought he could remain in perfect safety, until he should
find an opportunity for leaving the country.The cave, or at least the secret chamber, was unknown to any except
his crew, and those who were confined in it.On leaving the cave, the last time, with a heartlessness worthy a
demon, he had barred the entrance to the cavern on the outside, so as
to render it impossible for those confined there to escape in that
direction.In fact, he had, be supposed, buried them alive--left them to die of
hunger.Captain Flint reached the entrance of the cave in safety, and found
everything as he had left it.On reaching the inner chamber where he had left the two women and the
<DW64> boy, he was startled to find the place apparently deserted,
while all was in total darkness, except where a few rays found their
way through the crevices of the rocks.He called the names first of one, and then another, but the only
answer he received was the echo of his own voice.They certainly could not have made their escape, for the fastenings
were all as he had left them.The means of striking fire were at hand, and a lamp was soon lighted.He searched the cave, but could discover no trace of the missing ones.A strange horror came over him, such as he had never felt before.The stillness oppressed him; no living enemy could have inspired him
with the fear he now felt from being alone in this gloomy cavern."I must leave this place," he said, "I would rather be in prison than
here."Again he took up the lamp, and went round the cave, but more this time
in hopes of finding some weapon to defend himself with, in case he
should be attacked, than with the hope of discovering the manner in
which those he had left there had contrived to make their escape.It had been his custom, lately, on leaving the cavern, to take his
weapons with him, not knowing what use might be made of them by the
women under the provocation, to which they were sometimes subjected.The only weapon he could find was a large dagger.This he secured, and
was preparing to leave the cavern, when he thought he saw something
moving in one corner.In order to make sure that he had not been mistaken, he approached the
place.It was a corner where a quantity of skins had been thrown, and which
it had not been convenient for him to remove, when he left the cavern.Thinking that one of these skins might be of service to him in the
life he would be obliged to live for some time, he commenced sorting
them over, for the purpose of finding one that would answer his
purpose, when a figure suddenly sprang up from the pile.It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more frightened."Dat you, massa," at length exclaimed the familiar voice of Black
Bill."I tought it was de debil come back agin to carry me off."said Flint, greatly relieved, and glad to
find some one who could explain the strange disappearance of Hellena
and Lightfoot.he asked; "where's the white girl and the
Indian woman?""Debble carry dim off," said Bill."What do you mean, you black fool?"said his master; "if you don't
tell me where they've gone, I'll break your black skull for you.""Don't know where dar gone," said Bill, tremblingly, "Only know dat de
debble take dem away."Flint finding that he was not likely to get anything out of the boy by
frightening him, now changed his manner, saying;

"Never mind, Bill, let's hear all about it."The boy reassured, now told his master that the night before while he
was lying awake near the pile of skins and the women were asleep, he
saw the walls of the cavern divide and a figure holding a blazing
torch such as he had never seen before, enter the room."I tought," said Bill, "dat it was de debble comin' arter you agin,
massa, and I was 'fraid he would take me along, so I crawled under de
skins, but I made a hole so dat I could watch what he was doin'.""He looked all round a spell for you, massa, an' when he couldn't find
you, den he went were de women was sleepin' an woke dem up and made
dem follow him."Den da called me and looked all ober for me an' couldn't find me, an'
de debble said he couldn't wait no longer, an' dat he would come for
me annudder time, An den de walls opened agin, an' da all went true
togedder.When I heard you in de cave, massa, I tought it was de
debble come agin to fetch me, an' so I crawled under de skins agin."From this statement of the boy, Flint come to the conclusion that Bill
must have been too much frightened at the time to know what was
actually taking place.One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had
been aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most
strange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the
same result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass
out through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,
for he found everything as he had left it.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled
and disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell
of enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in
the manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was
telling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even
though a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the
feeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon
entering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,
before taking his departure.This determination of Captain Flint's was by no means agreeable to the
<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the
clutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him
that he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the
captain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of
the cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day
passed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his
appearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the
cave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and
not to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,
however, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it
at all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no
disposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards
him, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much
longer, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go
in search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the
others to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was
barred against her from the outside.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of
the captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they
immediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by
that means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,
and endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold
ring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain
Flint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look
at it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by
her lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was
satisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden
disappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this
villain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now
desirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time
before sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when
Hellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure
she had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a
spectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, "has the little paleface
maiden forgotten; no, no!"she recognized in the intruder, her old
friend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing
her arms around the old chief, exclaimed:

"Save me, no, no, save me!"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the
appearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she
had expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a
place of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in
charge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And
she recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He
was also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with
all the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and
bade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for
the first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to
perish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was
called to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go
without him, the chief promising to return and make another search for
him, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under
the pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might
be called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,
and stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a
sudden pressure, when a portion of the wall moved aside, disclosing a
passage, till then unknown to all except Fire Cloud himself.It was
one of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the
purpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed
after him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could
not see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over
the difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path
widening until it might be called another cavern, and then again
becoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they
suddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter's wand could
open the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the
passage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower
part, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and
making an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves
in the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one
unacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking
rock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the
mountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of
Indian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his
own hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find
herself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white
face to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a
stranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found
herself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling
himself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately
escaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to
persuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for
passing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in
sleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern
was the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would
certainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this
he would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him
also, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the
loud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast
asleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had
thrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the
captain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the
table, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards
the entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,
and the fastening could be easily removed.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit
of boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may
come arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain't a goun to ketch
dis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de
sea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might
be overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further
into the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the
devil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his
slumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a
crevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as
we have said had been carried off by the <DW64>."Hello, there, Bill, you black imp," shouted the captain, "bring a
light."But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times
repeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he
always kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place
of the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought
to have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in
silence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy
place, once more came over him."Who knows," he thought, "but this black imp may betray me into the
hands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his
power to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on
the outside, bury me alive!"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the
cavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard
the sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in
order to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,
who seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man
his old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the
cave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and
reconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of
everything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,
when Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, "So it's you, you
traitor, who has betrayed me," at the same moment plunging his dagger
in the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several
shots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the
advantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon
hidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident
that his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the
unfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,
and they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them
stumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang
Black Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had
discovered that he was among friends."Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?""Gone dat way, and a-runnin' as if de debble was arter him, an' I
guess he is, too."The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a
precipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low
growl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to
shrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were
in pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from
wounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?"De debble got him now," said Black Bill, and the whole party took
their way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in
company with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to
their coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the
devil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,
that they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his
mind not to return to the city, until he had learned something
definite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages
belonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had
come up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,
for the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,
occupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of
canoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt
to avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the
savages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to
trade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced
endeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their
astonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their
prisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their
course down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke
English tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that
he was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape
they had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and
they thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as
to bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of
their mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was
of no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently
his arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they
had made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for
having performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and
reproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And
Billings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left
for him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of
success were greatly against him this time, on account of the time
that had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this
delay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,
now came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing
maiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the
streams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while
traveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was
gladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered
to accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the
protection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must
travel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under
such a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian
country, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred
worth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the
remainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was
the residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father
of Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure
and disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted
in the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was
answered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of
his Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a
single canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of
Old Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man
somewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian
woman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,
Lightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,
but not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or
otherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being
delayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have
saved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her
father and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never
expected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena's happiness would now have been complete, had it
not been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled
by without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was
fast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the
one for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her
wonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did
we not think that justice to the reader, required that we should
explain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet
accounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she
had seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but
we have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so
alarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a
recess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>'s bed, there was a deep
fissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,
to amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,
when to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and
over, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,
which came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the
wall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of
times, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed
it to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, "The debil comin' after master," and repeated it a
great many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had
been talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,
Bill was lying awake, listening to the captain's story.When he came
to the part where he describes the throwing the boy's father
overboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the
crevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in
his memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had
learned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm
was caused by Fire Cloud after his visit to the cave on the occasion
that he had been taken for the devil by Bill, and an Indian ghost by
Hellena.Fire Cloud had remained in another chamber of the cavern connected
with the secret passage already described, and where the echo was even
more wonderful than the one pronounced from the opening through which
the <DW64> had spoken.Here he could hear all that was passing in the great chamber occupied
by the pirates, and from this chamber the echoes were to those who did
not understand their cause, perfectly frightful.All these peculiarities of the cavern had been known to the ancient
Indian priests or medicine men, and by them made use of to impose on
their ignorant followers.BEADLE'S FRONTIER SERIES
