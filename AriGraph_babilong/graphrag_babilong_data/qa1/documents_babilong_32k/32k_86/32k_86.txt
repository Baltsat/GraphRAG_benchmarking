One thing was certain, and that was the prisoners had escaped, and had
been aided in their escape by some persons, to him unknown, in a most
strange and mysterious manner.Over and over again he questioned Black Bill, but every time with the
same result.The boy persisted in the statement, that he saw the whole party pass
out through an opening in the walls of the cavern.That they had not passed out through the usual entrance was evident,
for he found everything as he had left it.Again he examined the walls of the cavern, only to be again baffled
and disappointed.He began to think that may be after all, the cavern was under a spell
of enchantment, and that the women had actually been carried off in
the manner described by the <DW64>.The boy was evidently honest in his statement, believing that he was
telling nothing that was not true.But be all this as it might, the mere presence of a human being, even
though a poor <DW64> boy, was sufficient to enable him to shake off the
feeling of loneliness and fear, with which he was oppressed upon
entering the cavern.He now determined to remain in the cavern for a short time.Long enough at least to make a thorough examination of the place,
before taking his departure.This determination of Captain Flint's was by no means agreeable to the
<DW64> boy.Bill was anxious to leave the cave, and by that means escape the
clutches of the devil, who was in the habit of frequenting it.He endeavored to induce Flint to change his resolution by assuring him
that he had heard the devil say that he was coming after him.But the
captain only laughed at the boy, and he was compelled to remain.For several days after the departure of Captain Flint, the inmates of
the cavern felt no uneasiness at his absence; but when day after day
passed, until more than a week had elapsed without his making his
appearance they began to be alarmed.It had uniformly been the practice of Captain Flint on leaving the
cave, to give Lightfoot charges to remain there until his return, and
not to allow any one to enter, or pass out during his absence.Singularly enough he had said nothing about it the last time.This,
however, made no difference with Lightfoot, for if she thought of it
at all, she supposed that he had forgotten it.Still she felt no
disposition to disobey his commands, although her feelings towards
him, since his late brutal treatment had very much changed.But their provisions were giving out, and to remain in the cavern much
longer, they must starve to death.Lightfoot therefore resolved to go
in search of the means of preventing such a catastrophe, leaving the
others to remain in the cave until her return.On attempting to pass out, she found to her horror that the way was
barred against her from the outside.In vain she endeavored to force her way out.There seemed to be no alternative but to await patiently the return of
the captain.Failing in that, they must starve to death!Their supply of provisions was not yet quite exhausted, and they
immediately commenced putting themselves on short allowance, hoping by
that means to make them last until relief should come.While the two women were sitting together, talking over the matter,
and endeavoring to comfort each other, Hellena noticing the plain gold
ring on the finger of Lightfoot, that had been placed there by Captain
Flint during her quarrel with the Indian, asked to be allowed to look
at it.On examining the ring, she at once recognized it as the one worn by
her lost lover.Her suspicions in regard to Flint were now fully confirmed.She was
satisfied that he was in some way concerned in the sudden
disappearance of the missing man.Could it be possible that he had been put out of the way by this
villain, who, for some reason unknown to any but himself, was now
desirous of disposing of her also?That night the two women retired to rest as usual.It was a long time
before sleep came to their relief.The clock which the pirates had hung in the cave, struck twelve, when
Hellena started from her slumber with a suppressed cry, for the figure
she had seen in the vision many nights ago, stood bending over her!But now it looked more like a being of real flesh and blood, than a
spectre.And when it spoke to her, saying, "has the little paleface
maiden forgotten; no, no!"she recognized in the intruder, her old
friend the Indian chief, Fire Cloud.Hellena, the feelings of childhood returning, sprang up, and throwing
her arms around the old chief, exclaimed:

"Save me, no, no, save me!"Lightfoot was by this time awake also, and on her feet.To her the
appearance of the chief seemed a matter of no surprise.Not that she
had expected anything of the kind, but she looked upon the cave as a
place of enchantment, and she believed that the spirits having it in
charge, could cause the walls to open and close again at pleasure.And
she recognized Fire Cloud as one of the chiefs of her own tribe.He
was also a descendant of one of its priests, and was acquainted with
all the mysteries of the cavern.He told the prisoners that he had come to set them at liberty, and
bade them follow.They had got everything for their departure, when they observed for
the first time that Black Bill was missing.They could not think of going without him, leaving him there to
perish, but the cavern was searched for him in vain.His name was
called to no better purpose, till they were at last compelled to go
without him, the chief promising to return and make another search for
him, all of which was heard by the <DW64> from his hiding place under
the pile of skins as related in the preceding chapter.The chief, to the surprise of Hellena, instead of going to what might
be called the door of the cavern, went to one of the remote corners,
and stooping down, laid hold of a projection of rock, and gave it a
sudden pressure, when a portion of the wall moved aside, disclosing a
passage, till then unknown to all except Fire Cloud himself.It was
one of the contrivances of the priests of the olden time, for the
purpose of imposing upon the ignorant and superstitious multitude.On passing through this opening, which the chief carefully closed
after him, the party entered a narrow passageway, leading they could
not see where, nor how far.The Indian led the way, carrying his torch, and assisting them over
the difficulties of the way, when assistance was required.Thus he led them on, over rocks, and precipices, sometimes the path
widening until it might be called another cavern, and then again
becoming so narrow as to only allow one to pass at a time.Thus they journeyed on for the better part of a mile, when they
suddenly came to a full stop.It seemed to Hellena that nothing short of an enchanter's wand could
open the way for them now, when Fire Cloud, going to the end of the
passage, gave a large slab which formed the wall a push on the lower
part, causing it to rise as if balanced by pivots at the center, and
making an opening through which the party passed, finding themselves
in the open air, with the stars shining brightly overhead.As soon as they had passed out the rock swung back again, and no one
unacquainted with the fact, would have supposed that common looking
rock to be the door of the passage leading to the mysterious cavern.The place to which they now came, was a narrow valley between the
mountains.Pursuing their journey up this valley, they came to a collection of
Indian wigwams, and here they halted, the chief showing them into his
own hut, which was one of the group.Another time, it would have alarmed Hellena Rosenthrall to find
herself in the wilderness surrounded by savages.But now, although among savages far away from home, without a white
face to look upon, she felt a degree of security, she had long been a
stranger to.In fact she felt that the Indians under whose protection she now found
herself, were far more human, far less cruel, than the demon calling
himself a white man, out of whose hands she had so fortunately
escaped.For once since her capture, her sleep was quiet, and refreshing.Black Bill, on leaving the captain, after having vainly endeavored to
persuade him to leave the cave, crawled in to his usual place for
passing the night, but not with the hope of forgetting his troubles in
sleep.He was more firmly than ever impressed with the idea that the cavern
was the resort of the Devil and his imps, and that they would
certainly return for the purpose of carrying off his master.To this
he would have no objection, did he not fear that they might nab him
also, in order to keep his master company.So when everything was perfectly still in the cavern excepting the
loud breathing of the captain, which gave evidence of his being fast
asleep, the <DW64> crept cautiously out of the recess, where he had
thrown himself down, and moved noiselessly to the place where the
captain was lying.Having satisfied himself that his master was asleep, he went to the
table, and taking the lamp that was burning there, he moved towards
the entrance of the cave.This was now fastened only on the inside,
and the fastening could be easily removed.In a few moments Black Bill was at liberty.As soon as he felt himself free from the cave, he gave vent to a fit
of boisterous delight, exclaiming.Now de debile may
come arter massa Flint as soon as he please, he ain't a goun to ketch
dis chile, I reckan.Serb de captain right for trowin my fadder in de
sea.Thus he went on until the thought seeming to strike him that he might
be overheard, and pursued, he stopped all at once, and crept further
into the forest and as he thought further out of the reach of the
devil.The morning had far advanced when captain Flint awoke from his
slumber.He knew this from the few sunbeams that found their way through a
crevice in the rocks at one corner of the cave.With this exception the place was in total darkness, for the lamp as
we have said had been carried off by the <DW64>."Hello, there, Bill, you black imp," shouted the captain, "bring a
light."But Bill made no answer, although the command was several times
repeated.At last, Flint, in a rage, sprang up, and seizing a raw hide which he
always kept handy for such emergencies, he went to the sleeping place
of the <DW64>, and struck a violent blow on the place where Bill ought
to have been, but where Bill was not.Flint went back, and for a few moments sat down by the table in
silence.After awhile the horror at being alone in such a gloomy
place, once more came over him."Who knows," he thought, "but this black imp may betray me into the
hands of my enemies.Even he, should he be so disposed, has it in his
power to come at night, and by fastening the entrance of the cavern on
the outside, bury me alive!"So Flint reasoned, and so reasoning, made up his mind to leave the
cavern.Flint had barely passed beyond the entrance of the cave, when he heard
the sound of approaching footsteps.He crouched under the bushes in
order to watch and listen.He saw a party of six men approaching, all fully armed excepting one,
who seemed to be a guide to the rest.Flint fairly gnashed his teeth with rage as he recognised in this man
his old associate--Jones Bradley.The whole party halted at a little distance from the entrance to the
cave, where Bradley desired them to remain while he should go and
reconnoitre.He had reached the entrance, had made a careful examination of
everything about it, and was in the act of turning to make his report,
when Flint sprang upon him from the bushes, saying, "So it's you, you
traitor, who has betrayed me," at the same moment plunging his dagger
in the breast of Bradley, who fell dead at his feet.In the next moment the pirate was flying through the forest.Several
shots were fired at him, but without any apparent effect.But the pirate having the
advantage of a start and a better knowledge of the ground, was soon
hidden from view in the intricacies of the forest.Still the party continued their pursuit, led now by Henry Billings.As the pirate did not return the fire of his pursuers, it was evident
that his only weapon was the dagger with which he had killed the
unfortunate Bradley.For several hours they continued their search, but all to no purpose,
and they were about to give it up for the present, when one of them
stumbled, and fell over something buried in the grass, when up sprang
Black Bill, who had hidden there on hearing the approach of the party.asked the boy, as soon as he had
discovered that he was among friends."Yes; can you tell us which way he has gone?""Gone dat way, and a-runnin' as if de debble was arter him, an' I
guess he is, too."Daniel went to the office.The party set off in the direction pointed out, the <DW64> following.After going about half a mile, they were brought to a full stop by a
precipice over which the foremost one of the party was near falling.As they came to the brink they thought they heard a whine and a low
growl, as of a wild animal in distress.Looking into the ravine, a sight met their gaze, which caused them to
shrink back with horror.At the bottom of the ravine lay the body of the man of whom they were
in pursuit, but literally torn to pieces.Beside the body crouched an enormous she bear, apparently dying from
wounds she had received from an encounter with the men.Could his worst enemy have wished him a severe punishment?"De debble got him now," said Black Bill, and the whole party took
their way back to the cave.On their way back, Billings learned from the <DW64> that Hellena in
company with Lightfoot, had left the cave several days previous to
their coming.He was so possessed with the idea they had been spirited away by the
devil, or some one of his imps in the shape of an enormous Indian,
that they thought he must have been frightened out of his wits.Billings was at a loss what course to take, but he had made up his
mind not to return to the city, until he had learned something
definite in relation to the fate of his intended bride.In all probability, she was at some one of the Indian villages
belonging to some of the tribes occupying that part of the country.For this purpose he embarked again in the small vessel in which he had
come up the river, intending to proceed a short distance further up,
for the purpose of consulting an old chief who, with his family,
occupied a small island situated there.He had proceeded but a short distance when he saw a large fleet of
canoes approaching.Supposing them to belong to friendly Indians, Billings made no attempt
to avoid them, and his boat was in a few moments surrounded by the
savages.At first the Indians appeared to be perfectly friendly, offering to
trade and, seeming particularly anxious to purchase fire-arms.This aroused the suspicions of the white men, and they commenced
endeavoring to get rid of their troublesome visitors, when to their
astonishment, they were informed that they were prisoners!Billings was surprised to find that the Indians, after securing their
prisoners, instead of starting up the river again, continued their
course down the stream.But what he learned shortly after from one of the Indians, who spoke
English tolerably well, astonished him still more.And that was, that
he was taken for the notorious pirate Captain Flint, of whose escape
they had heard from some of their friends recently from the city, and
they thought that nothing would please their white brethren so much as
to bring him back captive.It was to no purpose that Billings endeavored to convince them of
their mistake.They only shook their heads, as much as to say it was
of no use, they were not to be so easily imposed upon.And so Billings saw there was no help for it but to await patiently
his arrival at New York, when all would be set right again.But in the meantime Hellena might be removed far beyond his reach.Great was the mortification in the city upon learning the mistake they
had made.Where they had expected to receive praise and a handsome reward for
having performed a meritorious action, they obtained only censure and
reproaches for meddling in matters that did not concern them.It was only a mistake however, and there was no help for it.And
Billings, although greatly vexed and disappointed, saw no course left
for him but to set off again, although he feared that the chances of
success were greatly against him this time, on account of the time
that had been lost.The Indians, whose unfortunate blunder had been the cause of this
delay, in order to make some amends for the wrong they had done him,
now came forward, and offered to aid him in his search for the missing
maiden.They proffered him the use of their canoes to enable him to ascend the
streams, and to furnish guides, and an escort to protect him while
traveling through the country.This offer, so much better than he had any reason to expect, was
gladly accepted by Billings, and with two friends who had volunteered
to accompany him, he once more started up the river, under the
protection of his new friends.War had broken out among the various tribes on the route which he must
travel, making it unsafe for him and his two companions, even under
such a guide and escort as his Indian friends could furnish them.Thus he with his two associates were detained so long in the Indian
country, that by their friends at home they were given up as lost.At last peace was restored, and they set out on their return.The journey home was a long and tedious one, but nothing occurred
worth narrating.Upon reaching the Hudson, they employed an Indian to take them the
remainder of the way in a canoe.Upon reaching Manhattan Island, the first place they stopped at was
the residence of Carl Rosenthrall, Billings intending that the father
of Hellena should be the first to hear the sad story of his failure
and disappointment.It was evening when he arrived at the house and the lamps were lighted
in the parlor.With heavy heart and trembling hands he rapped at the door.As the door opened he uttered a faint cry of surprise, which was
answered by a similar one by the person who admitted him.The scene that followed we shall not attempt to describe.At about the same time that Henry Billings, under the protection of
his Indian friends, set out on his last expedition up the river, a
single canoe with four persons in it, put out from under the shadow of
Old Crow Nest, on its way down the stream.The individual by whom the canoe was directed was an Indian, a man
somewhat advanced in years.The others were a white girl, an Indian
woman, and a <DW64> boy.In short, the party consisted of Fire Cloud, Hellena Rosenthrall,
Lightfoot, and Black Bill, on their way to the city.They had passed the fleet of canoes in which Billings had embarked,
but not knowing whether it belonged to a party of friendly Indians or
otherwise.Fire Cloud had avoided coming in contact with it for fear of being
delayed, or of the party being made prisoners and carried back again.Could they have but met, what a world of trouble would it not have
saved to all parties interested!As it was, Hellena arrived in safety, greatly to the delight of her
father and friends, who had long mourned for her as for one they never
expected to see again in this world.The sum of Hellena's happiness would now have been complete, had it
not been for the dark shadow cast over it by the absence of her lover.And this shadow grew darker, and darker, as weeks, and months, rolled
by without bringing any tidings of the missing one.What might have been the effects of the melancholy into which she was
fast sinking, it is hard to tell, had not the unexpected return of the
one for whose loss she was grieving, restored her once more to her
wonted health and spirits.And here we might lay down our pen, and call our story finished, did
we not think that justice to the reader, required that we should
explain some things connected with the mysterious, cavern not yet
accounted for.How the Indian entered the cave on the night when Hellena fancied she
had seen a ghost, and how she made her escape, has been explained, but
we have not yet explained how the noises were produced which so
alarmed the pirates.It will be remembered that the sleeping place of Black Bill was a
recess in the wall of the cavern.Now in the wall, near the head of the <DW64>'s bed, there was a deep
fissure or crevice.It happened that Bill while lying awake one night,
to amuse himself, put his month to the crevice and spoke some words,
when to his astonishment, what he had said, was repeated over and
over, again.Black Bill in his ignorance and simplicity, supposed that the echo,
which came back, was an answer from some one on the other side of the
wall.Having made this discovery, he repeated the experiment a number of
times, and always with the same result.After awhile, he began to ask questions of the spirit, as he supposed
it to be, that had spoken to him.Among other things he asked if the devil was coming after master.The echo replied, "The debil comin' after master," and repeated it a
great many times.Bill now became convinced that it was the devil himself that he had
been talking to.On the night when the pirates were so frightened by the fearful groan,
Bill was lying awake, listening to the captain's story.When he came
to the part where he describes the throwing the boy's father
overboard, and speaks of the horrible groan, Bill put his mouth to the
crevice, and imitated the groan, which had been too deeply fixed in
his memory ever to be forgotten, giving full scope to his voice.The effect astonished and frightened him as well as the pirates.With the same success he imitated the Indian war-whoop, which he had
learned while among the savages.The next time that the pirates were so terribly frightened, the alarm
was caused by Fire Cloud after his visit to the cave on the occasion
that he had been taken for the devil by Bill, and an Indian ghost by
Hellena.Fire Cloud had remained in another chamber of the cavern connected
with the secret passage already described, and where the echo was even
more wonderful than the one pronounced from the opening through which
the <DW64> had spoken.Here he could hear all that was passing in the great chamber occupied
by the pirates, and from this chamber the echoes were to those who did
not understand their cause, perfectly frightful.All these peculiarities of the cavern had been known to the ancient
Indian priests or medicine men, and by them made use of to impose on
their ignorant followers.BEADLE'S FRONTIER SERIES


    1.Wapawkaneta, or the Rangers of the Oneida.Scar-Cheek, the Wild Half-Breed.Red Rattlesnake, The Pawnee.THE ARTHUR WESTBROOK CO.Cleveland, U.S.A."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

ACT I.

AT THE DEANERY, ST.Scene 1:--"_The Strong Box,_" _St.Scene 2.--The Deanery again._

The curtain will be lowered for a few minutes between the two scenes.Preceded, at Eight o'clock, by

"THE NETTLE."An Original Comedietta by ERNEST WARREN."Dandy Dick" was performed 171 times between the first night and the
22d of July, when, the old theatre being demolished, Mr.Clayton took
a temporary lease of Toole's Theatre, and transferred the play
thither, where it ran 75 nights more.A company had already been sent out, under the auspices of the Court
management, to perform "Dandy Dick" in the provinces; but, when the
play was withdrawn from the London boards, Mr.Mary travelled to the garden.Clayton set out himself
with a company, and it was during this tour that he died at Liverpool.Daly produced "Dandy Dick" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs.John Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in
Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it ran for quite an
unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney.In the character of the
Dean, Mr.G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian
successes, and Mr.Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman._The morning-room in the Deanery of St.Marvells, with a large arched
opening leading to the library on the right, and a deeply-recessed
window opening out to the garden on the left.It is a bright spring
morning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._

_SALOME, a tall, handsome, dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is
sitting with her elbows resting on her knees, staring wildly into
vacancy.SHEBA, a fair little girl of about seventeen, wearing short
petticoats, shares her despondency, and lies prostrate upon the
settee._

SALOME.[_Sitting upright._] Oh, my gracious goodness, goodness gracious me![_They both walk about excitedly._

SALOME.There's only one terrible word for it--it's a fix!How did _we_ get led into it?It was Major Tarver's proposal, and I believe, Salome, that it is to
_you_ Major Tarver is paying attention.The Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone is promoted by the Officers
of the Hussars.I believe that the young gentleman you have impressed
calls himself an officer, though he is merely a lieutenant.Darbey is _certainly_ an officer--a small
officer.How dare you gird at me, Salome?When to-night we appear at the Durnstone Athenaeum,
unknown to dear Papa, on the arms of Major Tarver and Mr.Darbey, I
consider that we shall be equally wicked.We're only _going_ to be wrong; that's a
very different matter.Besides, there's this to remember--we're inexperienced
girls and have only dear Papa.But oh, now that the Ball is to-night,
I repent, Sheba, I repent!I sha'n't do that till to-morrow.But oh, how I _shall_ repent
to-morrow![_Taking an envelope from her pocket, and almost crying._] You'd
repent now if you had seen the account for the fancy dresses.Yes, the Major enclosed it to me this morning.You know, Sheba, Major
Tarver promised to get the dresses made in London, so I gave him our
brown paper patterns to send to the _costumier._

SHEBA.[_Shocked._] Oh, Salome, do you think he quizzed them?No; I sealed them up and marked outside "To be opened only by a lady."I hate the plan of myself in brown paper.Well, of course Major Tarver begged to be allowed to pay for the
dresses, and I said I couldn't dream of permitting it, and then he
said he should be most unhappy if he didn't, and, just as I thought he
was going to have his own way, [_bursting into tears_] he cheered up
and said he'd yield to a lady.[_Taking a large account from the
envelope._] And oh![_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, _Costumier_ to the Queen, Bow
Street.One gown--period French Revolution, 1798--Fifteen guineas!"[_Sinking on her knees, clutching the table._] Oh!"Trimmings, linings, buttons, frillings--Seven guineas!"[_Putting her fingers into her ears._] Now for mine, oooh![_Reading._] "One skirt and bodice--flower girl--period uncertain--Ten
guineas.""Trimmings, linings, buttons, frillings--Five guineas!Ladies' own brown paper
patterns mislaid.[_They throw themselves into each other's arms._

SALOME.If we were only a few years older I should suggest that we wrote nice
notes to Papa and committed suicide.Brought up as we have been, that's out of the question!Then let us be brave women and wear the dresses!Of course we'll do that, but--the bill!We must get dear Papa in a good humor and coax him to make us a
present of money.He knows we haven't been charitable in the town for
ever so long.He hasn't paid our proper dressmaker's bill yet, and
I'm sure he's pressed for money.But we can't help that when _we're_ pressed for money--poor dear Papa!Suppose poor Papa refuses to give us a present?Then we must play the piano when he's at work on his Concordance--poor
dear Papa!However, don't let us wrong poor Papa in advance.Let us try to think
how nice we shall look.And as for stealing out of the house with Major Tarver
when poor dear Papa has gone to bed, why, Gerald Tarver would die for
me!So would Nugent Darbey for me; besides I'm not old enough to know
better.You're not so very much younger than I, Sheba!Then why do you keep me in short skirts?You know I can't lengthen you till I'm married![_BLORE, the butler, a venerable-looking person, with rather a
clerical suggestion about his dress, enters by the window._

BLORE.[_Benignly._] The two soldier gentlemen have just rode hup, Miss
Salome.[_The girls clutch each other's hands._

SALOME.Shall I show them hin, Miss Sheba?Yes, Blore, dear, and hang your h's on the hat-stand.[BLORE _laughs sweetly at SHEBA and shakes his fingers at her
playfully._

BLORE.[_Vindictively, behind their backs._] 'Ussies![_He goes out._

SALOME.[_Looking out at window._] Here they are!Sandra went to the kitchen.How well Gerald Tarver
dismounts!He left his liver in India, didn't he?And that he gave to his Queen, brave fellow![_Seating herself in an artificial attitude._] Where shall we
be--here?[_Running to the piano._] All right; you be admiring my voice!Here they are, and we're doing nothing!Let's run away and then come in unconsciously.BLORE shows in MAJOR TARVER and
MR.DARBEY, who are both in regimentals.MAJOR TARVER is a
middle-aged, tall, angular officer, with a thin face, yellow
complexion, and red eyes.He is alternately in a state of great
excitement and depression.DARBEY is a mere boy, but with a
pompous, patronizing manner._

DARBEY.The Dean's out of the way, eh!Never mind--perhaps Miss Jedd is at home?It would be discourteous to run away without asking Miss Jedd after
her father.[_Throwing himself on the settee._] Deuced bad form![_SALOME and SHEBA walk in together.SALOME has her arm round her
sister's waist and looks up to her with a sweet, trusting smile.They
start in confusion on seeing TARVER and DARBEY._

SALOME.[_Taking SALOME'S hand eagerly._] My dear Miss Jedd![_Rising and putting a glass to his eye._] Hah yah![_With her hand on her heart._] You quite startled us.[_In an agony of contrition._] Oh, did we?We never dreamt of finding two visitors for Papa.Why, you told me to show the gentlemen hin, Miss Sheba![_The two girls start guiltily and glare at BLORE._

SALOME.[_To himself._] Let 'em 'ang that on the 'atstand!DARBEY and SHEBA stroll together into the Library._

TARVER.[_To SALOME._] We thought we'd ride over directly after parade to make
the final arrangements for tonight.Yes, they came yesterday in a hamper labeled "Miss Jedd, Secretary,
Cast-off Clothing Distribution League."That was my idea--came to me in the middle of the night.Dear Major Tarver, surely this terrible strain on your nerves is very,
very bad for you with your--your----

TARVER.My liver--say the word, Miss Jedd.[_Drooping her head._] Oh, Major Tarver!Of course I'm excited now, and you see me
at my best, but the alternating fits of hopeless despondency are
shocking to witness and to endure!Oh, Miss Jedd, my forgetfulness has brought me--one of
my--terrible attacks--of depression![_She leads him to a chair into which he sinks in a ghastly state.DARBEY strolls in from the Library with SHEBA._

DARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] Your remarks about the army are extremely complimentary.We fellows are not a bad sort, take
us all round.There's a grand future before you, isn't there?Well, I suppose there is if I go on as I'm going now.[_To SALOME._] Thanks, the attack has passed.Now about to-night; at
what time is the house entirely quiet?Poor dear Papa goes round with Blore at half-past nine--after that all
is rest and peacefulness.Then if we're here with the closed carriage at ten--![_They go together into the library._

DARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] Some of us army men can slave too.Tarver's queer livah
has thrown all the arrangements for the Fancy Ball on my shoulders.[_SALOME and TARVER re-enter._] Look at him--that's when he's enjoying
life![_Laughing convulsively._] Ha!But suppose dear Papa should hear us crunching down the gravel path![_He sinks on to the settee with a vacant stare, his arms hanging
helplessly._

DARBEY.[_To SHEBA._] There--now his career is a burden to him!Would you like a glass of water, Major Tarver?[_Taking SALOME'S hand._] Thank you, dear Miss Jedd, with the least
suggestion of cayenne pepper in it.[_Looking out at window._] Oh, Salome![_They all collect themselves in a fluster.The two girls go to meet
their father, who enters at the window with his head bowed and his
hands behind his back, in deep thought.THE DEAN is a portly man of
about fifty, with a dignified demeanor, a suave voice and persuasive
manner, and a noble brow surmounted by silver-gray hair.BLORE follows
THE DEAN, carrying some books, a small bunch of flowers, and an
umbrella._

SALOME.[_THE DEAN rouses himself, discovers his children and removes his
hat._

THE DEAN.[_To SHEBA._] My toy-child![_He draws the
girls to him and embraces them, then sees TARVER and DARBEY._] Dear
me![_Coughing uncomfortably._] H'm![_Reproachfully, taking his hat from him._] Papa!Darbey have ridden over from Durnstone to ask how your cold is.[_SHEBA takes the gold-rimmed pince-nez which hangs upon THE DEAN'S
waistcoat and places it before his eyes._

THE DEAN.[_With his girls still embracing him he
extends a hand to each of the men._] My cold is better.[_BLORE goes
out through the Library._] Major--Mr.Garvey--these inquiries strike
me as being so kind that I insist--no, no, I _beg_ that you will share
our simple dinner with us to-night at six o'clock!Let me see--Tuesday night is----

SALOME.Thank you, toy-child--custards, cold.[_Looking to SALOME._] Well, I--ah--[_SALOME nods her head to him
violently._] That is, certainly, Dean, certainly.Delighted, my dear Dean--delighted![_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look, and with an important cough
walks into the Library.The men and the girls speak in undertones._

TARVER.[_Depressed._] Now, what will happen to-night?Why, don't you see, as you will have to drive over to dine, you will
both be here, on the spot, ready to take us back to Durnstone?[_THE DEAN sits at his desk in the Library._

DARBEY.Of course; when we're turned out we can hang about in the lane till
you're ready.Yes, but when are _we_ to make our preparations?It'll take me a long
time to look like Charles the First!We can drive about Durnstone while you dress.[_To TARVER, admiringly._] Charles the First!That was my idea--Charles the Martyr, you know.Tarver's a martyr to
his liver--see?[_They are all in a state of great excitement when THE DEAN re-enters,
with an anxious look, carrying a bundle of papers._

SALOME.[_They rush to various seats, all in constrained attitudes._

TARVER.[_To THE DEAN._] We waited to say--good-morning.[_Taking his hand, abstractedly._] How kind!Salome, represent me by escorting these gentlemen
to the gate.[_SALOME, TARVER, and DARBEY go out.SHEBA is following
slyly when THE DEAN looks up from his papers._] Sheba!Check me in a growing tendency to dislike Mr.At dinner,
Sheba, watch that I carve for him fairly.[_THE DEAN turns away and sits on the settee.SHEBA, with her head
down and her hands folded, walks towards the door, and then bounds
out._

THE DEAN.[_Turning the papers over in his hand, solemnly._] Bills![_He rises,
walks thoughtfully to a chair, sits and examines papers again._]
Bills![_He rises again, walks to another chair, and sinks into it
with a groan._] Bills!_SALOME and SHEBA re-enter._

SALOME.[_To SHEBA, in a whisper._] Papa's alone!A beautiful opportunity to ask for that little present of money.[_They link their hands together and walk as if going out through the
Library._

THE DEAN.[_Looking up._] Don't go, children![_He rises, the girls rush to him, and laughing with joy they turn him
like a top, dancing round him._

[_Panting._] Stop, children![_Pinching his chin._] He always is!Papsey will listen to our little wants!SALOME sits on the ground embracing his
legs, SHEBA lies on the top of the table._

THE DEAN._L--s--d,_ Papsey, or _L--s,_ Papsey, and never mind the--_d._

THE DEAN.I am glad, really glad, children, that you have broken through
a reserve which has existed on this point for at least a
fortnight--and babbled for money.[_Laughing with delight._] Ha!It gives me the opportunity of meeting your demands with candor.Children, I have love for you, solicitude for you, but--I have no
spare cash for anybody.[_He rises and walks gloomily across to the piano, on the top of which
he commences to arrange his bills.In horror SALOME scrambles up from
the floor, and SHEBA wriggles off the table.Simultaneously they drop
on to the same chair and huddle together._

SALOME.And now you have so cheerily opened the subject, let me tell you with
equal good humor [_emphatically flourishing the bills_] that this sort
of thing must be put a stop to.Your dressmaker's bill is shocking;
your milliner gives an analytical record of the feverish beatings of
the hot pulse of fashion; your general draper blows a rancorous blast
which would bring dismay to the stoutest heart.Let me for once peal
out a deep paternal bass to your childish treble and say
emphatically--I've had enough of it!The two girls utter a loud yell of grief._

SHEBA.[_Through her tears._] We've been brought up as young ladies--that
can't be done for nothing!Sheba's small, but she cuts into a lot of material.My girls, it is such unbosomings as this which preserve the domestic
unison of a family.The total of these weeds
which spring up in the beautiful garden of paternity is a hundred and
fifty-six, eighteen, three.Now, all the money I can immediately
command is considerably under five hundred pounds.But read, Salome, read aloud this paragraph in "The Times" of
yesterday.[_He hands a copy of "The Times" to SALOME with his finger upon a
paragraph._

SALOME.[_Reading._] "A Munificent Offer.Marvells,
whose anxiety for the preservation of the Minister Spire threatens to
undermine his health, has subscribed the munificent sum of one
thousand pounds to the Restoration Fund."[_Reading._] "On condition that seven other donors come forward, each
with the like sum."[_Anxiously._] My darling, times are bad, but one never knows.Then you will have your new summer dresses as usual.[_Hoarsely._] But if they do![_Gloomily._] Then we will all rejoice![_The two girls cling to each other as BLORE comes from the Library
with two letters on a salver._

BLORE.The second post, sir--just hin.[_Hearing SALOME and SHEBA crying._] They've 'ad a scolding, 'ussies.Let 'em 'ang that on the 'atstand![_He is going out._

THE DEAN.[_Opening letters._] Oh, Blore!Hodder, the
Secretary of "The Sport and Relaxation Repression Guild," reminds me
that to-morrow is the first day of the Races--the St.Marvells Spring
Meeting, as it is called.Hindeed, sir--fancy that!All our servants may not resemble you, Blore.Pray remind them in the
kitchen and the stable of the rule of the house----

BLORE.No servant allowed to leave the Deanery, on hany pretence, while the
Races is on.[_Kindly._] While the races _are_ on--thank you, Blore.[_Opens his second letter._

BLORE.[_To himself._] Oh, if the Dean only knew the good
thing I could put him on to for the Durnstone Handicap![_He goes out._

THE DEAN.My dear widowed sister, Georgiana Tidman.Georgiana and I reconciled after all these years!She
will help us to keep the expenses down.[_Embracing his daughters._] A second mother to my girls.She will
implant the precepts of retrenchment if their father cannot!But, Papa, who is Aunt what's-her-name?My dears--a mournful, miserable history![_With his head bent he walks
to a chair, and holds out his hands to the girls, who go to him and
kneel at his feet._] When you were infants your Aunt Georgiana married
an individual whose existence I felt it my sad duty never to
recognize.He died ten years ago, and, therefore, we will say a misguided man.He
was a person who bred horses to run in races for amusement combined
with profit.He was also what is called a Gentleman Jockey, and it was
your aunt's wifely boast that if ever he vexed her she could take a
stone off his weight in half an hour.In due course his neck was
dislocated.You will be little wiser when I tell you he came a
cropper!Left a widow, you would think it natural that Georgiana Tidman would
have flown to her brother, himself a widower.Maddened, I
hope, by grief, she continued the career of her misguided husband, and
for years, to use her own terrible words, she was "the Daisy of the
Turf."Ill luck fell
upon her--her horses, stock, everything, came to the hammer."Come to me," I wrote, "my children yearn for you."Marvells, with the cares of a household, and a
stable which contains only a thirteen-year-old pony, you may obtain
rest and forgetfulness."[_Stamping with vexation._] Ugh!Salome, Sheba, you will, I fear, find her a sad broken creature, a
weary fragment, a wave-tossed derelict.Let it be your patient
endeavor to win back a flickering smile to the wan features of this
chastened widow._BLORE enters with a telegram._

BLORE.[_THE DEAN opens telegram._

SHEBA.Mary travelled to the bedroom.No Aunt Tidman flickers a smile at me!I wouldn't be in her shoes for something!Yes, and the peg out of the rattling window![_They grip hands earnestly._

THE DEAN.Girls, your Aunt Georgiana slept at the
"Wheatsheaf," at Durnstone, last night, and is coming on this morning!Blore, tell Willis to get the chaise out.[_BLORE hurries out._

THE DEAN.Salome, child, you and I will drive into Durnstone--we may be in time
to bring your Aunt over.[_The clang of the gate
bell is heard in the distance._] The bell![_Looking out of window._]
No--yes--it can't be![_Speaking in an altered voice._] Children!I
wonder if this is your Aunt Georgiana?Daniel went to the bedroom.[_BLORE appears with a half-frightened, surprised look._

BLORE._GEORGIANA TIDMAN enters.She is a jovial, noisy woman, very "horsey"
in manners and appearance, and dressed in pronounced masculine style,
with billy cock hat and coaching coat.The girls cling to each other;
THE DEAN recoils._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, my boy, how are you?[_Patting THE DEAN'S cheeks._] You're putting on too much flesh,
Augustin; they should give you a ten-miler daily in a blanket.[_To SALOME._] Kiss your Aunt![_She
kisses SALOME with a good hearty smack._] [_To SHEBA._] Kiss your
Aunt![_She embraces SHEBA, then stands between the two girls and
surveys them critically, touching them alternately with the end of her
cane._] Lord bless you both![_Looking at SHEBA._] Why, little 'un, your stable companion could
give you a stone and then get her nose in front![_Who has been impatiently fuming._] Georgiana, I fear these poor
innocents don't follow your well-intentioned but inappropriate
illustrations.Oh, we'll soon wake 'em up.Well, Augustin, my boy, it's nearly twenty
years since you and I munched our corn together.Since then we've both run many races, though we've never met in the
same events.The world has ridden us both pretty hard at times, Gus,
hasn't it?We've been punished and pulled and led down pretty often,
but here we are [_tapping him sharply in the chest with her cane_]
sound in the wind yet.You're doing well, Gus, and they say you're
going up the hill neck-and-neck with your Bishop.I've dropped out of
it--the mares don't last, Gus--and it's good and kind of you to give
me a dry stable and a clean litter, and to keep me out of the shafts
of a "Shrewsbury and Talbot."[_In a whisper to SALOME._] Salome, I don't quite understand her--but
I like Aunt.So do I. But she's not my idea of a weary fragment or a chastened
widow.My dear Georgiana, I rejoice that you meet me in this affectionate
spirit, and when--pardon me--when you have a little caught the _tone_
of the Deanery----

GEORGIANA.Oh, I'll catch it; if I don't the Deanery will a little catch _my_
tone--the same thing.[_SHEBA laughs._

THE DEAN.[_Reprovingly._] Toy-child!Trust George Tidd for setting things quite square in a palace or a
puddle.I am George Tidd--that was my racing name.Ask after George Tidd at
Newmarket--they'll tell you all about me.[_Producing her pocket-handkerchief, which is crimson and black._

THE DEAN.[_The girls go into the Library._

THE DEAN.[_Tapping the handkerchief._] I understand distinctly from your letter
that all this is finally abandoned?They'll never see my colors at the post again!And the contemplation of sport generally as a mental distraction----?Oh, yes--I dare say you'll manage to wean me from that, too, in time.[_The gate bell is heard again, the girls re-enter._

GEORGIANA.I'll tootle upstairs and have a groom down.[_To
SALOME and SHEBA._] Make the running, girls.At what time do we feed,
Augustin?There is luncheon at one o'clock.The air here is so fresh I sha'n't be sorry to get my nose-bag
on.[_She stalks out, accompanied by the girls._

THE DEAN.My sister, Georgiana--my widowed sister, Georgiana.Surely, surely the serene atmosphere of the Deanery
will work a change.If not, what a grave mistake I
have made.No, no, I won't think of it!Still, it is a
little unfortunate that poor Georgiana should arrive here on the very
eve of these terrible races at St._BLORE enters with a card._

THE DEAN.[_Reading the card._] "Sir Tristram Mardon."[_BLORE goes out._] Mardon--why,
Mardon and I haven't met since Oxford.[_BLORE re-enters, showing in SIR TRISTRAM MARDON, a well-preserved
man of about fifty, with a ruddy face and jovial manner, the type of
the thorough English sporting gentleman.BLORE goes out._

SIR TRISTRAM.Hullo, Jedd, how are you?My dear Mardon--are we boys again?[_Boisterously._] Of course we are![_He hits THE DEAN violently in the chest._

THE DEAN.[_Breathing heavily--to himself._] I quite forgot how rough Mardon
used to be.I'm still a bachelor--got terribly jilted by a woman years ago and
have run in blinkers ever since.[_With dignity._] I have been a widower for fifteen years.awfully sorry--can't be helped though, can it?Daniel moved to the kitchen.[_Seizing THE
DEAN'S hand and squeezing it._] Forgive me, old chap.[_Withdrawing his hand with pain._] O-o-oh!I've re-opened an old wound--damned stupid of me!What do you think I'm down here for?For the benefit of your health, Mardon?Never had an ache in my life; sha'n't come and hear you preach
next Sunday, Gus.Hush, my dear Mardon, my girls----

SIR TRISTRAM.May I trot 'em into the paddock to-morrow?You've seen the list of Starters for the Durnstone
Handicap----?Sir Tristram Mardon's Dandy Dick, nine stone two, Tom
Gallawood up![_Digging THE DEAN in the ribs._] Look out for my colors--black and
white, and a pink cap--first past the post to-morrow.Really, my dear Mardon----

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, they talk about Bonny Betsy.The tongue of scandal----

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Taking THE DEAN'S arm and walking him about._] Do you imagine, sir,
for one moment, that Bonny Betsy, with a boy on her back, can get down
that bill with those legs of hers?George Tidd knew what she was about when she stuck to
Dandy Dick to the very last.[_Aghast._] George--Tidd?Dandy came out of her stable after she smashed.My dear Mardon, I am of course heartily pleased to revive in this way
our old acquaintance.I wish it were in my power to offer you the
hospitality of the Deanery--but----

SIR TRISTRAM.My horse and I are over the way at "The Swan."Marvells----

SIR TRISTRAM.You mean that the colors you ride
in don't show up well on the hill yonder or in the stable of the
"Swan" Inn.You must remember----

SIR TRISTRAM.I remember that in your young days you made the heaviest book on the
Derby of any of our fellows.I always lost, Mardon; indeed, I always lost!I remember that you once matched a mare of your own against another of
Lord Beckslade's for fifty pounds!Yes, but she wasn't in it, Mardon--I mean she was dreadfully beaten.[_Shaking his head sorrowfully._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--other times, other
manners.You're not--you're not offended, Mardon?[_Taking THE DEAN'S hand._] Offended!No--only sorry, Dean, damned
sorry, to see a promising lad come to an end like this.[_GEORGIANA
enters with SALOME on one side of her and SHEBA on the other--all
three laughing and chatting, apparently the best of friends._] By
Jove![_They shake hands warmly._

SIR TRISTRAM.Of all places in the world, to find "Mr.[_Roaring with
laughter._] Ho!Why, Dean, you've been chaffing me, have you?Yes, you have--you've been roasting your old friend!Tidd is a pal of yours, eh?Yes, I've been running a bit dark, Mardon, but that stout,
well-seasoned animal over there and this skittish creature come of the
same stock and were foaled in the same stable.[_Pointing to SALOME
and SHEBA._] There are a couple of yearlings here, you don't know.My
nieces--Salome and Sheba.[_Bowing._] How do you do?[_Heartily taking GEORGIANA'S hand again._]
Well, I don't care whose sister you are, but I'm jolly glad to see
you, George, my boy.Gracious, Tris, don't squeeze my hand so![_In horror._] Salome, Sheba, children![_To himself._] Oh, what shall I do with my widowed
sister?[_He goes into the garden._

SHEBA.[_To SALOME._] That's like pa, just as we were getting interested.[_They go out by the window._

SIR TRISTRAM.You know your brother and I were at Oxford together,
George?Well, then, you just lay a thousand sovereigns to a gooseberry
that in this house I'm a Dean, too!I suppose he's thinking of the Canons--and the Bishop--and those
chaps.Lord bless your heart, they're all right when you cheer them up a bit!If I'm here till the autumn meeting you'll find me lunching on the
hill, with the Canons marking my card and the dear old Bishop mixing
the salad.So say the word, Tris--I'll make it all right with
Augustin.The fact is I'm fixed at the "Swan" with--what
do you think, George?--with Dandy Dick.I brought him down with me in lavender.You know he runs for the
Durnstone Handicap to-morrow.There's precious little that horse does that I don't know, and
what I don't know I dream.As a fiddle--shines like a mirror--not an ounce too much or too
little.[_Mysteriously._] Tris, Dandy Dick doesn't belong to you--not _all_ of
him.At your sale he was knocked down to John
Fielder the trainer.No, it doesn't, it belongs to _me!_

SIR TRISTRAM.Yes, directly I saw Dandy Dick marched out before the auctioneer I
asked John Fielder to help me, and he did, like a Briton.For I can't
live without horseflesh, if it's only a piece of cat's meat on a
skewer.But when I condescended to keep company with the Canons and
the Bishop here I promised Augustin that I wouldn't own anything on
four legs, so John sold you half of Dick, and I can swear I don't own
a horse--and I don't--not a whole one.But half a horse is better than
no bread, Tris--and we're partners._SALOME and SHEBA enter unperceived._

SIR TRISTRAM.ho!--I beg your pardon, George--ha!Well, now you know he's fit, of course, you're going to back Dandy
Dick for the Durnstone Handicap.For every penny I've got in the world.That isn't much, but
if I'm not a richer woman by a thousand pounds to-morrow night I shall
have had a bad day.[_The girls come towards the Library._

GEORGIANA.[_The girls go into the Library._

SIR TRISTRAM.Keep your eye on the old horse, Tristram.[_SIR TRISTRAM bursts out laughing again, she
joining in the laughter._] Oh, do be quiet!Oh, say good-bye for me to the Dean![_She gives
him a push and he goes out._

_SHEBA and SALOME immediately re-enter from the Library._

SHEBA.Aunt--dear Aunt----

GEORGIANA.Aunt--Salome has something to say to you.[_Catching hold of SHEBA._] Hallo,
little 'un!Aunt--dear Aunt Georgiana--we heard you say something about a thousand
pounds.And, oh, Aunt, a thousand pounds is such a
lot, and we poor girls want such a little.I haven't, any more than you have, Sheba.Well, I'm in debt too, but I only meant to beg for Salome; but now I
ask for both of us.Oh, Aunt Tidman, papa has told us that you have
known troubles.Because Salome and I are weary fragments too--we're
everything awful but chastened widows.Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, you girls!To cry and go on like this about forty pounds!But we've only got fifteen and threepence of our own in the world!And, oh, Aunt, you know something about the Races, don't you?If you do, help two poor creatures to win forty pounds, nineteen.Aunt
Georgiana, what's "Dandy Dick" you were talking to that gentleman
about?Then let Dandy Dick win _us_ some money.Do, and we'll love you for ever and ever, Aunt Georgiana.[_She embraces them heartily._] Bless your little innocent
faces!Do you want to win _fifty_ pounds?[_Taking her betting book from her pocket._] Very well, then, put your
very petticoats on Dandy Dick![_The girls stand clutching their skirts, frightened._

SALOME.The morning-room at the Deanery, with the fire and the lamps lighted.SHEBA is playing the piano, SALOME lolling upon the settee, and
GEORGIANA pouring out tea.I call you Sally, Salome--the evening's too short for
your name.All right, Aunt George--two lumps, please.[_To SHEBA._] Little 'un?Two lumps and one in the saucer, to eat.Quite a relief to shake off the gentlemen, isn't it?Oh, _I_ don't think so.Now I understand why my foot was always in the way under the
dinner-table.[_She holds out two cups, which the girls take from her._

SALOME.Well, it was Cook's first attempt at custards.Now we _know_ the chimney wants
sweeping.But it was a frightfully jolly dinner--take it all round.What made us all so sad and silent--taking us all round?Dear Papa was as lively as an owl with neuralgia.Major Tarver isn't a conversational cracker.Gerald Tarver has no liver--to speak of.He might have spoken about his lungs or something, to cheer us up.Darbey was about to make a witty remark once.Yes, and then the servant handed him a dish and he shied at it.Still, we ought to congratulate ourselves upon--upon a----

SHEBA.Upon a--upon a----

GEORGIANA.[_Taking her betting book from her
pocket._] Excuse me, girls.If Dandy
Dick hasn't fed better at the "Swan" than we have at the Deanery, he
won't be in the first three.[_Reckoning._] Let me see.[_To SHEBA._] All's settled, Sheba, isn't it?[_To SALOME._] Yes--everything.Directly the house is silent we let
ourselves out at the front door.It has a patent safety fastening, so it can be opened
with a hairpin.Yes, I don't consider we're ordinary young ladies, at all.If we had known Aunt a little longer we might have confided in her and
taken her with us.Poor Aunt--we mustn't spoil her.[_Speaking outside._] I venture to differ with you, my dear Dean.[_She joins the girls as DARBEY enters through the Library,
patronizing THE DEAN, who accompanies him._

DARBEY.I've just been putting the Dean right about a little army
question, Mrs.--Mrs.---- I can't catch your name.Don't try--you'd come out in spots, like measles.[DARBEY _stands by her, blankly, then attempts a conversation._

THE DEAN.[_To SALOME and SHEBA._] Children, it is useless to battle against it
much longer.Oh, Papsey--think what Wellington was at his age._MAJOR TARVER enters, pale and haggard._

_SALOME meets him._

SALOME.But what would you do if the trumpet summoned you to battle?Oh, I suppose I should pack up a few charcoal biscuits and toddle out,
you know.[_To DARBEY._] I've never studied the Army Guide.You're thinking of----

GEORGIANA.I mean, the Army keeps a string of trained
nurses, doesn't it?I was wondering whether your Colonel will send one with a
perambulator to fetch you at about half-past eight.[_She leaves DARBEY and goes to THE DEAN.SHEBA joins DARBEY at the
piano._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, my boy, you seem out of condition.I'm rather anxious for the post to bring to-day's "Times."You know
I've offered a thousand pounds to our Restoration Fund.BLORE enters to remove the tea-tray._

TARVER.[_Jumping up excitedly--to SALOME._] Eh?[_Singing to himself._] "Come into the garden, Maud, for the black
bat----"

SALOME.I'm always dreadfully excited when I'm asked to sing.It's as good as
a carbonate of soda lozenge to me to be asked to sing.[_To BLORE._]
My music is in my overcoat pocket.[_BLORE crosses to the door._

SHEBA.[_In a rage, glaring at DARBEY._] Hah![_To BLORE._] You'll find it in the hall.SALOME and SHEBA talk to
GEORGIANA at the table._

TARVER.[_To himself._] He always presumes with his confounded fiddle when I'm
going to entertain.He knows that his fiddle's never hoarse and that I
am, sometimes.[_To himself._] Tarver always tries to cut me out with his elderly
Chest C. He ought to put it on the Retired List.I'll sing him off his legs to-night--I'm in lovely voice.[_He walks into the Library and is heard trying his voice, singing
"Come into the garden, Maud.[_To himself._] He needn't bother himself.While he was dozing in the
carriage I threw his music out of the window._TARVER re-enters triumphantly._

_BLORE re-enters, carrying a violin-case and a leather music roll.DARBEY takes the violin-case, opens it, and produces his violin and
music.BLORE hands the music roll to TARVER and goes out._

TARVER.[_To SALOME, trembling with excitement._] My tones are like a
beautiful bell this evening.I'm so glad, for all our sakes.[_As he
takes the leather music roll from BLORE._] Thank you, that's it.I've begun with "Corne into the garden,
Maud" for years and years.Daniel went to the hallway.[_He opens the music roll--it is empty._]
Oh!Miss Jedd, I've forgotten my music![_TARVER with a groan of despair sinks on to the settee._

SHEBA.[_Tuning his violin._] Will you accompany me?[_Raising her eyes._] To the end of the world.[_She sits at the piano._

DARBEY.My mother says that my bowing is something like Joachim's, and she
ought to know.Oh, because she's heard Joachim.[_DARBEY plays and SHEBA accompanies him.SALOME sits beside TARVER._

GEORGIANA.[_To herself._] Well, after all, George, my boy, you're not stabled in
such a bad box!Here is a regular pure, simple, English Evening at
Home![_Mumbling to himself._] A thousand pounds to the Restoration Fund and
all those bills to settle--oh dear![_To herself._] I hope my ball-dress will drive all the other women
mad![_To himself--glaring at DARBEY._] I feel I should like to garrote him
with his bass string.[_Frowning at her betting book._] I think I shall hedge a bit over the
Crumbleigh Stakes.[_As he plays, glancing at TARVER._] I wonder how old Tarver's Chest C
likes a holiday.[_As she plays._] We must get Pa to bed early.Dear Papa's always so
dreadfully in the way.[_Looking around._] No--there's nothing like it in any other country.A regular, pure, simple, English Evening at Home!_BLORE enters quickly, cutting "The Times" with a paper-knife as he
enters._

BLORE.[_The music stops abruptly--all the ladies glare at BLORE and hush him
down._

GEORGIANA, SALOME, _and_ SHEBA.[_Taking the paper from BLORE._] This is my fault--there may be
something in "The Times" of special interest to me.[_BLORE goes out._

TARVER.[_Scanning the paper._] Oh, I can't believe it!TARVER _and_ DARBEY.My munificent offer has produced the
desired result.Seven wealthy people, including three brewers, have come forward with
a thousand pounds apiece in aid of the restoration of the Minster
Spire!That means a cool thousand out of your pocket, Gus.[_Reading._] "The anxiety to which The Dean of St.Marvells has
so long been a victim will now doubtless be relieved."[_With his hand
to his head._] I suppose I shall feel the relief to-morrow.It _is_ a little out of repair--but hardly sufficiently so to warrant
the presumptuous interference of three brewers.Excuse me, I think
I'll enjoy the fresh air for a moment.[_He goes to the window and
draws back the curtains--a bright red glare is seen in the sky._]
Bless me!GEORGIANA, SALOME, _and_ SHEBA.[_Clinging to TARVER._] Where is it?[_Clinging to DARBEY._] Where is it?_BLORE enters with a scared look._

THE DEAN.[_To BLORE._] Where is it?[_The gate-bell is heard ringing violently in the distance.BLORE goes
out._

GEORGIANA.[_Uttering a loud screech._] The Swan Inn![_Madly._] You girls, get
me a hat and coat.[_SALOME, SHEBA, and TARVER go to the window._

THE DEAN.[_To TARVER._] Lend me your boots!If I once get cold extremities----

GEORGIANA.[_She is going, THE DEAN stops her._

THE DEAN.Respect yourself, Georgiana--where are you going?I'm going to help clear the stables at The Swan!Remember what you are--my sister--a lady!George Tidd's a man, every inch of her![_SIR TRISTRAM rushes
in breathlessly.GEORGIANA rushes at him and clutches his coat._] Tris
Mardon, speak!That old horse has backed himself to win the handicap.TARVER and DARBEY with SALOME and SHEBA
stand looking out of the window._

SIR TRISTRAM.George, his tail is singed a bit.The less weight for him to carry to-morrow.[_Beginning to cry._] Dear
old Dandy, he never was much to look at.The worst of it is, the fools threw two pails of cold water over him
to put it out.[_THE DEAN goes distractedly into the
Library._] Where is the animal?My man Hatcham is running him up and down the lane here to try to get
him warm again.Where are you going to put the homeless beast up now?Georgiana, pray consider _me!_

GEORGIANA.So I will, when you've had two pails of water thrown over you.[_THE DEAN walks about in despair._

THE DEAN.Mardon, I appeal to _you!_

SIR TRISTRAM.Oh, Dean, Dean, I'm ashamed of you![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Are you ready?[_Takes off his coat and throws it over GEORGIANA'S shoulders._]
George, you're a brick![_Quietly to him._] One partner pulls Dandy out of the
Swan--t'other one leads Dandy into the Deanery.[_They go out together._

THE DEAN."Sir
Tristram Mardon's Dandy Dick reflected great credit upon the Deanery
Stables!"[_He walks into the Library, where he sinks into a chair, as SALOME,
TARVER, DARBEY and SHEBA come from the window._

TARVER.If I had had my goloshes with me I
should have been here, there, and everywhere.Where there's a crowd of Civilians the Military exercise a wise
discretion in restraining themselves.[_To TARVER and DARBEY._] You had better go now; then we'll get the
house quiet as soon as possible.We will wait with the carriage in the lane.[_Calling._] Papa, Major Tarver and Mr.THE DEAN comes from the Library._

THE DEAN.[_Shaking hands._] Most fascinating evening![_Shaking hands._] Charming, my dear Dean._BLORE enters._

SALOME.[_BLORE goes out, followed by SHEBA, SALOME, and TARVER.DARBEY is
going, when he returns to THE DEAN._

DARBEY.By-the-bye, my dear Dean--come over and see me.We ought to know more
of each other.[_Restraining his anger._] I will _not_ say Monday!Oh--and I say--let me know when you preach, and
I'll get some of our fellows to give their patronage![_He goes out._

THE DEAN.[_Closing the door after him with a bang._] Another moment--another
moment--and I fear I should have been violently rude to him, a guest
under my roof![_He walks up to the fireplace and stands looking into
the fire, as DARBEY.having forgotten his violin, returns to the
room._] Oh, Blore, now understand me, if that Mr.Darbey ever again
presumes to present himself at the Deanery I will not see him![_With his violin in his hand, haughtily._] I've come back for my
violin.[_Goes out with dignity._

THE DEAN.GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM enter by the
window._

GEORGIANA.Don't be down, Tris, my boy; cheer up, lad, he'll be fit yet, bar a
chill!he knew me, he knew me when I kissed his dear old nose!He'd be a fool of a horse if he hadn't felt deuced flattered at that.He knows he's in the Deanery too.Did you see him cast
up his eyes and lay his ears back when I led him in?Oh, George, George, it's such a pity about his tail!You watch his head to-morrow--that'll come in
first.[_HATCHAM, a groom, looks in at the window._

HATCHAM.I jest run round to tell you that Dandy is a feedin' as steady as a
baby with a bottle.And I've got hold of the constable 'ere, Mr.Topping--he's going to sit up with me, for company's sake.[_Coming forward mysteriously._] Why, bless you and
the lady, sir--supposin' the fire at the "Swan" warn't no accident!Supposin' it were inciderism--and supposin' our 'orse was the hobject.That's why I ain't goin' to watch single-handed.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA pace up and down excitedly._

HATCHAM.There's only one mortal fear I've got about our Dandy.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.He 'asn't found out about 'is tail yet, sir, and when he does it'll
fret him, as sure as my name's Bob Hatcham.Keep the stable pitch dark--he mayn't notice it.Not to-night, sir, but he's a proud 'orse and what'll he think of
'isself on the 'ill to-morrow?You and me and the lady, sir--it 'ud be
different with us, but how's our Dandy to hide his bereavement?[_HATCHAM goes out of the window with SIR TRISTRAM as THE DEAN enters,
followed by BLORE, who carries a lighted lantern._

THE DEAN.[_Looking reproachfully at GEORGIANA._] You have returned, Georgiana?You can sleep to-night with the happy consciousness of having
sheltered the outcast.The poor children, exhausted with the alarm, beg
me to say good-night for them.Yes, sir; but I hear they've just sent into Durnstone hasking for the
Military to watch the ruins in case of another houtbreak.It'll stop
the wicked Ball at the Hathanaeum, it will![_Drawing the window curtains._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Having re-entered._] I suppose you want to see the last of me, Jedd.Where shall we stow the dear old chap, Gus, my
boy?Where shall we stow the dear old chap!We don't want to pitch you out of your loft if we can help
it, Gus.No, no--we won't do that.But there's Sheba's little cot still
standing in the old nursery.Just the thing for me--the old nursery.Toys to play with if you wake early.[_Looking round._] Is there anyone else before we lock up?[_BLORE has fastened the window and drawn the curtain._

GEORGIANA.Put Sir Tristram to bed carefully in the nursery, Blore.[_Grasping THE DEAN'S hand._] Good-night, old boy.I'm too done for a
hand of Piquet to-night.[_Slapping him on the back._] I'll teach you during my stay at the
Deanery.[_Helplessly to himself._] Then he's staying with me!Heaven bless the little innocent in his cot.[_SIR TRISTRAM goes out with BLORE._

GEORGIANA.We
smoke all over the Deanery.Does _she?_

GEORGIANA.[_Closes the door, humming a tune merrily._] Tra la, tra la![_She stops, looking at THE DEAN,
who is muttering to himself._] Gus, I don't like your looks, I shall
let the Vet see you in the morning.[_THE DEAN shakes his head mournfully, and sinks on the settee._

GEORGIANA.There _are_ bills, which, at a more convenient time, it will be my
grateful duty to discharge.Stumped--out of coin--run low.Very little would settle the bills--but--but----

GEORGIANA.Why, Gus, you haven't got that thousand.There is a very large number of estimable worthy men who do not
possess a thousand pounds.With that number I have the mournful
pleasure of enrolling myself.Unless the restoration is immediately commenced the spire will
certainly crumble.Then it's a match between you and the spire which parts first.Gus,
will you let your little sister lend you a hand?No, no--not out of my own pocket.[_She takes his arm and
whispers in his ear._] Can you squeeze a pair of ponies?Very well then--clap it on to Dandy Dick!He's a certainty--if those two buckets of water haven't put him off
it!He's a moral--if he doesn't think of his tail coming down the
hill.Keep it dark, Gus--don't
breathe a word to any of your Canons or Archdeacons, or they'll rush
at it and shorten the price for us.Go in, Gus, my boy--take your poor
widowed sister's tip and sleep as peacefully as a blessed baby![_She presses him warmly to her and kisses him._

THE DEAN.In the morning I will endeavor to frame some verbal expression of the
horror with which I regard your proposal.For the present, you are my
parents' child and I trust your bed is well aired.I've done all I can for the Spire._Bon
soir,_ old boy!If you're wiser in the morning just send Blore on to the course and
he'll put the money on for you.My poor devoted old servant would be lost on a race-course.He was quite at home in Tattersall's Ring when I was at St.I recognized the veteran sportsman the moment I came into the
Deanery._BLORE enters with his lantern._

GEORGIANA.Investing the savings of your cook and housemaid, of course.You don't
think your servants are as narrow as you are!Sandra went back to the bathroom.I beg your pardon, sir, shall I go the rounds, sir?[_THE DEAN gives Blore a fierce look, but BLORE beams sweetly._

GEORGIANA.And pack a hamper with a cold chicken, some
French rolls, and two bottles of Heidsieck--label it "George Tidd,"
and send it on to the Hill.THE DEAN sinks into a chair and clasps his forehead._

BLORE.A dear, 'igh-sperited lady.[_Leaning over THE DEAN._] Aren't you
well, sir?Meanin' _me,_ sir?THE DEAN

Lock up; I'll speak to you in the morning.[_BLORE goes into the Library, turns out the lamp there, and
disappears._

What dreadful wave threatens to engulf the Deanery?What has come to
us in a few fatal hours?A horse of sporting tendencies contaminating
my stables, his equally vicious owner nestling in the nursery, and my
own widowed sister, in all probability, smoking a cigarette at her
bedroom window with her feet on the window-ledge![_Listening._]
What's that?[_He peers through the window curtains._] I thought I
heard footsteps in the garden.I can see nothing--only the old spire
standing out against the threatening sky.[_Leaving the window
shudderingly._] The Spire!My principal
creditor, the most conspicuous object in the city!_BLORE re-enters with his lantern, carrying some bank-notes in his
hand._

BLORE.[_Laying the notes on the table._] I found these, sir, on your
dressing-table--they're bank-notes, sir.I placed them there to be sent to the
Bank to-morrow.[_Counting the notes._] Ten--ten--twenty--five--five,
fifty.The very sum Georgiana urged me to--oh![_To
BLORE, waving him away._] Leave me--go to bed--go to bed--go to bed![_BLORE is going._] Blore!What made you tempt me with these at such a moment?The window was hopen, and I feared they might blow
away.[_Catching him by the coat collar._] Man, what were you doing at St.[_With a cry, falling on his knees._] Oh, sir!I knew that
'igh-sperited lady would bring grief and sorrow to the peaceful, 'appy
Deanery!Oh, sir, I _'ave_ done a little on my hown account from time
to time on the 'ill, halso hon commission for the kitchen!Oh, sir, you are a old gentleman--turn a charitable 'art to the Races!It's a wicious institution what spends more ready money in St.Marvells than us good people do in a year.Oh, Edward Blore, Edward Blore, what weak
creatures we are!We are, sir--we are--'specially when we've got a tip, sir.Think of
the temptation of a tip, sir.Bonny Betsy's bound for to win the
'andicap.I know better; she can never get down the hill with those legs of
hers.She can, sir--what's to beat her?The horse in my stable--Dandy Dick!That old bit of ma'ogany, sir.They're layin' ten to one
against him.[_With hysterical eagerness._] Are they?Lord love you, sir--fur how much?[_Impulsively he crams the notes into
BLORE'S hand and then recoils in horror._] Oh![_Sinks into a chair with a groan._

BLORE.[_In a whisper._] Lor', who'd 'ave thought the Dean was such a ardent
sportsman at 'art?He dursn't give me my notice after this.[_To THE
DEAN._] Of course it's understood, sir, that we keep our little
weaknesses dark.Houtwardly, sir, we remain respectable, and, I 'ope,
respected.[_Putting the notes into his pocket._] I wish you
good-night, sir.THE DEAN makes an effort to
recall him but fails._] And that old man 'as been my pattern and
example for years and years!Oh, Edward Blore, your hidol is
shattered![_Turning to THE DEAN._] Good-night, sir.May your dreams
be calm and 'appy, and may you have a good run for your money![_BLORE goes out--THE DEAN gradually recovers his self-possession._

THE DEAN.I--I am upset to-night, Blore.I--I [_looking round._] Blore!If I don't call him back the
Spire may be richer to-morrow by five hundred pounds.[_Snatches a book at haphazard from the
bookshelf.There is the sound of falling rain and distant thunder._]
Rain, thunder.How it assimilates with the tempest of my mind![_Reading._] "The Horse and its
Ailments, by John Cox, M. R. C. V.It was with the aid of this
volume that I used to doctor my old mare at Oxford.[_Reading._] "Simple remedies for chills--the Bolus."The
helpless beast in my stable is suffering from a chill.If I allow Blore to risk my fifty pounds on Dandy Dick, surely it
would be advisable to administer this Bolus to the poor animal without
delay.[_Referring to the book hastily._] I have these drugs in my
chest.[_Going to the bell and
ringing._] I shall want help.[_He lays the book upon the table and goes into the Library._

_BLORE enters._

BLORE.The Dean's puzzling me
with his uncommon behavior, that he is.[_THE DEAN comes from the Library, carrying a large medicine chest.On
encountering BLORE he starts and turns away his head, the picture of
guilt._

THE DEAN.Blore, I feel it would be a humane act to administer to the poor
ignorant animal in my stable a simple Bolus as a precaution against
chill.I rely upon your aid and discretion in ministering to any guest
in the Deanery.[_In a whisper._] I see, sir--you ain't going to lose half a chance
for to-morrow, sir--you're a knowin' one, sir, as the sayin' goes![_Shrinking from BLORE with a groan._] Oh![_He places the medicine
chest on the table and takes up the book.Handing the book to BLORE
with his finger on a page._] Fetch these humble but necessary articles
from the kitchen--quick.[_BLORE goes out
quickly._] It is exactly seven and twenty years since I last
approached a horse medically.[_He takes off his coat and lays it on a
chair, then rolls his shirt-sleeves up above his elbows and puts on
his glasses._] I trust that this Bolus will not give the animal an
unfair advantage over his competitors.[_BLORE re-enters carrying a tray, on which are a small
flour-barrel and rolling-pin, a white china basin, a carafe of water,
a napkin, and the book.THE DEAN recoils, then guiltily takes the tray
from BLORE and puts it on the table._] Thank you.[_Holding on to the window curtain and watching THE DEAN._] His eyes
is awful; I don't seem to know the 'appy Deanery when I see such
proceedings a'goin' on at the dead of night.[_There is a heavy roll of thunder--THE DEAN mixes a pudding and stirs
it with the rolling-pin._

THE DEAN.The old half-forgotten time returns to me.I am once again a promising
youth at college.[_To himself._] One would think by his looks that he was goin' to
poison his family instead of--Poison!Oh, if hanything serious
'appened to the hanimal in our stable there would be nothing in the
way of Bonny-Betsy, the deservin' 'orse I've trusted with my
'ard-earned savings!I am walking once again in the old streets at Oxford, avoiding the
shops where I owe my youthful bills.[_He pounds away vigorously with the rolling-pin._

BLORE.[_To himself._] Where's the stuff I got a month ago to destroy the
hold black retriever that fell hill?The dog died--the poison's in my pantry--it couldn't have got used for
cooking purposes.I see the broad meadows and the tall Spire of the college--the Spire!Oh, my whole life seems made up of Bills and Spires![_To himself._] I'll do it![_Unseen by The Dean he quickly and quietly steals out by the door._

THE DEAN.[_Opening the medicine chest and
bending down over the bottles he pours some drops from a bottle into
the basin._] [_Counting._] Three--four--five--six.[_He replaces the
bottle and takes another._] How fortunate some animals are![_Counting._] One--two--three, four.[_Taking up the medicine chest he goes with it into the Library._

_As he disappears BLORE re-enters stealthily fingering a small paper
packet._

BLORE.[_In a whisper._] Strychnine![_There is a heavy roll of
thunder--BLORE darts to the table, empties the contents of the packet
into the basin, and stirs vigorously with the rolling-pin._] I've
cooked Dandy Dick![_He moves from the table
in horror._] Oh!I'm only a hamatoor sportsman and I can't afford a
uncertainty.[_As THE DEAN returns, BLORE starts up guiltily._] Can I
help you any more, Sir?No, remove these dreadful things, and don't let me see you again
to-night![_Sits with the basin on his knees, and proceeds to roll the paste._

BLORE.[_Removing the tray._] It's only an 'orse--it's only an 'orse!But
after to-morrow I'll retire from the Turf, if only to reclaim 'im.[_He goes out._

THE DEAN.[_Putting on his coat._] I don't contemplate my humane task with
resignation.The stable is small, and if the animal is restive we
shall be cramped for room.[_The rain is heard._] I shall get a chill
too.[_Seeing SIR TRISTRAM'S coat and cap lying upon the settee._] I
am sure Mardon will lend me this gladly.[_Putting on the coat, which
completely envelops him._] The animal may recognize the garment, and
receive me with kindly feeling.[_Putting on the sealskin cap, which
almost conceals his face._] Ugh!why do I feel this dreadful sinking
at the heart?[_Taking the basin and turning out the lamp._] Oh!if
all followers of the veterinary science are as truly wretched as I am,
what a noble band they must be![_The thunder rolls as he goes through the window curtains.SIR
TRISTRAM then enters quietly, smoking, and carrying a lighted candle._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Blowing out the candle._] I shall
doze here till daybreak.I never thought there was so
much thunder in these small country places.[_GEORGIANA, looking pale and agitated, and wearing a dressing-gown,
enters quickly, carrying an umbrella and a lighted candle._

GEORGIANA.I must satisfy myself--I
must--I must![_Going to the door._]

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Shrieks with fright._] Ah![_Holding out her umbrella._] Stand where you are or I'll fire![_Recognizing SIR TRISTRAM._] Tris!Oh, Tris, I've been dreaming![_Falling helplessly against Sir
Tristram, who deposits her in a chair._] Oh!I shall be on my legs again in a minute.[_She opens her umbrella and hides herself behind it, sobbing
violently._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Standing over the umbrella in great concern._] My goodness!Shall I trot you up and down outside?[_Sobbing._] What are you fooling about here for?Why can't
you lie quietly in your cot?Into the stable to sit with Dandy.The thunder's awful in my room;
when it gets tired it seems to sit down on my particular bit of roof.I did doze once, and then I had a frightful dream.I dreamt that Dandy
had sold himself to a circus, and that they were hooting him because
he had lost his tail.Don't, don't--be a man, George, be a man![_Shutting her umbrella._] I know I'm dreadfully effeminate.Ah, Tris--don't think me soft, old man.I'm a lonely, unlucky woman,
and the tail end of this horse is all that's left me in the world to
love and to cling to!I'm not such a mean cur as that!Swop halves and take his
head, George, my boy.I'm like a doating mother to my share of Dandy, and it's all
the dearer because it's an invalid.[_Turning towards the window, she following him, he
suddenly stops and looks at her, and seizes her hand._] George, I
never guessed that you were so tender-hearted.And you've robbed me to-night of an old friend--a pal.I mean that I seem to have dropped the acquaintance of George Tidd,
Esquire, forever.I have--but I've got an introduction to his twin-sister, Georgiana![_Snatching her hand away angrily._] Stay where you are; I'll nurse my
half alone.[_She goes towards the window, then starts back._] Hush![_Pointing to the window._] There.[_Peeping through the curtains._] You're right.[_SIR TRISTRAM takes the candlestick and they go out leaving the room
in darkness.The curtains at the window are pushed aside, and SALOME
and SHEBA enter; both in their fancy dresses._

SALOME.[_In a rage, lighting the candles on the mantelpiece._] Oh!If we only had a brother to avenge us!I shall try and borrow a brother to-morrow!Cold, wretched, splashed, in debt--for nothing!To think that we've had all the inconvenience of being wicked and
rebellious and have only half done it!It serves us right--we've been trained for clergymen's wives.Gerald Tarver's nose is inclined to pink--may it deepen and deepen
till it frightens cows![_Voices are heard from the curtained window recess._

DARBEY.[_Outside._] Miss Jedd--Sheba![_Outside._] Pray hear two wretched men![_In a whisper._] There they are.Shall we grant them a dignified interview?You curl your lip better than I--I'll dilate my nostrils.They are
both very badly and shabbily dressed as Cavaliers._

TARVER.[_A most miserable object, carrying a carriage umbrella._] Oh, don't
reproach us, Miss Jedd.It isn't our fault that the Military were
summoned to St.You don't blame officers and gentlemen for responding to the sacred
call of duty?We blame officers for subjecting two motherless girls to the shock of
alighting at the Durnstone Athenaeum to find a notice on the front
door: "Ball knocked on the head--Vivat Regina."We blame gentlemen for inflicting upon us the unspeakable agony of
being jeered at by boys.I took the address of the boy who suggested that we should call again
on the fifth of November.It is on the back of your admission card.We shall both wait on the boy's mother for an
explanation.Oh, smile on us once again, Miss Jedd--a forced, hollow smile, if you
will--only smile._GEORGIANA enters._

GEORGIANA.[_Weeping._] No, Aunt, no![_Advancing to TARVER._] How dare you encourage these two simple
children to enjoy themselves!How dare you take them out--without
their Aunt!Do you think _I_ can't keep a thing quiet?[_Shaking TARVER._] I'm speaking to you--Field-Marshal.We shall be happy to receive your representative in the morning.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan" Inn.You mustn't distract our
attention.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan," are you?[_SIR TRISTRAM appears._] Tris, I'm a feeble woman, but I
hope I've a keen sense of right and wrong.Run these outsiders into
the road, and let them guard their own ruins.[_SALOME and SHEBA shriek, and throw themselves at the feet of TARVER
and DARBEY.clinging to their legs._

SALOME.You shall not harm a hair of their heads.[_SIR TRISTRAM twists TARVER'S wig round so that it covers his face.The gate bell is heard ringing violently._

GEORGIANA, SALOME _and_ SHEBA.[_GEORGIANA runs to the door and opens it._

SALOME.[_To TARVER and DARBEY._] Fly![_TARVER and DARBEY disappear through the curtains at the window._

SHEBA.[_Falling into SALOME'S arms._] We have saved them!Oh, Tris, your man from the stable![_HATCHAM, carrying the basin with the bolus, runs in
breathlessly--followed by BLORE._

HATCHAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.The villain that set fire to the "Swan," sir--in the hact of
administering a dose to the 'orse!Topping the constable's collared him, Sir--he's taken him in a cart to
the lock-up!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_In agony._] They've got the Dean!The first scene is the interior of a country Police Station, a quaint
old room with plaster walls, oaken beams, and a gothic mullioned
window looking on to the street.A massive door, with a small sliding
wicket and an iron grating, opens to a prisoner's cell.The room is
partly furnished as a kitchen, partly as a police station, a copy of
the Police Regulations and other official documents and implements
hanging on the wall.It is the morning after the events of the
previous act._HANNAH, a buxom, fresh-looking young woman, in a print gown, has been
engaged in cooking while singing gayly._

HANNAH.[_Opening a door and calling with a slight dialect._] Noah darling![_From another room--in a rough, country voice._] Yaas!You'll have your dinner before you drive your prisoner over to
Durnstone, won't ye, darling?[_Closing the door._] Yaas!Noah's in a nice temper to-day over
summat.Ah well, I suppose all public characters is liable to
irritation.[_There is a knock at the outer door.HANNAH opening it,
sees BLORE with a troubled look on his face._] Well I never![_Entering and shaking hands mournfully._] How do you do, Mrs.And how is the dear Dean, bless him; the sweetest soul in the world?[_To HANNAH._] I--I 'aven't seen him this morning!Well, this is real kind of you, calling on an old friend, Edward.When
I think that I were cook at the Deanery seven years, and that since I
left you, to get wedded, not a soul of you has been nigh me, it do
seem hard.Well, you see, 'Annah, the kitchen took humbrage at your marryin' a
policeman at Durnstone.Topping's got the appointment of Head Constable at St.Marvells, what's that regarded as?A rise on the scales, 'Annah, a decided rise--but still you've honly
been a week in St.Marvells and you've got to fight your way hup.I think I'm as hup as ever I'm like to be.'Owever, Jane and Sarah and Willis the stable boy 'ave hunbent so far
as to hask me to leave their cards, knowin' I was a callin'.[_He produces from an old leather pocket-book three very dirty pieces
of paste-board, which he gives to HANNAH._

HANNAH.[_Taking them in her apron with pride._] Thank 'em kindly.We receive on Toosdays, at the side gate.[_Kissing her cheek._

HANNAH.When you was Miss Hevans there wasn't these social barriers,
'Annah!Noah's jealous of the very apron-strings what go round my
waist.I'm not so free and 'andy with my kisses now, I can tell you.Topping isn't indoors
now, surely![_Nodding her head._] Um--um!Why, he took a man up last night!Why, I thought that when hany harrest was made in St.Marvells, the
prisoner was lodged here honly for the night and that the 'ead
Constable 'ad to drive 'im over to Durnstone Police Station the first
thing in the morning.That's the rule, but Noah's behindhand to-day, and ain't going into
Durnstone till after dinner.And where is the hapartment in question?The "Strong-box" they call it in St.[_Whimpering to himself._] And 'im
accustomed to his shavin' water at h'eight and my kindly hand to
button his gaiters.'Annah, 'Annah, my dear, it's this very prisoner what I 'ave called on
you respectin'.Oh, then the honor ain't a compliment to me, after all, Mr.I'm killing two birds with one stone, my dear.[_Throwing the cards into BLORE'S hat._] You can take them back to the
Deanery with Mrs.[_Shaking the cards out of his hat and replacing them in his
pocket-book._] I will leave them hon you again to-morrow, 'Annah.But,
'Annah deary, do you know that this hunfortunate man was took in our
stables last night.No, I never ask Noah nothing about Queen's business.He don't want
_two_ women over him!Then you 'aven't seen the miserable culprit?I was in bed hours when Noah brought 'im 'ome.They tell us it's only a wretched poacher or a
petty larcery we'll get in St.My poor Noah ain't never
likely to have the chance of a horrid murder in a place what returns a
Conservative.[_Kneeling to look into the oven._

BLORE.But, 'Annah, suppose this case you've got 'old of now is a case
what'll shake old England to its basis!Suppose it means columns in
the paper with Topping's name a-figurin'!Suppose as family readin',
it 'old its own with divorce cases!You know something about this arrest, you do!I merely wish to encourage
you, 'Annah; to implant an 'ope that crime may brighten your wedded
life.[_Sitting at the table and referring to an official book._] The man
was found trespassing in the Deanery Stables with intent--refuses to
give his name or any account of 'isself.[_To himself._] If I could honly find hout whether Dandy Dick had any
of the medicine it would so guide me at the Races.It
doesn't appear that the 'orse in the stables--took it, does it?[_Looking up sharply._] Took what?You're sure there's no confession of any sort, 'Annah
dear?[_As he is bending over HANNAH, NOAH TOPPING appears.NOAH is a
dense-looking ugly countryman, with red hair, a bristling heard, and a
vindictive leer.He is dressed in ill-fitting clothes, as a rural
Police Constable._

NOAH.[_Fiercely._] 'Annah![_Starting and replacing the book._] Oh don't!Blore from
the Deanery come to see us--an old friend o' mine![_BLORE advances to NOAH with a nervous smile, extending his hand._

NOAH.[_Taking BLORE'S hand and holding it firmly._] A friend of hern is a
friend o' mian!She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week, since we coom to
St.Of course, dear 'Annah was a lovin' favorite with heverybody.Well then, as her friends be mian, I'm takin' the liberty, one by
one, of gradually droppin' on 'em all.[_Getting his hand away._] Dear me!And if I catch any old fly a buzzin' round my lady I'll venture to
break his 'ead in wi' my staff![_Preparing to depart._] I--I merely called to know if hanything had
been found hout about the ruffian took in our stables last night!He's the De-an, ain't he?[_Fiercely._] Shut oop, darlin'.Topping's
respects to the Dean, and say I'll run up to the Deanery and see him
after I've took my man over to Durnstone.Thank you--I 'ope the Dean will be at 'ome.[_Offering his hand, into which NOAH significantly places his
truncheon.BLORE goes out quickly._

HANNAH.[_Whimpering._] Oh, Noah, Noah, I don't believe as we shall ever get a
large circle of friends round us![_Selecting a pair of handcuffs and examining them
critically._] Them'll do.[_Slipping them into his pocket, and turning
upon HANNAH suddenly._] 'Annah!Yes, Noahry----

NOAH.Brighten oop, my darlin', the little time you 'ave me at 'ome with
you.[_She bustles about and begins to lay the cloth._

NOAH.I'm just a' goin' round to the stable to put old Nick in the cart.Oh, dont'ee trust to Nick, Noah dear--he's such a vicious brute.Nick can take me on to the edge o' the hill in half
the time.Ah, what d'ye think I've put off taking my man to Durnstone to now
for?Why, I'm a goin' to get a glimpse of the racin', on my way over.[_Opening the wicket in the cell door and looking in._] There he is![_To HANNAH._] Hopen the hoven door, 'Annah, and let the smell
of the cookin' get into him.Oh, no, Noah--it's torture![_She opens the oven door._] Torture!Whenever I get a 'old of a darned obstinate
creature wot won't reveal his hindentity I hopens the hoven door.[_He goes out into the street, and as he departs, the woful face of
THE DEAN appears at the wicket, his head being still enveloped in the
fur cap._

HANNAH.[_Shutting the oven door._] Not me!Torturing prisoners might a' done
for them Middling Ages what Noah's always clattering about, but not
for my time o' life.[_Crossing close to the
wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S.She gives a cry._]
The Dean![_He disappears._

HANNAH.[_Tottering to the wicket
and looking in._] Master!It's 'Annah, your poor faithful
servant, 'Annah![_The face of THE DEAN re-appears._

THE DEAN.[_In a deep sad voice._] Hannah Evans.It's 'Annah Topping, Knee Evans, wife o' the Constable what's goin' to
take you to cruel Durnstone.[_Sinking weeping upon the ground at the
door._] Oh, Mr.Dean, sir, what have you been up to?Woman, I am the victim of a misfortune only partially merited.[_On her knees, clasping her hands._] Tell me what you've done, Master
dear; give it a name, for the love of goodness

THE DEAN.My poor Hannah, I fear I have placed myself in an equivocal position.[_With a shriek of despair._] Ah!Is it a change o' cooking that's brought you to such ways?I cooked
for you for seven 'appy years!you seem to have lost none of your culinary skill.[_With clenched hands and a determined look._] Oh![_Quickly locking
and bolting the street door._] Noah can't put that brute of a horse to
under ten minutes.The dupplikit key o' the Strong Box![_Producing a
large key, with which she unlocks the cell door._] Master, you'll give
me your patrol not to cut, won't you?Under any other circumstances, Hannah, I should resent that
insinuation.[_Pulling the door which opens sufficiently to let out THE DEAN._

THE DEAN.[_As he enters the room._] Good day, Hannah; you have bettered
yourself, I hope?[_Hysterically flinging herself upon THE DEAN._] Oh, Master, Master![_Putting her from him sternly._] Hannah!Oh, I know, I know, but crime levels all, dear sir!You appear to misapprehend the precise degree of criminality which
attaches to me, Mrs.In the eyes of that majestic, but
imperfect instrument, the law, I am an innocent if not an injured man.Mary moved to the hallway.Stick to it, if you think it's likely to serve
your wicked ends![_Placing bread with other things on the table._

THE DEAN.My good woman, a single word from me to those at the Deanery, would
instantly restore me to home, family, and accustomed diet.Ah, they all tell that tale what comes here.Why don't you send word,
Dean dear?Because it would involve revelations of my temporary moral aberration![_Putting her apron to her eyes with a howl._] Owh!Because I should return to the Deanery with my dignity--that priceless
possession of man's middle age!--with my dignity seriously impaired!Oh, don't, sir, don't!How could I face my simple children who have hitherto, not
unreasonably, regarded me as faultless?How could I again walk erect
in the streets of St.Marvells with my name blazoned on the Records of
a Police Station of the very humblest description?[_Sinking into a chair and snatching up a piece of breads which he
begins munching._

HANNAH.[_Wiping her eyes._] Oh, sir, it's a treat to hear you, compared with
the hordinary criminal class.But, master, dear, though my Noah don't
recognize you--through his being a stranger to St.Marvells--how'll
you fare when you get to Durnstone?I have one great buoyant hope--that a word in the ear of the Durnstone
Superintendent will send me forth an unquestioned man.You and he will
be the sole keepers of my precious secret.May its possession be a
lasting comfort to you both.Master, is what you've told me your only chance of getting off
unknown?It is the sole remaining chance of averting a calamity of almost
national importance.Then you're as done as that joint in my oven!The Superintendent at Durnstone--John Ruggles--also the two
Inspectors, Whitaker and Parker----

THE DEAN.Them and their wives and families are chapel folk![_THE DEAN totters across to a chair, into which he sinks with
his head upon the table._] Master!I was well fed and kept seven years at the
Deanery--I've been wed to Noah Topping eight weeks--that's six years
and ten months' lovin' duty doo to you and yours before I owe nothing
to my darling Noah.Master dear, you shan't be took to Durnstone!Hannah Topping, formerly Evans, it is my duty to inform you
that your reasoning does more credit to your heart than to your head.The Devil's always in a woman's heart because it's
the warmest place to get to![_Taking a small key from the table
drawer._] Here, take that![_Pushing the key into the pocket of his
coat._] When you once get free from my darling Noah that key unlocks
your handcuffs!How are you to get free, that's the question now, isn't it?My Noah drives you over to Durnstone with old Nick in the cart.Now Nick was formerly in the Durnstone Fire Brigade,
and when he 'ears the familiar signal of a double whistle you can't
hold him in.[_Putting it into THE DEAN'S
pocket._] Directly you turn into Pear Tree Lane, blow once and you'll
see Noah with his nose in the air, pullin' fit to wrench his 'ands
off.Jump out--roll clear of the wheel--keep cool and 'opeful and blow
again.Before you can get the mud out of your eyes Noah and the horse
and cart will be well into Durnstone, and may Providence restore a
young 'usband safe to his doatin' wife![_Recoiling horror-stricken._

HANNAH.[_Crying._] Oh--ooh--ooh!Is this the fruit of your seven years' constant cookery at the
Deanery?I wouldn't have done it, only this is your first offence!You're not too old; I want to give you another start in life!Woman, do you think I've no conscience?Do you think I
don't realize the enormity of the--of the difficulties in alighting
from a vehicle in rapid motion?[_Opening the oven and taking out a small joint in a baking tin, which
she places on the table._] It's 'unger what makes you feel
conscientious![_Waving her away._] I have done with you!With me, sir--but not with the joint!You'll feel wickeder when you've
had a little nourishment.[_He looks hungrily at the dish._] That's
right, Dean, dear--taste my darling Noah's favorite dish.[_Advancing towards the table._] Oh, Hannah Topping--Hannah Topping![_Clutching the carving-knife despairingly._] I'll have no more women
cooks at the Deanery![_Sitting and carving with desperation._

HANNAH.You can't blow that whistle on an empty
frame.[_THE DEAN begins to eat._] Don't my cooking carry you back,
sir?Ah, if every mouthful would carry me back one little hour I would
finish this joint![_NOAH TOPPING, unperceived by HANNAH and THE DEAN, climbs in by the
window, his eyes bolting with rage--he glares round the room, taking
in everything at a glance._

NOAH.[_Under his breath._] My man o' mystery--a waited on by my nooly made
wife--a heating o' my favorite meal.[_Touching HANNAH on the arm, she turns and faces him, speechless with
fright._

THE DEAN.[_Still eating._] If my mind were calmer this would be an
all-sufficient repast.[_HANNAH tries to speak, then clasps her hands
and sinks on her knees to NOAH._] Hannah, a little plain cold water in
a simple tumbler, please.[_Grimly--folding his arms._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_HANNAH gives a
cry and clings to NOAH'S legs._

THE DEAN.[_Calmly to NOAH._] Am I to gather, constable, from your respective
attitudes that you object to these little kindnesses extended to me by
your worthy wife?I'm wishin' to know the name o' my worthy wife's friend.A friend o'
hern is a friend o' mian.She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends since we coom to St.I made this gentleman's acquaintance through the wicket, in a
casual way.Cooks and railins--cooks and railins!I might a guessed my wedded
life 'ud a coom to this.He spoke to me just as a strange gentleman ought to speak to a lady!Didn't you, sir--didn't you?Hannah, do not let us even under these circumstances prevaricate; such
is not quite the case![_NOAH advances savagely to THE DEAN.There is a knocking at the
door.--NOAH restrains himself and faces THE DEAN._

NOAH.Noa, this is neither the toime nor pla-ace, wi' people at the door and
dinner on t' table, to spill a strange man's blood.I trust that your self-respect as an officer of the law will avert
anything so unseemly.You've touched me on my point o' pride.There ain't
another police-station in all Durnstone conducted more strict and
rigid nor what mian is, and it shall so continue.You and me is a
goin' to set out for Durnstone, and when the charges now standin' agen
you is entered, it's I, Noah Topping, what'll hadd another![_There is another knock at the door._

HANNAH.The charge of allynating the affections o' my wife, 'Annah!Ay, and worse--the embezzlin' o' my mid-day meal prepared by her
'ands.[_Points into the cell._] Go in; you 'ave five minutes more in
the 'ome you 'ave ruined and laid waste.[_Going to the door and turning to NOAH._] You will at least receive
my earnest assurance that this worthy woman is extremely innocent?[_Points to the joint on the table._] Look theer!Sandra went back to the kitchen.[_THE
DEAN, much overcome, disappears through the cell door, which NOAH
closes and locks.To HANNAH,
pointing to the outer door._] Hunlock that door![_Weeping._] Oh, Noahry, you'll never be popular in St.[_HANNAH unlocks the door, and admits GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM, both
dressed for the race-course._

GEORGIANA.Take a chair, lady, near the fire.[_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Sit
down, sir.This is my first visit to a police-station, my good woman; I hope it
will be the last.Oh, don't say that, ma'am.We're honly hauxilliary 'ere, ma'am--the
Bench sets at Durnstone.I must say you try to make everybody feel at home.[_HANNAH curtseys._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HANNAH._] Perhaps this is only a police-station for the young?No, ma'am, we take ladies and gentlemen like yourselves.[_Who has not been noticed, surveying GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM,
gloomily._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_Facing NOAH._] Good gracious!'Annah's a gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week since we
coom to St.Noah, Noah--the lady and gentlemen is strange.Ay; are you seeing me on business or pleasure?Do you imagine people come here to see you?Noa--they generally coom to see my wife.'Owever, if it's business
[_pointing to the other side of the room_] that's the hofficial
side--this is domestic.SIR TRISTRAM _and_ GEORGIANA.[_Changing their seats._

SIR TRISTRAM.Tidman is the
sister of Dr.She's profligate--proceedins are pendin'![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Strange police station![_To NOAH._] Well, my good man, to come to the point.My poor friend
and this lady's brother, Dr.Jedd, the Dean, you know--has
mysteriously and unaccountably disappeared.Now, look 'ere--it's no good a gettin' 'asty and irritable with the
law.I'll coom over to yer, officially.[_Putting the baking tin under his arm he crosses over to SIR TRISTRAM
and GEORGIANA._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Putting his handkerchief to his face._] Don't bring that horrible
odor of cooking over here.It's evidence against my profligate wife.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA exchange looks of impatience._

GEORGIANA.Do you realize that my poor brother the Dean is missing?Touching this missin' De-an.I left him last night to retire to rest.'As it struck you to look in 'is bed?GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.It's only confusin'--hall doin' it![_GEORGIANA puts her handkerchief to her eyes._

SIR TRISTRAM.This is his sister--I am his
friend!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.A the'ry that will put you all out o' suspense!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I've been a good bit about, I read a deal, and I'm a shrewd
experienced man.I should say this is nothin' but a hordinary case of
sooicide.[_GEORGIANA sits faintly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Savagely to NOAH._] Get out of the way!Oh, Tris, if this were true how could we break it to the girls?I could run oop, durin' the evenin', and break it to the girls.[_Turns upon NOAH._] Look here, all you've got to do is to hold your
tongue and take down my description of the Dean, and report his
disappearance at Durnstone.[_Pushing him into a chair._] Go on!The Very Reverend Augustin Jedd, Dean of St.[_Softly to GEORGIANA._] Lady, lady.[_NOAH prepares to write, depositing the baking-tin on the table._

GEORGIANA.[_Speaks to GEORGIANA excitedly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To NOAH._] Have you got that?[_Writing laboriously with his legs curled round the chair and his
head on the table._] Ay.I suppose he was jest the hordinary sort o' lookin' man.[_Turning from HANNAH, excitedly._] Description--a little, short, thin
man, with black hair and a squint![_To GEORGIANA._] No, no, he isn't.I'm Gus's sister--I ought to know what he's like!Good heavens, Georgiana--your mind is not going?[_Clutching SIR TRISTRAM'S arm and whispering in his ear, as she
points to the cell door._] He's in there!Gus is the villain found dosing Dandy Dick last night![_HANNAH seizes SIR TRISTRAM and talks to him
rapidly._] [_To NOAH._] What have you written?I've written "Hanswers to the name o' Gus!"[_Snatching the paper from him._] It's not wanted.I'm too busy to bother about him this week.Look here--you're the constable who took the man in the Deanery
Stables last night?[_Looking out of the window._] There's my cart outside ready to
take the scoundrel over to Durnstone.[_He tucks the baking-tin under his arm and goes up to the cell door._

GEORGIANA.[_To herself._] Oh, Gus, Gus![_Unlocking the door._] I warn yer.[_NOAH goes into the cell, closing the door after him._

Tris!What was my brother's motive in bolusing Dandy last night?The first thing to do is to get him out of this hole.But we can't trust to Gus rolling out of a flying dogcart!Why, it's
as much as I could do!Oh, yes, lady, he'll do it.There's another--a awfuller charge hangin' over his
reverend 'ead.To think my own stock should run vicious like this.[_NOAH comes out of the cell with THE DEAN, who is in handcuffs._

GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_Raising his eyes, sees SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA, and recoils with
a groan, sinking on to a chair._] Oh!I am the owner of the horse stabled at the Deanery.I
make no charge against this wretched person.[_To THE DEAN._] Oh man,
man!I was discovered administering to a suffering beast a simple remedy
for chills.The analysis hasn't come home from the chemist's yet.[_To NOAH._] Release this man.He was found trespassin' in the stables of the la-ate
De-an, who has committed sooicide.I----

SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.The Diseased De-an is the honly man wot can withdraw one charge----

THE DEAN.SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.And I'm the honly man wot can withdraw the other.I charge this person unknown with allynating the affections o' my wife
while I was puttin' my 'orse to.And I'm goin' to drive him over to
Durnstone with the hevidence.Oh lady, lady, it's appearances what is against us.[_Through the opening of the door._] Woa![_Whispering to THE DEAN._] I am disappointed in you, Angustin.Have
you got this wretched woman's whistle?[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call
Principles![_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop.May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked?In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is
problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the
husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if
not admiration.As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be
reserved for another time--another place.[_To GEORGIANA._] To you,
whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I
give this earnest admonition.Within an hour from this terrible
moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing
man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared.[_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._

GEORGIANA.Oh, what am I to think of my brother?[_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think!That he's the beautifullest,
sweetest man in all Durnshire!It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring
him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed.Not a soul but we three'll
ever know of his misfortune.[_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done
for!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and
left Old Nick at home!_The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._

_SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._

SALOME.In the meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no
cause for self-reproach.[_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this
suspense I want you to have my workbox.[_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] Thank you, dear, but if
Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me.[_Turning towards the window as MAJOR TARVER and MR.DARBEY appear
outside._

DARBEY.[_SALOME unfastens the window._

DARBEY.Don't be shocked when you see Tarver._TARVER and DARBEY enter, dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is
supporting TARVER, who looks extremely weakly._

TARVER.You do well, gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment
of sorrow.One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the
bell, to ring for help.[_TARVER sinks into a chair._

DARBEY.[_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now.Miss Jedd,
that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition.Feeling that he
has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to
gain the race-course.Middleton and I
explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_]
second only to my own.[_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you,
Mr.[_The two girls exchange looks._

DARBEY.The Doctor made a searching examination of the Major's tongue and
diagnosed that, unless the Major at once proposed to the lady in
question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside would
be absolutely imperative.We are curious to see to what lengths you will go.The pitiable condition of my poor friend speaks for itself.I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind.[_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have
loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks.[_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat
firmly_] let me pass, I say.[_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._

TARVER.To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or
it is an admirable digestive.Accept me, and my merry laugh once more
rings through the Mess Room.Reject me, and my collection of vocal
music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the
bird, as it were, will trill no more.And is it really I who would hush the little throaty songster?[_Taking a sheet of paper from his pocket._] I have the
Doctor's certificate to that effect.[_Both reading the certificate they walk into Library._

SHEBA.Darbey, I have never thought of marriage seriously.People never do till they _are_ married.Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age?Oh, it is so very little--it is not worth mentioning.Cannot we remain
friends and occasionally correspond?Well, of course--if you insist----

SHEBA.No, no, I see that is impracticable.All I ask
is time--time to ponder over such a question, time to know myself
better.[_They separate as TARVER and SALOME re-enter the room.TARVER is
glaring excitedly and biting his nails._

TARVER.I never thought I should live to be accepted by anyone.DARBEY _and_ TARVER.Oh, what do you think of it, Mr.Shocking, but we oughtn't to condemn him unheard.[_At the window._] Here's Aunt Georgiana![_Going out quickly._

SALOME.[_Pulling TARVER after her._] Come this way and let us take cuttings
in the conservatory.[_They go out._

SHEBA.Darbey, wait for me--I have decided._Yes._

[_She goes out by the door as GEORGIANA enters excitedly at the
window._

GEORGIANA.[_Waving her handkerchief._] Come on, Tris!_SIR TRISTRAM and HATCHAM enter by the window carrying THE DEAN.They
all look as though they have been recently engaged in a prolonged
struggle._

SIR TRISTRAM.That I will, ma'am, and gladly.[_They deposit THE DEAN in a chair and GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM each
seize a hand, feeling THE DEAN'S pulse, while HATCHAM puts
