If
her father is still here, I think he’d better go at once to her place,
and see about her.”

The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben
Lawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as
the responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the
hallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank
face.He assented with readiness to Reuben’s idea, when it was explained to
him.“So she druv out to your mother’s place for you, did she?” he commented,
admiringly.“That girl’s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,” he
added, with an apologetic smile, “of the old, old block.I ain’t got so
much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
regular snorter!”

“We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,” said
Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.“Be sure that you tell your
daughter, too, how grateful we all are.”

Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
with formal awkwardness.“I didn’t seem to do much,” he said, deprecatingly, “and perhaps I
wouldn’t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin’
and gougin’ and wras’lin’ round generally.But you can bet your boots,
ma’am, that I’d a-done what I could!”

With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
before.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,
and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.“If you will give me your arm,” she said, in a delicious murmur, “we
will go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us
there.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have
one to-night.”




CHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben’s eyes was like a vista of
fairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold
frames and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,
contributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of
the table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which
fell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and
softened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished
gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues
from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here
which gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,
and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which
can make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or
twice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was
in his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably
his future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted
path--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even
entertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward
to self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and
thereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them
to be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
disconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the
reflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced
breathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd
outside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at
the head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica’s ride, of her
fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this
he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he
had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
morning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
would summarily take.“So far as I can see, Mrs.Minster,” he concluded, when the servant
had again left the room, “no real loss will result from this whole
imbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared
up; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority
interest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not
entirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that
you will come out winner.”

Mrs.“My daughters thought that I knew
nothing about business!” she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the
matter undiscussed.“And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?” asked Ethel,
from Reuben’s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
bitterness had evaporated.“Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
they committed,” he said.“If only as a duty to the public, they should
be prosecuted.”

He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes
met, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:

“Of course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself
with the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I
was full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to
be punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even
tell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage
in settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand
jury.”

“That is a consideration which we won’t discuss,” said Kate.“If my mind
were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
decision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking
a great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce
was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.”

“Yes; I know.” Reuben bowed his head gravely.“Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.”

“No doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
youngster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits
came to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than
them.”

“Precisely,” urged Kate.“Credulous is just the word.He was weak,
foolish, vain--whatever you like.But I
don’t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,”
 the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, “to be frank, there are
reasons for my thinking so.”

Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
mirrored that feeling in his glance.“I quite follow you,” he said.“It is my notion that he was deceived, at
the beginning.”

“Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,” responded
Kate.“And that is why,” put in Ethel, “we feel like asking you not to take
the matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would
be too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,
and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange
Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into
prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down
on a treadmill.No; we mustn’t do that, Mr.Tracy.”

Kate added musingly: “He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
can we not?”

Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except “yes.”
 His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover’s interpretation of this
speech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words
about allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a
final decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the
table knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the
atmosphere grew lighter.“And now for the real thing,” said Kate, gayly.“I am commissioned on
behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our
rescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in
the library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were
in such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn’t tell her when you
began--but she couldn’t help hearing the horns, and she is as much
obliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!”

“Yes, indeed,” assented Mrs.“I don’t know where the police
were, at all.”

“The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been
here,” said Reuben.“The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and
discreditable in its way, but I don’t really imagine there was ever any
actual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works
and the importation of the French Canadians, and I don’t blame them;
but as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.Sandra moved to the bathroom.My own notion is
that the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve
in frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn’t know
what to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn’t an American
institution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals
to reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they
were quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.”

“Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
promptly,” said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: “Yes, Mrs.And so they must
be opened, on Monday.It is my dearest
wish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to
make a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we
should defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it
can.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and
who can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not
dare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian
of your interests quite as much as of your daughters’.I am very proud
and happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for
acting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot
now be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.”

“Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,” said Ethel,
merrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
considerable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
brought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,
was gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There
had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt
that he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that
were past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to
minister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of
attention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the
family had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy
had surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary
to keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one
another, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent
than spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world
had shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened
light was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,
of romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it
was centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark
upon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of
smiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely
prompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone
away, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He
held her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed
his lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect
again, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel’s
face, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal
dreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,
trembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
the path to the street.bless you!” was what the song-birds
carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
said, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
progress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was
there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
universe?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air
was colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
winter.To the lover’s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked
themselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward
glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
onward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****

At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
which lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama
spread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his
cane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and
his brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
passed, “Hello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn’t it?” and had only
an inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories
of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and
General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That
Horace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only
too evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal
roof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but
indulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and
quip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him
like a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful
weakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and
to their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked
disgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but
winks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when
he came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very
vagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
which encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily
noted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the
snow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out
late.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which
gave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,
obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
arms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an
instant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped
it, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the
reverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,
unlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up
the gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very
ill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
Dr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--“I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!”

 Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed
by stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet
volatile sense of comfort.Jessica’s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
gigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no
impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it
finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
understanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness
before her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves
gradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still
downward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted
lily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely
apparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered
over these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came
through them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at
its disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her
dim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed
weeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her
was the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending
from it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at
it.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at
all.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of
a man’s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,
and thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not
to be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light
flashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She
knew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised
that he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about
things, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and
did not dream of speaking.“Are you better?” she heard him eagerly whisper.“Are you in pain?”

The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
troubled her remotely.She made some faint nodding motion of her head
and eyes, and then lay perfectly still again.She could hear the sound
of her own breathing--a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through
a comb--and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
heavy ache in her breast.Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
remembering things.The pictures came slowly, taking form with a
fantastic absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced
the effect of a recollection upon her mind.The starting point--and
everything else that went before that terrible sinking, despairing
struggle through the wet snow--was missing.She recalled most vividly
of all being seized with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness
and choking--her throat and chest all afire with the tortures of
suffocation.It was under a lamp-post, she remembered; and when the
vehement coughing was over, her mouth was full of blood, and there were
terrifying crimson spatters on the snow.She had stood aghast at this,
and then fallen to weeping piteously to herself with fright.How strange
it was--in the anguish of that moment she had moaned out, “O mother,
mother!” and yet she had never seen that parent, and had scarcely
thought of her memory even for many, many years.Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing
like leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart.She had
fallen in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
blackness and collapse.She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at
recollection had caused.Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided,
to a dream of the buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow
like the stertorous sound of her own breathing.The bee--a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
back and thighs--had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit enough
to go out again.Some of the children were giggling over this, but
she would not join them because Mr.Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
platform, did not wish it.Already
she delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of
the other girls--scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
have.Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains
tricked out with imitation garlands.They were worn now by older
girls--hard-faced, jealous, cruel creatures--and these sat in a room
with lace curtains and luxurious furniture.And some laughed with a ring
like brass in their voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some
cursed their God and all living things; and there was the odor of wine
and the uproar of the piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and
terror.Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil
fangs of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened
ears, led to a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting
sun spread a red light among the big tree-trunks.Against this deep,
far-distant sky there was the figure of a man coming.For him she waited
with a song in her heart.It was Reuben Tracy, and
he was too gentle and good not to see her when he passed.She would call
out to him--and lo!Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with
terrified longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him for the
awful dumbness that was on them.And when he, refusing to see them,
spread out his arms in anger, the whole great forest began to sway and
circle dizzily, and huge trees toppled, rocks crashed downward, gaunt
giant reptiles rose from yawning caves with hideous slimy eyes in a
lurid ring about her.And she would save Horace with her life, and
fought like mad, bleeding and maimed and frenzied, until the weight
of mountains piled upon her breast held her down in helpless, choking
horror.Then only came the power to scream, and--

Out of the roar of confusion and darkness came suddenly a hush and the
return of light.She was lying in the curtained bed, and a tender hand
was pressing soft cool linen to her lips.Opening her eyes in tranquil weakness, she saw two men standing at her
bedside.He who held the cloth in his hand was Dr.Lester, whom she
remembered very well.The other--he whose head was bowed, and whose eyes
were fastened upon hers with a pained and affrighted gaze--was Horace
Boyce.In her soul she smiled at him, but no answering softness came to his
harrowed face.“I told your father everything,” she heard the doctor say in a low tone.I happened to have attended her, by
the merest chance, when her child was born.”

“Her child?” the other asked, in the same low, far-away voice.He is in Thessaly now, a boy nearly six years
old.”

“Good God!I never knew--”

“You seem to have taken precious good care not to know,” said the
doctor, with grave dislike.“This is the time and place to speak plainly
to you, Boyce.This poor girl has come to her death through the effort
to save you from disgrace.She supposed you lived here, and dragged
herself here to help you.” Jessica heard the sentence of doom without
even a passing thought.Every energy left in her feebly fluttering
brain was concentrated upon the question, _Is_ he saved?Vaguely the
circumstances of the papers, of the threats against Horace, of her
desires and actions, seemed to come back to her memory.She waited in
dazed suspense to hear what Horace would say; but he only hung his head
the lower, and left the doctor to go on.“She raved for hours last night,” he said, “after the women had got her
to bed, and we had raised her out of the comatose state, about saving
you from State prison.First she would plead with Tracy, then she would
appeal to you to fly, and so backwards and forwards, until she wore
herself out.The papers she had got hold of--they must have slipped out
of Gedney’s pocket into the sleigh.I suppose you know that I took them
back to Tracy this morning?”

Still Horace made no answer, but bent that crushed and vacant gaze
upon her face.She marvelled that he could not see she was awake and
conscious, and still more that the strength and will to speak were
withheld from her.The dreadful pressure upon her breast was making
itself felt again, and the painful sound of the labored breathing took
on the sombre rhythm of a distant death-chant.No: still the doctor went on:

“Tracy will be here in a few minutes.He’s terribly upset by the thing,
and has gone first to tell the news at the Minsters’.Do you want to see
him when he comes?”

“I don’t know what I want,” said Horace, gloomily.“If I were you, I would go straight to him and say frankly, ‘I have been
a damned fool, and a still damneder hypocrite, and I throw myself on
your mercy.’ He’s the tenderest-hearted man alive, and this sight here
will move him.Upon my word, I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes
myself.”

Jessica saw as through a mist that these two men’s faces, turned upon
her, were softened with a deep compassion.Then suddenly the power to
speak came to her.It was a puny and unnatural voice which fell upon her
ears--low and hoarsely grating, and the product of much pain.“Go away--doctor,” she murmured.“Leave him here.”

Horace sat softly upon the edge of the bed, and gathered her two hands
tenderly in his.He did not attempt to keep back the tears which welled
to his eyes, nor did he try to talk.Thus they were together for what
seemed a long time, surrounded by a silence which was full of voices
to them both.A wan smile settled upon her face as she held him in her
intent gaze.“Take the boy,” she whispered at last; “he is Horace, too.Don’t let him
lie--ever--to any girl.”

The young man groaned in spite of himself, and for answer gently pressed
her hands.“I promise you that, Jess,” he said, after a time, in a
broken voice.He bent over and kissed her on the forehead.The damp
roughness of the skin chilled and terrified him, but the radiance on her
face deepened.“It hurts--to breathe,” she said, after a time with a glance of
affectionate apology in her smile.Subdued noises were faintly heard now in the hallway outside, and
presently the door was opened cautiously, and a tall new figure entered
the room.After a moment’s hesitation Reuben Tracy tiptoed his way to
the bedside, and stood gravely behind and above his former partner.“Is she conscious?” he asked of Boyce, in a tremulous whisper; and
Horace, bending his head still lower, murmured between choking sobs: “It
is Mr.Tracy, Jess, come to say--to see you.”

Her eyes brightened with intelligence.“Good--good,” she said, slowly,
as if musing to herself.The gaze which she fastened upon Reuben’s face
was strangely full of intense meaning, and he felt it piercing his
very heart.Minutes went by under the strain of this deep, half-wild,
appealing look.At last she spoke, with a greater effort at distinctness
than before, and in a momentarily clearer tone.“You were always kind,” she said.“Don’t hurt--my boy.Shake hands with
him--for my sake.”

The two young men obeyed mechanically, after an instant’s pause, and
without looking at each other.Neither had eyes save for the white face
on the pillows in front of them, and for the gladdened, restful light
which spread softly over it as their hands touched in amity before her
vision.In the languor of peace which had come to possess her, even the sense of
pain in breathing was gone.There were shadowy figures on the retina of
her brain, but they conveyed no idea save of general beatitude to her
mind.The space in which her senses floated was radiant and warm and
full of formless beauty.Various individuals--types of her loosening
ties to life--came and went almost unheeded in this daze.Lucinda, vehemently weeping, and holding the little fair-haired,
wondering boy over the bed for her final kiss, passed away like a
dissolving mist.Her father’s face, too, dawned upon this dream,
tear-stained and woful, and faded again into nothingness.Other flitting
apparitions there were, even more vague and brief, melting noiselessly
into the darkened hush.The unclouded calm of this lethargy grew troubled presently when there
fell upon her dulled ear the low tones of a remembered woman’s voice.Enough of consciousness flickered up to tell her whose it was.She
strained her eyes in the gathering shadows to see Kate Minster, and
began restlessly to roll her head upon the pillow.“Where--where--_her?_” she moaned, striving to stretch forth her hand.It was lifted and held softly in a tender grasp, and she felt as well
a compassionate stroking touch laid upon her forehead.The gentle
magnetism of these helped the dying girl to bring into momentary being
the image of a countenance close above hers--a dark, beautiful face, all
melting now with affection and grief.She smiled faintly into this face,
and lay still again for a long time.The breathing grew terribly shorter
and more labored, the light faded.And do you
remember that silly old pair of black trousers that used to get so thin
on the knees and how I used to put shoe-blacking underneath so the white
wouldn't show through?"By this time her arm managed to get around his
neck.shrieked Alfred as though mortal man could endure no more."You've used those trousers to settle every crisis in our lives."Zoie gazed at him without daring to breathe; even she was aghast at his
fury, but only temporarily.She recovered herself and continued sweetly:

"If everything is SETTLED," she argued, "where's the harm in talking?""We've DONE with talking," declared Alfred.And determined not to be cheated out of this final decision, he again
started for the hall door.cried Zoie in a tone of sharp alarm.In spite of himself Alfred turned to learn the cause of her anxiety."You haven't got your overshoes on," she said.Speechless with rage, Alfred continued on his way, but Zoie moved before
him swiftly."I'll get them for you, dear," she volunteered graciously."I wish you wouldn't roar like that," pouted Zoie, and the pink tips of
her fingers were thrust tight against her ears.Alfred drew in his breath and endeavoured for the last time to repress
his indignation."Either you can't, or you won't understand that it is
extremely unpleasant for me to even talk to you--much less to receive
your attentions.""Very likely," answered Zoie, unperturbed."But so long as I am your
lawful wedded wife----" she emphasised the "lawful"--"I shan't let any
harm come to you, if _I_ can help it."She lifted her eyes to heaven
bidding it to bear witness to her martyrdom and looking for all the
world like a stained glass saint.shouted Alfred, almost hysterical at his apparent failure to
make himself understood."You wouldn't let any harm come to me.You've only made me the greatest joke in Chicago," he shouted."You've
only made me such a laughing stock that I have to leave it.Then regaining her
self-composure, she edged her way close to him and looked up into his
eyes in baby-like wonderment."Why, Allie, where are we going?"Her
small arm crept up toward his shoulder.Alfred pushed it from him
rudely."WE are not going," he asserted in a firm, measured voice.And again he started in search of his absent
headgear.she exclaimed, and this time there was genuine alarm in her
voice, "you wouldn't leave me?"Before he knew it, Zoie's arms
were about him--she was pleading desperately."Now see here, Allie, you may call me all the names you like," she cried
with great self-abasement, "but you shan't--you SHAN'T go away from
Chicago."answered Alfred as he shook himself free of her."I
suppose you'd like me to go on with this cat and dog existence.You'd
like me to stay right here and pay the bills and take care of you, while
you flirt with every Tom, Dick and Harry in town.""It's only your horrid disposition that makes you talk like that,"
whimpered Zoie."You know very well that I never cared for anybody but
you.""Until you GOT me, yes," assented Alfred, "and NOW you care for
everybody BUT me."She was about to object, but he continued quickly."Where you MEET your gentlemen friends is beyond me._I_ don't introduce
them to you.""I should say not," agreed Zoie, and there was a touch of vindictiveness
in her voice."The only male creature that you ever introduced to me was
the family dog.""I introduce every man who's fit to meet you," declared Alfred with an
air of great pride."That doesn't speak very well for your acquaintances," snipped Zoie."I won't bicker like this," declared Alfred."That's what you always say, when you can't think of an answer,"
retorted Zoie."You mean when I'm tired of answering your nonsense!"CHAPTER IX

Realising that she was rapidly losing ground by exercising her advantage
over Alfred in the matter of quick retort, Zoie, with her customary
cunning, veered round to a more conciliatory tone."Well," she cooed,
"suppose I DID eat lunch with a man?"shrieked Alfred, as though he had at last run his victim to earth."I only said suppose," she
reminded him quickly.Then she continued in a tone meant to draw from
him his heart's most secret confidence."Didn't you ever eat lunch with
any woman but me?"There was an unmistakable expression of pleasure on Zoie's small face,
but she forced back the smile that was trying to creep round her lips,
and sidled toward Alfred, with eyes properly downcast."Then I'm very
sorry I did it," she said solemnly, "and I'll never do it again.""Just to please you, dear," explained Zoie sweetly, as though she were
doing him the greatest possible favour."Do you suppose it pleases me to know
that you are carrying on the moment my back is turned, making a fool of
me to my friends?"This time it was her turn to be
angry.It's your FRIENDS that are worrying you!"In her excitement
she tossed Alfred's now damaged hat into the chair just behind her.He
was far too overwrought to see it."_I_ haven't done you any harm," she
continued wildly."It's only what you think your friends think."repeated Alfred, in her same tragic key,
"Oh no!You've only cheated me out of everything I expected to
get out of life!Zoie came to a full stop and waited for him to enumerate the various
treasures that he had lost by marrying her."Before we were married," he continued, "you pretended to adore
children.You started your humbugging the first day I met you.Alfred continued:

"I was fool enough to let you know that I admire women who like
children.From that day until the hour that I led you to the altar,
you'd fondle the ugliest little brats that we met in the street, but the
moment you GOT me----"

"Alfred!"shouted Alfred, pounding the table with his fist for
emphasis."The moment you GOT me, you declared that all children were
horrid little insects, and that someone ought to sprinkle bug-powder on
them."protested Zoie, shocked less by Alfred's interpretation of her
sentiments, than by the vulgarity with which he expressed them."On another occasion," declared Alfred, now carried away by the recital
of his long pent up wrongs, "you told me that all babies should be put
in cages, shipped West, and kept in pens until they got to be of an
interesting age.he repeated with a sneer, "meaning
old enough to take YOU out to luncheon, I suppose.""I never said any such thing," objected Zoie."Well, that was the idea," insisted Alfred."I haven't your glib way of
expressing myself.""You manage to express yourself very well," retorted Zoie."When
you have anything DISAGREEABLE to say.As for babies," she continued
tentatively, "I think they are all very well in their PLACE, but they
were NEVER meant for an APARTMENT.""I offered you a house in the country," shouted Alfred."How could I live in the country, with
people being murdered in their beds every night?"Always an excuse," sighed Alfred resignedly."There always HAS been
and there always would be if I'd stay to listen.Well, for once," he
declared, "I'm glad that we have no children.If we had, I might feel
some obligation to keep up this farce of a marriage.As it is," he
continued, "YOU are free and _I_ am free."And with a courtly wave of
his arm, he dismissed Zoie and the entire subject, and again he started
in pursuit of Mary and his hat."If it's your freedom you wish," pouted Zoie with an abused air, "you
might have said so in the first place."Alfred stopped in sheer amazement at the cleverness with which the
little minx turned his every statement against him."It's not very manly of you," she continued, "to abuse me just because
you've found someone whom you like better.""That's not true," protested Alfred hotly, "and you know it's not true."Little did he suspect the trap into which she was leading him."Then you DON'T love anybody more than you do me?"she cried eagerly,
and she gazed up at him with adoring eyes."I didn't say any such thing," hedged Alfred."I DON'T," he declared in self defence.With a cry of joy, she sprang into his arms, clasped her fingers tightly
behind his neck, and rained impulsive kisses upon his unsuspecting face.For an instant, Alfred looked down at Zoie, undecided whether to
strangle her or to return her embraces.As usual, his self-respect won
the day for him and, with a determined effort, he lifted her high in the
air, so that she lost her tenacious hold of him, and sat her down with
a thud in the very same chair in which she had lately dropped his hat.Having acted with this admirable resolution, he strode majestically
toward the inner hall, but before he could reach it, Zoie was again
on her feet, in a last vain effort to conciliate him.Turning, Alfred
caught sight of his poor battered hat.Snatching it up with one hand, and throwing his latchkey on the
table with the other, he made determinedly for the outer door.Screaming hysterically, Zoie caught him just as he reached the threshold
and threw the whole weight of her body upon him."Alfred," she pleaded, "if you REALLY love me, you CAN'T leave me like
this!"He looked down at her gravely--then
into the future."There are other things more important than what YOU call 'love,'" he
said, very solemnly."There is such a thing as a soul, if you only knew it.And you have hurt
mine through and through."asked the small person, and there was a frown of
genuine perplexity on her tiny puckered brow."What have I REALLY DONE,"
She stroked his hand fondly; her baby eyes searched his face."It isn't so much what people DO to us that counts," answered Alfred in
a proud hurt voice."It's how much they DISAPPOINT us in what they do.I
expected better of YOU," he said sadly."I'll DO better," coaxed Zoie, "if you'll only give me a chance.""Now, Allie," she pleaded, perceiving that his resentment was dying and
resolved to, at last, adopt a straight course, "if you'll only listen,
I'll tell you the REAL TRUTH."Unprepared for the electrical effect of her remark, Zoie found herself
staggering to keep her feet.His arms
were lifted to Heaven, his breath was coming fast.he gasped, then bringing his crushed hat down on his
forehead with a resounding whack, he rushed from her sight.The clang of the closing elevator door brought Zoie to a realisation of
what had actually happened.Determined that Alfred should not escape
her she rushed to the hall door and called to him wildly.Running back to the room, she threw open the window and threw
herself half out of it.She was just in time to see Alfred climb into
a passing taxi.Then automatically she flew to the
'phone."Give me 4302 Main," she called and she tried to force back her
tears."I wish you'd ring me up the moment my husband comes in."There was a
slight pause, then she clutched the receiver harder.She
let the receiver fall back on the hook and her head went forward on her
outstretched arms.CHAPTER X

When Jimmy came home to luncheon that day, Aggie succeeded in getting a
general idea of the state of affairs in the Hardy household.Of course
Jimmy didn't tell the whole truth.In fact, he
appeared to be aggravatingly ignorant as to the exact cause of the Hardy
upheaval.Of ONE thing, however, he was certain."Alfred was going to
quit Chicago and leave Zoie to her own devices."and before Jimmy was fairly out of
the front gate, she had seized her hat and gloves and rushed to the
rescue of her friend.Not surprised at finding Zoie in a state of collapse, Aggie opened her
arms sympathetically to receive the weeping confidences that she was
sure would soon come."Zoie dear," she said as the fragile mite rocked to and fro.She pressed the soft ringlets from the girl's throbbing forehead."It's Alfred," sobbed Zoie."Yes, I know," answered Aggie tenderly.questioned Zoie, and she lifted her head and
regarded Aggie with sudden uneasiness.Her friend's answer raised Jimmy
considerably in Zoie's esteem.Apparently he had not breathed a word
about the luncheon."Why, Jimmy told me," continued Aggie, "that you and Alfred had had
another tiff, and that Alfred had gone for good."echoed Zoie and her eyes were wide with terror.cried Zoie, at last fully convinced of the strength
of Alfred's resolve."But he shan't," she declared emphatically.He has no right----" By this time she
was running aimlessly about the room.asked Aggie, feeling sure that Zoie was as
usual at fault."Nothing," answered Zoie with wide innocent eyes.echoed Aggie, with little confidence in her friend's ability
to judge impartially about so personal a matter.And there was no doubting that she
at least believed it."What does he SAY," questioned Aggie diplomatically."He SAYS I 'hurt his soul.'Whatever THAT is," answered Zoie, and
her face wore an injured expression."Isn't that a nice excuse," she
continued, "for leaving your lawful wedded wife?"It was apparent that
she expected Aggie to rally strongly to her defence.But at present
Aggie was bent upon getting facts."I ate lunch," said Zoie with the face of a cherub.She was beginning to scent the
probable origin of the misunderstanding."It's of no consequence," answered Zoie carelessly; "I wouldn't have
wiped my feet on the man."By this time she had entirely forgotten
Aggie's proprietorship in the source of her trouble.urged Aggie, and in her mind, she had already
condemned him as a low, unprincipled creature."It's ANY man with
Alfred--you know that--ANY man!"Aggie sank in a chair and looked at her friend in despair."Why DO you
do these things," she said wearily, "when you know how Alfred feels
about them?""You talk as though I did nothing else," answered Zoie with an aggrieved
tone."It's the first time since I've been married that I've ever eaten
lunch with any man but Alfred.I thought you'd have a little sympathy
with me," she whimpered, "instead of putting me on the gridiron like
everyone else does.""HE'S 'everyone else' to me."And then
with a sudden abandonment of grief, she threw herself prostrate at her
friend's knees."Oh, Aggie, what can I do?"But Aggie was not satisfied with Zoie's fragmentary account of her
latest escapade."Is that the only thing that Alfred has against you?""That's the LATEST," sniffled Zoie, in a heap at Aggie's feet.And then
she continued in a much aggrieved tone, "You know he's ALWAYS rowing
because we haven't as many babies as the cook has cats.""Well, why don't you get him a baby?"asked the practical, far-seeing
Aggie."It's too late NOW," moaned Zoie."It's the very thing that would bring him
back."questioned Zoie, and she looked up at Aggie with
round astonished eyes."Adopt it," answered Aggie decisively.Zoie regarded her friend with mingled disgust and disappointment."No,"
she said with a sigh and a shake of her head, "that wouldn't do any
good."He needn't know," declared Aggie boldly.Drawing herself up with an air of great importance, and regarding the
wondering young person at her knee with smiling condescension, Aggie
prepared to make a most interesting disclosure."There was a long article in the paper only this morning," she told
Zoie, "saying that three thousand husbands in this VERY CITY are
fondling babies not their own."Zoie turned her small head to one side, the better to study Aggie's
face.It was apparent to the latter that she must be much more explicit."Babies adopted in their absence," explained Aggie, "while they were on
trips around the country."A dangerous light began to glitter in Zoie's eyes.she cried, bringing her small hands together excitedly, "do you
think I COULD?"asked Aggie, with a very superior air.Zoie's enthusiasm was
increasing her friend's admiration of her own scheme."This same paper
tells of a woman who adopted three sons while her husband was in Europe,
and he thinks each one of them is his."cried Zoie, now thoroughly enamoured of the
idea."You can always get TONS of them at the Children's Home," answered Aggie
confidently."I can't endure babies," declared Zoie, "but I'd do ANYTHING to get
Alfred back.Aggie looked at her small friend with positive pity."You don't WANT one
TO-DAY," she explained.Zoie rolled her large eyes inquiringly."If you were to get one to-day," continued Aggie, "Alfred would know it
wasn't yours, wouldn't he?"A light of understanding began to show on Zoie's small features."There was none when he left this morning," added Aggie."That's true," acquiesced Zoie."You must wait awhile," counselled Aggie, "and then get a perfectly new
one."But Zoie had never been taught to wait."After a few months," she explained, "when Alfred's temper has had time
to cool, we'll get Jimmy to send him a wire that he has an heir."exclaimed Zoie, as though Aggie had suggested an
eternity."I've never been away from Alfred that long in all my life.""Well, of course," she said coldly, as she
rose to go, "if you can get Alfred back WITHOUT that----"

"But I can't!"cried Zoie, and she clung to her friend as to her last
remaining hope."Then," answered Aggie, somewhat mollified by Zoie's complete
submission.The President of the Children's Home
is a great friend of Jimmy's," she said proudly.It was at this point that Zoie made her first practical suggestion."Then we'll LET JIMMY GET IT," she declared."Of course," agreed Aggie enthusiastically, as though they would be
according the poor soul a rare privilege."Jimmy gives a hundred
dollars to the Home every Christmas,"--additional proof why he should be
selected for this very important office."If Alfred were to
give a hundred dollars to a Baby's Home, I should suspect him."In spite of her firm faith in
Jimmy's innocence, she was undoubtedly annoyed by Zoie's unpleasant
suggestion.There was an instant's pause, then putting disagreeable thoughts from
her mind, Aggie turned to Zoie with renewed enthusiasm."We must get down to business," she said, "we'll begin on the baby's
outfit at once."exclaimed Zoie, and she clapped her hands merrily like a
very small child.A moment later she stopped with sudden misgiving."But, Aggie," she said fearfully, "suppose Alfred shouldn't come back
after I've got the baby?"Oh, he's sure to come back!""He'll take the first train, home.""I believe he will," assented Zoie joyfully."Aggie," she cried impulsively, "you are a darling.And she clasped her arms so tightly around Aggie's
neck that her friend was in danger of being suffocated.Releasing herself Aggie continued with a ruffled collar and raised
vanity: "You can write him an insinuating letter now and then, just to
lead up to the good news gradually."Zoie tipped her small head to one side and studied her friend
thoughtfully."Do you know, Aggie," she said, with frank admiration, "I
believe you are a better liar than I am.""I'm NOT a liar," objected Aggie vehemently, "at least, not often," she
corrected."I've never lied to Jimmy in all my life.""And Jimmy has NEVER LIED TO ME.""Isn't that nice," sniffed Zoie and she pretended to be searching for
her pocket-handkerchief."But, Aggie----" protested Zoie, unwilling to be left alone."I'll run in again at tea time," promised Aggie."I don't mind the DAYS," whined Zoie, "but when NIGHT comes I just MUST
have somebody's arms around me."gasped Aggie, both shocked and alarmed."I can't help it," confessed Zoie; "the moment it gets dark I'm just
scared stiff.""That's no way for a MOTHER to talk," reproved Aggie.exclaimed Zoie, horrified at the sudden realisation that
this awful appellation would undoubtedly pursue her for the rest of
her life."Oh, don't call me that," she pleaded."You make me feel a
thousand years old.""Nonsense," laughed Aggie, and before Zoie could again detain her she
was out of the room.When the outside door had closed behind her friend, Zoie gazed about
the room disconsolately, but her depression was short-lived.Remembering
Aggie's permission about the letter, she ran quickly to the writing
table, curled her small self up on one foot, placed a brand new pen in
the holder, then drew a sheet of paper toward her and, with shoulders
hunched high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a
child, she began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications
that were ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement.CHAPTER XI

When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie, his
subsequent encounter with Alfred, and his enforced luncheon at home
with Aggie, he found his mail, his 'phone calls, and his neglected
appointments in a state of hopeless congestion, and try as he would, he
could not concentrate upon their disentanglement.Growing more and more
furious with the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his
desk, looking down upon him expectantly, and waiting for his tardy
instructions, Jimmy rose and looked out of the window.He could feel
Andrew's reproachful eyes following him."Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now?"asked Andrew, and he
wondered how late the office staff would be kept to-night to make up for
the time that was now being wasted.Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest, Andrew's
implied reproach was too much for Jimmy's overwrought nerves.And when Andrew could assure himself that
he had heard aright, he stalked out of the door with his head high in
the air.Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred.It was
apparent to him that the whole world was against him.His family, friends, and business associates
had undoubtedly lost all respect for him.From this day forth he was
determined to show himself to be a man of strong mettle.Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he
was about to start on a new life, Jimmy strode to the door of the office
and, without disturbing the injured Andrew, he called sharply to Miss
Perkins to come at once and take his letters.Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of
the "cut-glass" industry.Invariably his mind would wander back to the
unexpected incidents of the morning.Stopping suddenly in the middle of
a letter to a competing firm, he began pacing hurriedly up and down the
room.Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from
her as an act of impertinence, Miss Perkins, having learned all the
company's cut-glass quotations by rote, could easily have supplied the
remainder of the letter.As it was, she waited impatiently, tapping the
corner of the desk with her idle pencil.Jimmy turned at the sound, and
glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval.After one or two more uneasy laps about the room, Jimmy went
to his 'phone and called his house number."It's undoubtedly domestic trouble," decided Miss Perkins, and she
wondered whether it would be delicate of her, under the circumstances,
to remain in the room.From her employer's conversation at the 'phone, it was clear to Miss
Perkins that Mrs.Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy,
but why this should have so annoyed MR.Jinks was a question that Miss
Perkins found it difficult to answer.Jinks's
present state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful
young wife of his friend?"Oh dear," thought Miss Perkins, "how
scandalous!""That will do," commanded Jimmy, interrupting Miss Perkins's interesting
speculations, and he nodded toward the door.Daniel moved to the bedroom."But----" stammered Miss Perkins, as she glanced at the unfinished
letters."I'll call you when I need you," answered Jimmy gruffly.Miss Perkins
left the room in high dudgeon."I'LL show them," said Jimmy to himself, determined to carry out his
recent resolve to be firm.Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles."Suppose, that Zoie,
after imposing secrecy upon him, should change that thing called her
'mind' and confide in Aggie about the luncheon?"He decided to telephone to Zoie's house and find out how affairs
were progressing."If Aggie HAS found out
about the luncheon," he argued, "my 'phoning to Zoie's will increase her
suspicions.If Zoie has told her nothing, she'll wonder why I'm 'phoning
to Zoie's house.There's only one thing to do," he decided.I can tell from Aggie's face when I meet her at dinner
whether Zoie has betrayed me."Having arrived at this conclusion, Jimmy resolved to get home as early
as possible, and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid.The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the day's remaining business
confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that
"the boss" had suddenly "gone off his head."And when he at last left
the office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of
relief from his usually tranquil staff.Instead of walking, as was his custom, Jimmy took a taxi to his home but
alas, to his surprise he found no wife."None at all," answered that unperturbed creature; and Jimmy felt sure
that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to
his household servants.When Jimmy's anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a woman's dress in
the hallway, his dinner had been waiting half an hour, and he had
worked himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and
everybody.At the sound of Aggie's voice however, his heart began to pound with
fear."Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he
was?Would she tell him that they were going to separate forever?""Awfully sorry to be so late,
dear," she said.Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his
neck.He decided forthwith to tell her everything, and never, never
again to run the risk of deceiving her; but before he could open his
lips, she continued gaily:

"I've brought Zoie home with me, dear.There's no sense in her eating
all alone, and she's going to have ALL her dinners with us.""After dinner," continued Aggie, "you and I can take her to
the theatre and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes
home."Was it possible that Alfred had already
relented?"Oh, he doesn't know it yet," explained Aggie, "but he's coming.We'll
tell you all about it at dinner."While waiting for Aggie, Jimmy had thought himself hungry, but once
the two women had laid before him their "nefarious baby-snatching
scheme"--food lost its savour for him, and one course after another was
taken away from him untouched.Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan,
as scheduled by them, he met the threatening eye of Zoie; and by the
time that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by
the chatter of the two excited women, that he was not only reconciled
but eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back, and
free him of the enforced companionship of Alfred's nerve-racking wife.True, he reflected, it was possible that Alfred, on his return, might
discover him to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out
his murderous threat; but even such a fate was certainly preferable to
interminable evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie."All YOU need do, Jimmy," explained Aggie sweetly, when the three of
them were comfortably settled in the library, "is to see your friend
the Superintendent of the Babies' Home, and tell him just what kind of a
baby we shall need, and when we shall need it.""Oh yes, indeed," said Aggie confidently, and she turned to Jimmy with
a matter-of-fact tone."You'd better tell the Superintendent to have
several for us to look at when the time arrives.""Yes, that's better," agreed Zoie.As for Jimmy, he had long ceased to make any audible comment, but
internally he was saying to himself: "man of strong mettle, indeed!""We'll attend to all the clothes for the child," said Aggie generously
to Jimmy."I want everything to be hand-made," exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically."We can make a great many of the things ourselves, evenings," said
Aggie, "while we sit here and talk to Jimmy."Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden."MOST evenings," assented Aggie."And then toward the last, you know,
Zoie----" she hesitated to explain further, for Jimmy was already
becoming visibly embarrassed."Oh, yes, that's true," blushed Zoie.There was an awkward pause, then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy, who
was pretending to rebuild the fire."Oh yes, one more thing," she said."When everything is quite ready for Alfred's return, we'll allow you,
Jimmy dear, to wire him the good news.""I wish it were time to wire now," said Zoie pensively, and in his mind,
Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment."The next few months will slip by before you know it," declared Aggie
cheerfully.John went to the office."And by the way, Zoie," she added, "why should you go back
to your lonesome flat to-night?"Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief--Jimmy sat up to receive
the next blow."Stay here with us," suggested Aggie."We'll be so glad
to have you."When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night, Jimmy remained
in his chair by the fire, too exhausted to even prepare for bed.This had certainly been the longest day of his life.CHAPTER XII

WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly
for Zoie, she was quite correct.They passed quickly for Aggie as well;
but how about Jimmy?When he afterward recalled this interval in his
life, it was always associated with long strands of lace winding around
the legs of the library chairs, white things lying about in all the
places where he had once enjoyed sitting or lying, late dinners, lonely
breakfasts, and a sense of isolation from Aggie.One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with
Aggie, he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been
helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion."It is all done in pink and white," explained Aggie, and then followed
detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens, the soft lovely hangings,
and even the entire relighting of the room.asked Jimmy, objecting to any scheme of Zoie's on general
principles."It's Alfred's favourite colour," explained Aggie."Besides, it's so
becoming," she added.Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfred's senses was
absolutely indecent, and he said so."Upon my word," answered Aggie, quite affronted, "you are getting as
unreasonable as Alfred himself."Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk, she
added coaxingly, "I was GOING to tell you about Zoie's lovely new
negligee, and about the dear little crib that just matches it."I can't think why you've taken such a dislike to that helpless child,"
said Aggie.A few days later, while in the midst of his morning's mail, Jimmy was
informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the
Babies' Home to select the last, but most important, detail for
their coming campaign.According to instructions, Jimmy had been in
communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home, and he now led
the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he, at least, had
attended properly to his part of the business.By the time they reached
the Children's Home, several babies were on view for their critical
inspection.Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee, red mites with
puckered faces.she exclaimed, "haven't you any white ones?""These are supposed to be white," said the Superintendent, with an
indulgent smile, "the black ones are on the other side of the room."cried Zoie in horror, and she faced about quickly as
though expecting an attack from their direction."Which particular one of these would you recommend?"asked the practical
Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot."Well, it's largely a matter of taste, ma'am," he answered."This seems
a healthy little chap," he added, and seizing the long white clothes
of the nearest infant, he drew him across his arm and held him out for
Aggie's inspection."Let's see," cried Zoie, and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the
Superintendent's elbow.As for Jimmy, he stood gloomily apart.This was an ordeal for which
he had long been preparing himself, and he was resolved to accept it
philosophically."I don't think much of that one," snipped Zoie."It's not MY affair," answered Jimmy curtly.Aggie perceived trouble brewing, and she turned to pacify Jimmy."Which
one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like?""If I were in his place----" began Jimmy hotly."Oh, but you AREN'T," interrupted Zoie; then she turned to the
Superintendent."What makes some of them so much larger than others?"she asked, glancing at the babies he had CALLED "white.""Well, you see they're of different ages," explained the Superintendent
indulgently.Jinks they must all be of the same age," said Zoie with a
reproachful look at Jimmy."I should say a week old," said Aggie."Then this is the one for you," decided the Superintendent, designating
his first choice."I think we'd better take the Superintendent's advice," said Aggie
complacently.Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air.Was it possible
that all babies were as homely as these?"You know, Zoie," explained Aggie, divining her thought, "they get
better looking as they grow older.""Fetch it home, Jimmy," said Aggie.exclaimed Jimmy, who had considered his mission completed."You don't expect US to carry it, do you?"The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
signed the necessary papers for its release."I thought all those details had been attended to," said Aggie, and
again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment."I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,"
volunteered the Superintendent."Very well," said Zoie, "and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
for it," and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi."Now," said Zoie, when they were properly seated, "let's stop at a
telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.""Wait until we get the baby," cautioned Aggie."We'll have it the first thing in the morning," argued Zoie."Jimmy can send him a night-letter," compromised Aggie, "that way Alfred
won't get the news until morning."A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and
with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.CHAPTER XIII

When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away
from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
ferment.Having settled this
point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper
and leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal
matters, by learning what was going on in the world at large.No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by
a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down
the aisle."Detroit," answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption."THAT'S a funny thing," declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
funny it really was."You know," he continued, so loud that everyone in
the vicinity could not fail to hear him, "the last time I met you two,
you were on your honeymoon--on THIS VERY TRAIN," and with that the
fellow sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a
long list of compliments about "the fine little girl" who had in his
opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to
a "dull, money-grubbing chap" like him."So," thought Alfred, "this is the way the world sees us."And he began
to frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself.Again he told
himself that he was right; but his friend's thoughtless words had
planted an uncomfortable doubt in his mind, and when he left the
train to drive to his hotel, he was thinking very little about the new
business relations upon which he was entering in Detroit, and very much
about the domestic relations which he had just severed in Chicago.Had he been merely a "dull money-grubber"?Had he left his wife too much
alone?Was she not a mere child when he married her?Could he not, with
more consideration, have made of her a more understanding companion?These were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he
arrived at one of Detroit's most enterprising hotels.But later, having telephoned to his office and found that several
matters of importance were awaiting his decision, he forced himself to
enter immediately upon his business obligations.As might have been expected, Alfred soon won the respect and serious
consideration of most of his new business associates, and this in a
measure so mollified his hurt pride, that upon rare occasions he was
affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes.But each
excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends, only
served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs.his hostess would remark before they were
fairly seated at table."They tell me she is so pretty," his vis-a-vis would exclaim.Then his host would laugh and tell the "dear ladies" that in HIS
opinion, Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit, lest he might
lose her to a handsomer man.Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him
almost to the point of declaring the whole truth.His LEAVING Zoie, and
his "losing" her, as these would-be comedians expressed it, were
two separate and distinct things in his mind, and he felt an almost
irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned.But no sooner did he open his lips to do so, than a picture of Zoie in
all her child-like pleading loveliness, arose to dissuade him.He could
imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him,
while they flayed poor Zoie alive.She would never have another chance
to be known as a respectable woman, and compared to most women of
his acquaintance, she WAS a respectable woman.True, according to
old-fashioned standards, she had been indiscreet, but apparently the
present day woman had a standard of her own.Alfred found his eye
wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends.Was there
one of them, he wondered, who had never fibbed to her husband, or eaten
a simple luncheon unchaperoned by him?Of one thing he was certain,
there was not one of them so attractive as Zoie.Might she not be
forgiven, to some extent, if her physical charms had made her a source
of dangerous temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with
whom she had no doubt lunched?Then, too, had she not offered at the
moment of his departure to tell him the "real truth"?Might this not
have been the one occasion upon which she would have done so?"She seemed
so sincere," he ruminated, "so truly penitent."Then again, how generous
it was of her to persist in writing to him with never an answer from
him to encourage her.If she cared for him so little as he had once
imagined, why should she wish to keep up even a presence of fondness?These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfred's mind
just three months after his departure from Chicago, and all the while
his hostess was mentally dubbing him a "dull person."she said before he was down the front
steps."It's hard to believe, isn't it?"commented a third, and his host
apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried
about a particular business decision that had to be made the next
morning.But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was
knotting Alfred's brow, as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel, where
he had told his office boy to leave the last mail.This had been
the longest interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing.He
recalled that her last letters had hinted at a "slight indisposition."In fact, she had even mentioned "seeing the doctor"--"Good Heavens!"he
thought, "Suppose she were really ill?When Alfred reached his rooms, the boy had not yet arrived.He crossed
to the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far
received from Zoie."How could he have been
so stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illness--whatever it
was--had been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of his
departure?"It contained no letter from Zoie and
Alfred went to bed with an uneasy mind.The next morning he was down at his office early, still no letter from
Zoie.Refusing his partner's invitation to lunch, Alfred sat alone in his
office, glad to be rid of intrusive eyes."He would write to Jimmy
Jinks," he decided, "and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate
danger."Not willing to await the return of his stenographer, or to acquaint her
with his personal affairs, Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat
helplessly before it.How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing
to invite a reconciliation with her?While he was trying to answer
this vexed question, a sharp knock came at the door.He turned to see a
uniformed messenger holding a telegram toward him.Intuitively he felt
that it contained some word about Zoie.John went back to the kitchen.His hand trembled so that he
could scarcely sign for the message before opening it.A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a
succession of contradictory exclamations.cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram.he shouted, excitedly, as he rose from his chair.he asked the astonished boy, and he began rummaging rapidly
through the drawers of his desk.And he thrust a bill into the small boy's
hand."Yes, sir," answered the boy and disappeared quickly, lest this madman
might reconsider his generosity.Alfred threw down the time table in despair."No train for Chicago until
night," he cried; but his mind was working fast.The next moment he was
at the telephone, asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway
line.When Alfred's partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note
informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would
"write."CHAPTER XIV

During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such
pleasurable emotions, Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink
and white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy.On
a rose-coloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons
through various bits of soft white linen, and in front of her, at the
foot of a rose-draped bed, knelt Zoie.She was trying the effect of
a large pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting
bassinette.she called to Aggie, as she turned her head to one side
and surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye.Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette."I wish you wouldn't
bother me every moment," she said."I'll never get all these things
finished."Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed, for she
applied herself to sewing it fast to the lining.In her excitement she
gave the thread a vicious pull."Oh, dear, oh dear, my thread is always
breaking!""Wouldn't YOU be excited," questioned Zoie'"if you were expecting a baby
and a husband in the morning?""I suppose I should," admitted Aggie.For a time the two friends sewed in silence, then Zoie looked up with
sudden anxiety."You're SURE Jimmy sent the wire?""I saw him write it," answered Aggie, "while I was in the office
to-day.""Oh, he won't GET it until to-morrow morning," said Aggie."I told you
that to-day."I wonder what he'll be doing when he gets it?"There was a
suspicion of a smile around her lips."What will he do AFTER he gets it?"Looking up at her friend in alarm, Zoie suddenly ceased sewing."You
don't mean he won't come?""Of course I don't," answered Aggie."He's only HUMAN if he is a
husband."There was a sceptical expression around Zoie's mouth, but she did not
pursue the subject."How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in
this pink basket?"And then with a regretful little sigh, she
declared that she wished she'd "used blue.""I didn't think the baby that we chose was so horribly red," said Aggie.cried Zoie, "it's magenta."she exclaimed in annoyance, and once more rethreaded her needle."I couldn't look at it," she continued with a disgusted little pucker of
her face."I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have
got used to it before Alfred gets here.""Now don't be silly," scolded Aggie."You know very well that the
Superintendent can't let it leave the home until its mother signs the
papers.It will be here the first thing in the morning.You'll have all
day to get used to it before Alfred gets here.""ALL DAY," echoed Zoie, and the corners of her mouth began to droop."Won't Alfred be here before TO-MORROW NIGHT?"Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoie's endless questions."I told
you," she explained wearily, "that the wire won't be delivered until
to-morrow morning, it will take Alfred eight hours to get here, and
there may not be a train just that minute.""Eight long hours," sighed Zoie dismally.And Aggie looked at her
reproachfully, forgetting that it is always the last hour that
is hardest to bear.Aggie was
meditating whether she should read her young friend a lecture on the
value of patience, when the telephone began to ring violently.Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown."You answer it, will you,
Aggie?""Hello," called Aggie sweetly over the 'phone; then she added in
surprise, "Is this you, Jimmy dear?"Apparently it was; and as Zoie
watched Aggie's face, with its increasing distress she surmised that
Jimmy's message was anything but "dear."cried Aggie over the telephone, "that's awful!"was the first question that burst from Zoie's
lips.Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet.echoed Zoie joyfully; and without waiting for more details
and with no thought beyond the moment, she flew to her dressing table
and began arranging her hair, powdering her face, perfuming her lips,
and making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husband's
return.Now the far-sighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at
the phone.Then she asked irritably, "Well,
didn't you mark it 'NIGHT message'?"From the expression on Aggie's face
it was evident that he had not done so."But, Jimmy," protested Aggie,
"this is dreadful!Then calling to him to wait a
minute, and leaving the receiver dangling, she crossed the room to
Zoie, who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet.she exclaimed excitedly, "Jimmy made a mistake.""Of course he'd do THAT," answered Zoie carelessly."But you don't understand," persisted Aggie."They sent the 'NIGHT
message' TO-DAY.cried Zoie, and the next instant she was
waltzing gaily about the room."That's all very well," answered Aggie, as she followed Zoie with
anxious eyes, "but WHERE'S YOUR BABY?"cried Zoie, and for the first time she became conscious
of their predicament.She gazed at Aggie in consternation."I forgot all
about it," she said, and then asked with growing anxiety, "What can we
DO?"echoed Aggie, scarcely knowing herself what answer to make, "we've
got to GET it--TO-NIGHT."But," protested Zoie, "how CAN we get it when the mother hasn't signed
the papers yet?""Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home,"
answered Aggie with decision, and she turned toward the 'phone to
instruct Jimmy accordingly."Yes, that's right," assented Zoie, glad to be rid of all further
responsibility, "we'll let Jimmy fix it.""Say, Jimmy," called Aggie excitedly, "you'll have to go straight to the
Children's Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can.There's
some red tape about the mother signing papers, but don't mind about
that.Make them give it to you to-night.There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire, for Aggie
added impatiently, "Go on, Jimmy, do!And with
that she hung up the receiver."Never mind about the clothes," answered Aggie."We're lucky if we get
the baby.""But I have to mind," persisted Zoie."I gave all its other things to
the laundress.And now the horrid
old creature hasn't brought them back yet.""You get into your OWN things," commanded Aggie.asked Zoie, her elation revived by the
thought of her fine raiment, and with that she flew to the foot of the
bed and snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from
Paris.she asked, as she held them both
aloft, "the pink or the blue?""It doesn't matter," answered Aggie wearily."Get into SOMETHING, that's
all.""Then unhook me," commanded Zoie gaily, as she turned her back to Aggie,
and continued to admire the two "creations" on her arm.So pleased was
she with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began
humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm."Stand still," commanded Aggie, but her warning was unnecessary, for at
that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear."Suppose," she said in alarm, "that Jimmy can't GET the baby?""He's GOT to get it," answered Aggie emphatically, and she undid the
last stubborn hook of Zoie's gown and put the girl from her.Mary travelled to the office."There,
now, you're all unfastened," she said, "hurry and get dressed.""You mean undressed," laughed Zoie, as she let her pretty evening gown
fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee.she exclaimed, as she caught sight of her reflection in the
mirror, "isn't it a love?"Alfred just adores
pink."answered Aggie, but in spite of herself, she was quite thrilled
by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her.Zoie had
certainly never looked more irresistible."Can't you get some of that
colour out of your cheeks," asked Aggie in despair."I'll put on some cold cream and powder," answered Zoie.She flew to her
dressing table; and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate
vicinity.She turned to Aggie to inquire the result."It couldn't be Alfred, could it?"asked Zoie with mingled hope and
dread."Of course not," answered Aggie, as she removed the receiver from the
hook."Alfred wouldn't 'phone, he would come right up."CHAPTER XV

Discovering that it was merely Jimmy "on the wire," Zoie's uneasiness
abated, but Aggie's anxiety was visibly increasing.she
repeated, then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were
apparently not satisfactory.cried his disturbed wife, "it
can't be!shrieked Zoie, trying to get her small ear close enough to
the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message."Wait a minute," called Aggie into the 'phone.Then she turned to Zoie
with a look of despair."The mother's changed her mind," she explained;
"she won't give up the baby."cried Zoie, and she sank into the nearest chair.For an
instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces."What can
we DO," asked Zoie.This was indeed a serious predicament;
but presently Zoie saw her friend's mouth becoming very resolute, and
she surmised that Aggie had solved the problem."We'll have to get
ANOTHER baby, that's all," decided Aggie."There, in the Children's Home," answered Aggie with great confidence,
and she returned to the 'phone.Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little
pink slippers."Oh, Aggie," she sighed, "the others were all so red!""Listen, Jimmy," she called in the
'phone, "can't you get another baby?"There was a pause, then Aggie
commanded hotly, "Well, GET in the business!"Another pause and then
Aggie continued very firmly, "Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST
have one."Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a
reminder to Aggie."Tell him to get a HE one," she said, "Alfred wants a
boy."answered Aggie impatiently, and again she gave
her attention to the 'phone.she cried, with growing despair,
and Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now."Nothing under three
months," explained Aggie."A three-months' old baby is as big as a
whale.""Well, can't we say it GREW UP?"asked Zoie, priding herself on her
power of ready resource.Almost vanquished by her friend's new air of cold superiority, Zoie
was now on the verge of tears."Somebody must have a new baby," she
faltered."For their own personal USE, yes," admitted Aggie, "but who has a new
baby for US?""You're the one who ought to
know.You got me into this, and you've GOT to get me out of it.Can you
imagine," she asked, growing more and more unhappy, "what would happen
to me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby?He wouldn't
forgive a LITTLE lie, what would he do with a WHOPPER like this?"Then
with sudden decision, she rushed toward the 'phone."Let me talk to
Jimmy," she said, and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and
incoherently over the 'phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word
that she said, and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of
action."Say, Jimmy," stammered Zoie into the 'phone, "you've GOT to get me a
baby.If you don't, I'll kill myself!You got me
into this, Jimmy," she reminded him."You've GOT to get me out of it."And then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings, and at length,
a pause, during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so.she shrieked, tiptoeing
to get her lips closer to the receiver; then she added with conviction,
"the mother has no business to change her mind."Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the
less."Well, take it away from her," commanded Zoie."Get it quick, while she
isn't looking."Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make
sure that Aggie was still out of the room, she indulged in a few dark
threats to Jimmy, also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her
into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the
misfortunes that had ever befallen her.Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of ear-shot of Zoie's
conversation, the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely--as
it was--the result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the time
that Aggie returned to the room, Zoie was wreathed in smiles."It's all right," she said sweetly."Goodness knows I hope so," she said,
then added in despair, "Look at your cheeks.Once more the powder puff was called into requisition, and Zoie turned a
temporarily blanched face to Aggie."Very much," answered Aggie, "but how about your hair?"Her reflection betrayed a
coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy."Would anybody think you'd been in bed for days?""Alfred likes it that way," was Zoie's defence."Turn around," said Aggie, without deigning to argue the matter further.And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted
curls.exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and
arms with her favourite perfume.Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with
the tips of her perfumed fingers."Good gracious," she cried in horror
as she caught sight of her reflection."You're not going to put my hair
in a pigtail!""That's the way invalids always have their hair," was Aggie's laconic
reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls.declared Zoie, and she shook herself free
from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful
pigtail."If you're going to make a perfect fright of me," pouted Zoie, "I just
won't see him.""He isn't coming to see YOU," reminded Aggie."He's coming to see the
baby.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby," answered Zoie."Get into bed," said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace
coverlets.Her eyes caught the small knot of
lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of
her saucy little curls."In you go," said Aggie, motioning to the bed."Wait," said Zoie impressively, "wait till I get my rose lights on the
pillow."She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly
the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow--she studied
the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two
more formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed.One more
glance at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to
fall "carelessly" outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above
her head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her
pillows.Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table
with a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third
coating of powder.Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze."Aggie," she said, "I just
hate you when you act like that."But suddenly she was seized with a new
idea."I wonder," she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink
sofa bathed in firelight, "I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that
couch under those roses."Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary."Then," decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, "I'll get Alfred to carry
me to the couch.That way I can get my arms around his neck.And once
you get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him."Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval."Now,
don't you make too much fuss over Alfred," she continued."YOU'RE the
one who's to do the forgiving.What's more," she
reminded Zoie, "you're very, very weak."But before she had time to
instruct Zoie further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door.The two women glanced at each other inquiringly.The next instant a
man's step was heard in the hallway.demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety."Lie down," commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back
limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the
room.CHAPTER XVI

When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment.It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber.Through the dim rose
light he could barely perceive his young wife.She was lying white and
apparently lifeless on her pillows.He moved cautiously toward the bed,
but Aggie raised a warning finger.Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's
hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie,
whose eyes were closed.He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and
reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the
bed.To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's
fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace."Alfred,
Alfred!"cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses.As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught
the reproving eye of Aggie.With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her
tenacious hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back,
apparently exhausted, upon her pillows."It's been too much for her," said the terrified young husband, and he
glanced toward Aggie in anxiety."How pale she looks," added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the
pillows."She's so weak, poor dear," sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper.Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie.It was then that his attention
was for the first time attracted toward the crib.Daniel journeyed to the office.And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and
sat straight up in bed.He was making
determinedly for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of
possession.Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the
empty bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women.Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came.Alfred's eyes turned to Aggie.The look on her face increased his worst
fears."Don't tell me he's----" he could not bring himself to utter the
word.He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other.Aggie also made an unsuccessful
attempt to speak.Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the
situation, Zoie declared boldly: "He's out.""With Jimmy," explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she
knew how."Just for a breath of air," explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely
regained her self-possession."Isn't he very young to be out at night?"asked Alfred with a puzzled
frown."We told Jimmy that," answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness
with which each succeeding lie presented itself."But you see," she
continued, "Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything
with him.""He always
said babies were 'little red worms.'""Not this one," answered Zoie sweetly."No, indeed," chimed in Aggie."I'll soon put a stop to that,"
he declared.Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie
stammered evasively."Oh, j-just downstairs--somewhere.""I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere," decided Alfred, and he snatched
up his hat and started toward the door.Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a
frantic embrace."I'll be back in a minute, dear," he said, but Zoie
clung to him and pleaded desperately."You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?"He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of
Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not
to be borne."Now, dearie," she said, "I
wish you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit.I don't wish baby to see you
looking so horrid.""Yes, do, Alfred," insisted Aggie."He's sure to be here in a minute.""My boy won't care HOW his father looks," declared Alfred proudly, and
Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three
inches."But _I_ care," persisted Zoie."Now, Zoie," cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with
affected solicitude.Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and
again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint.Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman
thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair
the injury.Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed."Let her have her own way," she whispered with a significant glance
toward Zoie.Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify
that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to
the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead."There now, dear," he whispered, "lie still and rest and I'll go shave
and wash up a bit.""Mind," he whispered to Aggie, "you are to call me the moment my boy
comes," and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom.No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and
called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, "What's keeping them?""I can't imagine," answered Aggie, also in whisper."If I had Jimmy here," declared Zoie vindictively, "I'd wring his little
fat neck," and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers,
she was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's
bedroom door, gave her a warning signal.Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred
re-entered the room in search of his satchel.Aggie found it for him
quickly.Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes."I'm so sorry," he
apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room.Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation."Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby," whispered Zoie."In that case, he'd have 'phoned," argued Aggie."Let's 'phone to the Home," suggested Zoie, "and find----" She was
interrupted by Alfred's voice."Say, Aggie," called Alfred from the next room.answered Aggie sweetly, and she crossed to the door and waited."Not yet, Alfred," said Aggie, and she closed the door very softly, lest
Alfred should hear her."I never knew Alfred could be so silly!"warned Aggie, and she glanced anxiously toward Alfred's door."He doesn't care a bit about me!""It's all that horrid
old baby that he's never seen.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, he never WILL see it," declared Aggie, and
she started toward the window to look out.Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell.The two women
glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear.Then their eyes sought
the door expectantly.CHAPTER XVII

With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby
hat pulled low, Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room.When he at
length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop, Aggie
perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly
buttoned coat."Give it to me," demanded Aggie.Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied, then glanced uneasily over his
shoulder, to make sure that no one was pursuing him.Aggie unbuttoned
his ulster, seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl, and clasped it
to her bosom with a sigh of relief.she exclaimed, then
crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge.In the meantime, having thrown discretion to the wind, Zoie had hopped
out of bed.As usual, her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a
reproach."Yes," chimed in Aggie, who was now bending over the crib.answered Jimmy hotly, "if you two think you can do any
better, you're welcome to the job," and with that he threw off his
overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch.exclaimed Zoie and Aggie, simultaneously, and they glanced
nervously toward Alfred's bedroom door.Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should "sh."Instead, Zoie turned her back upon him."Let's see it," she said, peeping into the bassinette.And then with a
little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully.Jimmy's contempt for woman's ingratitude was too
deep for words, and he only stared at her in injured silence.But his
reflections were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room, to
inquire again about Baby.whispered Jimmy, beginning to realise the meaning of
the women's mysterious behaviour.said Aggie again to Jimmy, and Zoie flew toward the bed,
almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the
covers.For the present Alfred did not disturb them further.Apparently he was
still occupied with his shaving, but just as Jimmy was about to ask for
particulars, the 'phone rang.The three culprits glanced guiltily at
each other.whispered Zoie in a frightened voice.Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the
'phone."But we can't," she was
saying; "that's impossible."called Zoie across the foot of the bed, unable longer to
endure the suspense."How dare you call my husband a
thief!""Wait a minute," said Aggie, then she left the receiver hanging by the
cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her."It's the Children's
Home," she explained."That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby!"exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmy's part were
unthinkable.Then she looked at him accusingly, and asked in low,
measured tones, "DID you STEAL HER BABY, JIMMY?""How else COULD I steal a baby?"Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him,
and Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice."Well, the Superintendent says you've got to bring it straight back.""He sha'n't bring it back," declared Zoie.asked Aggie, "he's holding the
wire.""Tell him he can't have it," answered Zoie, as though that were the end
of the whole matter."Well," concluded Aggie, "he says if Jimmy DOESN'T bring it back the
mother's coming after it."As for Jimmy, he bolted for the door.Aggie caught him by the sleeve as
he passed."Wait, Jimmy," she said peremptorily.There was a moment of
awful indecision, then something approaching an idea came to Zoie."Tell the Superintendent that it isn't here," she whispered to Aggie
across the footboard."Tell him that Jimmy hasn't got here yet.""Yes," agreed Jimmy, "tell him I haven't got here yet."Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the 'phone."Hello," she called
pleasantly; then proceeded to explain.There was a pause, then she added in her most conciliatory tone, "I'll
tell him what you say when he comes in."Another pause, and she hung up
the receiver with a most gracious good-bye and turned to the others with
increasing misgivings."He says he won't be responsible for that mother
much longer--she's half-crazy.""Well," decided Aggie after careful deliberation, "you'd better take it
back, Jimmy, before Alfred sees it."And again Jimmy bolted, but again he
failed to reach the door.CHAPTER XVIII

His face covered with lather, and a shaving brush in one hand, Alfred
entered the room just as his friend was about to escape.exclaimed the excited young father, "you're back.""Oh, yes--yes," admitted Jimmy nervously, "I'm back."cried Alfred, and he glanced toward the crib."Yes--yes," agreed Aggie uneasily, as she tried to place herself between
Alfred and the bassinette."He's here, but you mayn't have him, Alfred."exclaimed Alfred, trying to put her out of the way."Not yet," protested Aggie, "not just yet.""Give him to me," demanded Alfred, and thrusting Aggie aside, he took
possession of the small mite in the cradle."But--but, Alfred," pleaded Aggie, "your face.He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy.Lifting the baby in his arms he circled
the room cooing to him delightedly."Was he away from home when his fadder came?Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous
treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed
toward Zoie with an overflowing heart.he exclaimed, and
he covered her cheek with kisses.cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and
brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check.But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation, and again he circled
the room, making strange gurgling sounds to Baby."Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder?"he said
sympathetically, in the small person's ear; and he glanced at Jimmy with
frowning disapproval."I'd just like to see him get you away from me
again!"he added to Baby, as he tickled the mite's ear with the end of
his shaving brush.he exclaimed in trepidation, as he
perceived a bit of lather on the infant's cheek.Then lifting the boy
high in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride, he looked
at Jimmy with an air of superiority."I guess I'm bad, aye?"As for Zoie, she was growing more and more
impatient for a little attention to herself."Rock-a-bye, Baby," sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child
high in his arms.Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised.They kept time to
his lullaby out of sheer nervousness.Suddenly Alfred stopped, held the
child from him and gazed at it in horror."Look at that baby's face," commanded
Alfred.Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances, then Zoie asked in
trepidation, "What's the matter with his face?""He's got a fever," declared Alfred.And he started toward the bed to
show the child to its mother.shrieked Zoie, waving Alfred off in wild alarm.asked Alfred, backing from her in surprise.Aggie crossed quickly to Alfred's side and looked over his shoulder at
the boy."I don't see anything wrong with its face," she said."Oh," said Jimmy with a superior air, "they're always like that.""Nothing of the sort," snorted Alfred, and he glared at Jimmy
threateningly."You've frozen the child parading him around the
streets.""Let me have him, Alfred," begged Aggie sweetly; "I'll put him in his
crib and keep him warm."His eyes followed him to the crib
with anxiety.he asked, as he glanced first from
one to the other.Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired
person to drop from the ceiling.Then Zoie turned upon her unwary
accomplice."Jimmy," she called in a threatening tone, "where IS his nurse?""Does Jimmy take the nurse out, too?"demanded Alfred, more and more
annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his
absence.John went to the hallway."Never mind about the nurse," interposed Aggie.I'll tuck him in," and she bent fondly over the crib, but Alfred
was not to be so easily pacified."Do you mean to tell me," he exclaimed excitedly, "that my boy hasn't
any nurse?""We HAD a nurse," corrected Zoie, "but--but I had to discharge her."Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation."She was crazy," stammered Zoie.Alfred's eyes sought Aggie's for confirmation.The latter jerked his head up and down in
nervous assent."Well," said Alfred, amazed at their apparent lack of resource, "why
didn't you get ANOTHER nurse?""Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby to-night," declared Zoie,
and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how."Yes, indeed," answered Aggie, studiously avoiding Jimmy's eye."Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy," said
Zoie.exclaimed Jimmy, too desperate to care what Alfred might infer.Ignoring Jimmy's implied protest, Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred:

"Now, don't worry, dear; go back to your room and finish your shaving."Then his hand went
mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment.he exclaimed, "I had forgotten all about it.That shows you how
excited I am."And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle, he went
quickly from the room, singing a high-pitched lullaby.Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation,
Alfred returned to the room.It was apparent that there was something
important on his mind."By the way," he said, glancing from one to another, "I forgot to
ask--what's his name?"The conspirators looked at each other without answering.Of course his son had been given his father's name,
but he wished to HEAR someone say so."Baby's, I mean," he explained impatiently.Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoie's eyes were upon him.called Zoie, meaning only to appeal to him for a name.After waiting in vain for any response, Alfred advanced upon the
uncomfortable Jimmy."You seem to be very popular around here," he sneered.Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the
pattern of the rug upon which he was standing.After what seemed an age to Jimmy, Alfred turned his back upon his old
friend and started toward his bedroom.Jimmy peeped out uneasily from
his long eyelashes.When Alfred reached the threshold, he faced about
quickly and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation.It seemed to Jimmy
that Alfred's nostrils were dilating.He would not have been surprised
to see Alfred snort fire.He let his eyes fall before the awful
spectacle of his friend's wrath.Alfred's upper lip began to curl.He
cast a last withering look in Jimmy's direction, retired quickly from
the scene and banged the door.John went to the bathroom.When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by
the contemptuous gaze of Zoie, who was sitting up in bed and regarding
him with undisguised disapproval."Why didn't you tell him what the baby's name is?""How do _I_ know what the baby's name is?"cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door
through which Alfred had just passed."What does it matter WHAT the baby's name is so long as we have to send
it back?""I'll NOT send it back," declared Zoie emphatically, "at least not until
morning.That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one.""See here, you two can't be changing babies
every five minutes without Alfred knowing it."You know perfectly well that all
young babies look just alike.Their own mothers couldn't tell them
apart, if it weren't for their clothes."Before Aggie could answer, Alfred was again heard calling from the next
room.Apparently all his anger had subsided, for he inquired in the most
amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling.Aggie crossed quickly to the door, and sweetly reassured the anxious
father, then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy
with a new inspiration lighting her face."I have it," she exclaimed
ecstatically."Now see here," he objected, "every time YOU 'HAVE IT,' I DO IT.The
NEXT time you 'HAVE IT' YOU DO IT!"The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved
consideration, but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both
women.Hopping quickly out of bed, without even glancing in his
direction, Zoie gave her entire attention to Aggie."There must be OTHER babies' Homes," said Aggie, and she glanced at
Jimmy from her superior height."They aren't open all night like corner drug stores," growled Jimmy."Well, they ought to be," decided Zoie."And surely," argued Aggie, "in an extraordinary case--like----"

"This was an 'extraordinary case,'" declared Jimmy, "and you saw what
happened this time, and the Superintendent is a friend of mine--at least
he WAS a friend of mine."And with that Jimmy sat himself down on the
far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that
these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life.Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust; her friend Aggie had made an
excellent suggestion, and instead of acting upon it with alacrity, here
sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child."I suppose," said Zoie, as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle, "there
are SOME babies in the world outside of Children's Homes.""Of course," was Aggie's enthusiastic rejoinder; "there's one born every
minute.""But I was born BETWEEN minutes," protested Jimmy.Again Aggie exclaimed that she "had it.""She's got it twice as bad," groaned Jimmy, and he wondered what new
form her persecution of him was about to take."We can't advertise NOW," protested Zoie.answered Aggie, as she snatched the paper quickly from
the table and began running her eyes up and down its third page."Married--married," she murmured, and then with delight she found
the half column for which she was searching."Born," she exclaimed
triumphantly.Get a pencil, Zoie, and we'll take down all
the new ones.""Of course," agreed Zoie, clapping her hands in glee, "and Jimmy can get
a taxi and look them right up."shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists."Now you
two, see here----"

Before Jimmy could complete his threat, there was a sharp ring of the
door bell.He looked at the two women inquiringly."It's the mother," cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper.repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from
one door to the other.called Zoie, and drawing Jimmy's overcoat quickly
from his arm, Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle.For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room,
hatless, coatless, and shorn of ideas.A loud knock on the door decided
him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair, just
as Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover
over her head.The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it.CHAPTER XIX

From his hiding-place Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and
saw what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room.Closer
inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie, the washerwoman's
daughter, propelling the basket, which was piled high with freshly
laundered clothing.Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief, and unknotted his
cramped limbs."Shall I lay the things on the sofa, mum?"asked Maggie as she placed
her basket on the floor and waited for Zoie's instructions."Yes, please," answered Zoie, too exhausted for further comment.Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket, Maggie made excuses
for its delay, while she placed it on the couch.Deaf to Maggie's
chatter, Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows; but she soon heard
something that lifted her straight up in bed."Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin' this week," said Maggie
over her shoulder; "but we've got twins at OUR house."Then together they stared
at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world.Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself, Jimmy had begun to
rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that
his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady, determined gaze.In spite of himself, Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs.Now, Jimmy had heard Maggie's announcement about the bountiful supply
of offspring lately arrived at her house, but not until he caught the
fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the
part they meant him to play in their next adventure.He waited for no
explanation--he bolted toward the door.But it was not until she had laid firm
hold of him that he waited.Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she
considered her superiors, Maggie looked first at Aggie, then at Jimmy,
then at Zoie, uncertain whether to go or to stay."Anythin' to go back, mum?"Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed."Maggie," she asked in a deep, sepulchral tone, "where do you live?""Just around the corner on High Street, mum," gasped Maggie.Then,
keeping her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and
backed cautiously toward the door.commanded Zoie; and Maggie paused, one foot in mid-air."Wait in
the hall," said Zoie."Yes'um," assented Maggie, almost in a whisper.Then she nodded her
head jerkily, cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were
regarding her so strangely, and slipped quickly through the door.Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door, Aggie returned
to Jimmy, who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped
animal."It's Providence," she declared, with a grave countenance.Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence, then rolled his round
eyes away from her.He was confronted by Zoie, who had approached from
the opposite side of the room."It's Fate," declared Zoie, in awe-struck tones.Jimmy was beginning to wriggle, but he kept up a last desperate presence
of not understanding them."You needn't tell me I'm going to take the wash to the old lady," he
said, "for I'm not going to do it.""It isn't the WASH," said Aggie, and her tone warned him that she
expected no nonsense from him."You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do," said Zoie."I'll write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of
those babies right now."And with that she turned toward her desk and
began rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad."The luck of
these poor," she murmured."The luck of US," corrected Aggie, whose spirits were now soaring.Then
she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm."Just think of it, dear,"
she said, "Fate has sent us a baby to our very door.""Well," declared Jimmy, again beginning to show signs of fight, "if
Fate has sent a baby to the door, you don't need me," and with that he
snatched his coat from the crib."Wait, Jimmy," again commanded Aggie, and she took his coat gently but
firmly from him."Now, see here," argued Jimmy, trying to get free from his strong-minded
spouse, "you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isn't going to
let us have that baby.""Nonsense," called Zoie over her shoulder, while she scribbled a hurried
note to the washerwoman."If she won't let us have it 'for keeps,' I'll
just'rent it.'""Warm, fresh,
palpitating babies rented as you would rent a gas stove!""That's all a pose," declared Aggie, in a matter-of-fact tone."You
think babies 'little red worms,' you've said so.""She'll be only too glad to rent it," declared Zoie, as she glanced
hurriedly through the note just written, and slipped it, together with
a bill, into an envelope.It's only until I can
get another one."shouted Jimmy, and his eyes turned heavenward for help."An
endless chain with me to put the links together!""Don't be so theatrical," said Aggie, irritably, as she took up Jimmy's
coat and prepared to get him into it."Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING," sighed Zoie.echoed Jimmy, and he looked at her with wondering eyes."I crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their
mother's breasts, and you call THAT nothing?""You don't have to 'CRAWL,'" reminded Zoie, "you can take a taxi.""Here's your coat, dear," said Aggie graciously, as she endeavoured to
slip Jimmy's limp arms into the sleeves of the garment."You can take Maggie with you," said Zoie, with the air of conferring a
distinct favour upon him."And the wash on my lap," added Jimmy sarcastically."No," said Zoie, unruffled by Jimmy's ungracious behaviour."That's very kind of you," sneered Jimmy, as he unconsciously allowed
his arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him."All you need to do," said Aggie complacently, "is to get us the baby.""Yes," said Jimmy, "and what do you suppose my friends would say if they
were to see me riding around town with the wash-lady's daughter and a
baby on my lap?he asked Aggie, "if you didn't know
the facts?""Nobody's going to see you," answered Aggie impatiently; "it's only
around the corner.Go on, Jimmy, be a good boy.""You mean a good thing," retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot.exclaimed Zoie; "it's as easy as can be.""Yes, the FIRST one SOUNDED easy, too," said Jimmy."All you have to do," explained Zoie, trying to restrain her rising
intolerance of his stupidity, "is to give this note to Maggie's mother.She'll give you her baby, you bring it back here, we'll give you THIS
one, and you can take it right back to the Home.""And meet the other mother," concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head.There was a distinct threat in Zoie's voice when she again addressed the
stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes."You'd better meet here THERE than HERE," she warned him; "you know what
the Superintendent said.""That's true," agreed Aggie with an anxious face."Come now," she
pleaded, "it will only take a minute; you can do the whole thing before
you have had time to think.""Before I have had time to think," repeated Jimmy excitedly."That's how
you get me to do everything.Well, this time I've HAD time to think and
I don't think I will!"and with that he threw himself upon the couch,
unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes."You haven't time to sit down," said Aggie."I'll TAKE time," declared Jimmy.His eyes blinked ominously and he
remained glued to the couch.There was a short silence; the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair.Remembering a fresh grievance, Jimmy turned upon them."By the way," he said, "do you two know that I haven't had anything to
eat yet?""And do you know," said Zoie, "that Alfred may be back at any minute?"Not unless he has cut his throat," rejoined Jimmy, "and that's what I'd
do if I had a razor."Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption."Can't you ever
think of anybody but yourself?"she asked, with a martyred air.Had Jimmy been half his age, Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him
make a face at her friend for answer.As it was, she resolved to make
one last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of
duty."You see, dear," she said, "you might better get the washerwoman's baby
than to go from house to house for one," and she glanced again toward
the paper."Yes," urged Zoie, "and that's just what you'll HAVE to do, if you don't
get this one."It was apparent that his courage was
slipping from him.Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity, and
before Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles, she had
slipped one arm coyly about his neck."Now, Jimmy," she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing
temple, and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead, "wont
you do this little teeny-weepy thing just for me?"Jimmy's lips puckered in a pout; he began to blink nervously.Aggie
slipped her other arm about his neck."You know," she continued with a baby whine, "I got Zoie into this, and
I've just got to get her out of it.You're not going to desert me,
are you, Jimmy?You WILL help me, won't you, dear?"Her breath was on
Jimmy's cheek; he could feel her lips stealing closer to his.He had not
been treated to much affection of late.His head drooped lower--he began
to twiddle the fob on his watch chain.she repeated, and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip
of his retrousee nose.Jimmy's head was now wagging from side to side.she entreated a fourth time, and she kissed him full on the
lips.With a resigned sigh, Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed
laundry and held out his fat chubby hand."Give me the letter," he groaned."Here you are," said Zoie, taking Jimmy's acquiescence as a matter of
course; and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmy's ulster."Now, when you get back with the baby," she continued, "don't come in
all of a sudden; just wait outside and whistle.You CAN WHISTLE, can't
you?"For answer, Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a
shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward
Alfred's bedroom door."Yes, you can WHISTLE," admitted Zoie, then she continued her
directions."If Alfred is not in the room, I'll raise the shade and you
can come right up."asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm."If he IS in the room," explained Zoie, "you must wait outside until I
can get rid of him."Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she
still approved of Zoie's inhuman plan.For answer Aggie stroked his coat
collar fondly."We'll give you the signal the moment the coast is clear," she said,
then she hurriedly buttoned Jimmy's large ulster and wound a muffler
about his neck."There now, dear, do go, you're all buttoned up," and
with that she urged him toward the door."Just a minute," protested Jimmy, as he paused on the threshold."Let me
get this right, if the shade is up, I stay down.""Not at all," corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath."If the shade is up,
you come up."Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoie's direction.he said, "you know it is only twenty-three
below zero and I haven't had anything to eat yet--and----"

"Yes, we know," interrupted the two women in chorus, and then Aggie
added wearily, "go on, Jimmy; don't be funny.""With a baby on my lap and the wash lady's
daughter, I won't be funny, oh no!"It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another
state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by
thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him.After this act of heroic decision on her part, the two women listened
intently, fearing that he might return; but presently they heard the
bang of the outer door, and at last they drew a long breath of relief.For the first time since Alfred's arrival, Aggie was preparing to sink
into a chair, when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie."Good heavens," cried Zoie, "I forgot to ask Maggie.""Boys or girls," said Zoie, with a solemn look toward the door through
which Jimmy had just disappeared."Well," decided Aggie, after a moment's reflection, "it's too late now.Anyway," she concluded philosophically, "we couldn't CHANGE it."CHAPTER XX

With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement, Alfred
completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe.Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room
expostulating with Aggie, the young man stopped dumbfounded on the
threshold."Zoie," he cried in astonishment.For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied."Why, I--I----" Her eyes sought Aggie's for a suggestion; there was no
answer there.It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle that she
was seized by the desired inspiration."I just got up to see baby," she faltered, then putting one hand giddily
to her head, she pretended to sway.In an instant Alfred's arms were about her."You stay here, my darling," he said tenderly."I'll bring baby
to you," and after a solicitous caress he turned toward baby's crib and
bent fondly over the little one."Ah, there's father's man," he said.Oh, goodis g'acious," then followed an incoherent
muttering of baby talk, as he bore the youngster toward Zoie's bed."Come, my precious," he called to Zoie, as he sank down on the edge of
the bed.It had suddenly dawned upon her that
this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest
of her life.But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoie's face."What a funny face," he cooed as he pinched the youngster's cheek."Great Scott, what a grip," he cried as the infant's fingers closed
around his own."Will you look at the size of those hands," he
exclaimed.Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances; the baby had no doubt
inherited his large hands from his mother."Say, Aggie," called Alfred, "what are all of these little specks
on baby's forehead?""One, two,
three," he counted.Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of
the little stranger."Oh," said Aggie, with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfred's
shoulder and glanced at baby's forehead.exclaimed Alfred excitedly, "that's dangerous, isn't it?And he rose and started hurriedly toward the
telephone, baby in arms."Don't be silly," called Zoie, filled with vague alarm at the thought of
the family physician's appearance and the explanations that this might
entail.Stepping between Alfred and the 'phone, Aggie protested frantically."You see, Alfred," she said, "it is better to have the rash OUT, it
won't do any harm unless it turns IN.""He's perfectly well," declared Zoie, "if you'll only put him in his
crib and leave him alone."he asked, and he
tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs."I'll tell you what,"
he called over his shoulder to Zoie, "he's a fine looking boy."And then
with a mysterious air, he nodded to Aggie to approach.Aggie glanced at her, uncertain what
answer to make."I--I hadn't thought," she stammered weakly."Go on, go on," exclaimed the proud young father, "you can't tell me
that you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance.""Why," said Alfred, "he's the image of Zoie."Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfred's arms.she
shrieked in disgust, then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace
coverlet over her face.Mistaking Zoie's feeling for one of embarrassment at being over-praised,
Alfred bore the infant to her bedside."See, dear," he persisted, "see
for yourself, look at his forehead.""I'd rather look at you," pouted Zoie, peeping from beneath the
coverlet, "if you would only put that thing down for a minute."exclaimed Alfred, as though doubting his own ears.But before
he could remonstrate further, Zoie's arms were about his neck and she
was pleading jealously for his attention."Please, Alfred," she begged, "I
