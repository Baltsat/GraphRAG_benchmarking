Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.John went back to the bathroom.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Sandra went to the bathroom.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!When the notion of hereditary right
had once established itself, the formal creation of peerages by patent
was a natural stage.Looking at the matter from this historical point
of view, it seems to me simply wonderful how any one can doubt the
power of the Crown to create life-peerages, or to regulate the tenure
or succession of a peerage in any way that it thinks good.The House of Lords then, I do not hesitate to say, represents, or
rather is, the ancient Witenagemót.An assembly in which at first every
freeman had a right to appear has, by the force of circumstances, step
by step, without any one moment of sudden change, shrunk up into an
Assembly wholly hereditary and official, an Assembly to which the Crown
may summon any man, but to which, it is now strangely held, the Crown
cannot refuse to summon the representatives of any man whom it has
once summoned.As in most other things, the tendency to shrink up into
a body of this kind began to show itself before the Norman Conquest,
and was finally confirmed and established through the results of the
Norman Conquest.But the special function of the body into which the
old national Assembly has changed, the function of “another House,” an
Upper House, a House of Lords as opposed to a House of Commons, could
not show itself till a second House of a more popular constitution
had arisen by its side.Like everything else in our English polity,
both Houses in some sort came of themselves.Neither of them was the
creation of any ingenious theorist, though we need not doubt that many
of the several steps in the growth of each were, each in its own time,
the work of practical statesmanship.Our forefathers had no theories;
but men, each in his own generation, had eyes keen enough to see that
such and such a change in detail would get rid of such and such an
immediate evil, or would bring with it such and such an immediate
advantage.Nay more, it has sometimes happened that a change which
was brought in with an evil intent has in the end worked for good.Measures which were taken with a view of strengthening the power of
the Crown have come in the end to widen the rights of the people.On
the other hand, institutions which once answered a good and needful
purpose have sometimes, through change of times, changed their nature
and have become instruments of evil instead of good.But in neither
case were the institutions of our fathers the work of abstract theory.They have therefore lived on, and they have borne good fruit.Our
national Assembly has changed its name and its constitution, but
its corporate identity has lived on unbroken.We can therefore at
any moment reform without destroying.In France, on the other hand,
institutions have been the work of abstract theory; they have been the
creations, for good or for evil, of the minds of individual men.The
English Parliament is immemorial; it grew step by step out of the older
order of things.In France the older order of things utterly vanished;
the ground lay open for the creation of a wholly new institution, and
the States-General were called into being at the bidding of Philip the
Fair(11).Englishmen in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had no
theories of the rights of man or of universal humanity.But when they
saw a practical grievance, they called for its redress.Frenchmen in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had theories as magnificent as
any that have been put forth in the eighteenth or the nineteenth.And
they had even then already learned to do deeds of blood in the name
of freedom and philanthropy(12).The States-General lived but a fitful life from century
to century, and they perished for ever in the Great Revolution.Since
that time no French institution, no form either of the legislative or
of the executive power, has been able to keep up a continuous being of
twenty years.This difference has not been owing to any lack of great
men or of noble purposes on the part of our continental neighbours.It
has been owing, partly, we may believe, to differences in the inborn
character of the two nations, partly to differences in the course
taken by their several histories.In France the Kings gradually swept
away all traces of older free institutions, and established a simple
despotism in the Crown(13).The French therefore have been left
without any traditional foundation to build on.In all their changes
for good or for evil they have been driven to build afresh from the
beginning.Our Kings never wholly wiped out our free institutions;
they found means to turn them to their own purposes, and to establish
a practical despotism without destroying the outward forms of freedom.The forms thus lived on, and in better times they could again be
clothed with their substance.We ever had traditional principles to
fall back upon, a traditional basis to build upon.It would be hard to
reckon up the number of Assemblies, Conventions, Chambers of Deputies,
and Legislative Bodies, which have risen and fallen in France, while
the House of Lords and the House of Commons have lived on, with their
powers, their duties, their relations to the Crown, to the Nation, and
to one another, ever silently changing, but with their continuous being
remaining throughout unbroken.But I would again point out that, while the growth of English
institutions has thus gone on almost in obedience to a natural law, the
wisdom, the foresight, the patriotism, of individual statesmen is never
to be put out of our reckoning.There was a given state of things, and
some man had keenness of sight to see what was the right thing to do
in that state of things.Our Constitution has no founder; but there is
one man to whom we may give all but honours of a founder, one man to
whose wisdom and self-devotion we owe that English history has taken
the course which it has taken for the last six hundred years.It might
no doubt have taken that course without him; things might have come
about as they did without any one man coming so prominently to the
front; or, if he had not arisen, some other man might have arisen to do
his work.But we need not speculate as to what might have been; it is
enough that one man did arise to do the work, that there is one man to
whom we owe that the wonderful thirteenth century, the great creative
and destructive age throughout the world(14), was to us an age of
creation and not of destruction.That man, the man who finally gave to
English freedom its second and more lasting shape, the hero and martyr
of England in the greatest of her constitutional struggles, was Simon
of Montfort, Earl of Leicester.If we may not call him the founder of
the English Constitution, we may at least call him the founder of the
House of Commons(15).It was in his age that the new birth of English
freedom began to show itself; it was mainly by his work that that new
birth was not stifled before it had brought forth lasting fruits.Strange it may at first sight seem that the founder of the later
liberties of England was not an Englishman.Simon of Montfort, a native
of France, did for the land of his adoption what even he might not
have been able to do for the land of his birth.The land of
his birth was—shall I say flourishing or suffering?—under the baleful
virtues of the most righteous of Kings.Saint Lewis reigned in France,
Saint Lewis the just and holy, the man who never swerved from the path
of right, the man who swared to his neighbour and disappointed him not,
though it were to his own hindrance.Under his righteous rule there
could be no ground for revolt or disaffection.By surrounding the Crown
with the reflected glory of his own virtues, he did more than any other
man to strengthen its power.He thus did more than any other man to
pave the way for that foul despotism of his successors whose evil deeds
would have daily vexed his righteous soul.In England, on the other
hand, we had the momentary curse, the lasting blessing, of a succession
of evil Kings.We had Kings who had no spark of English feeling in
their breasts, but from whose follies and necessities our fathers were
able to wring their freedom, all the more lastingly because it was bit
by bit that it was wrung.A Latin poet once sang that freedom never
flourishes more brightly than it does under a righteous King(16).And
so it does while that righteous King himself tarries among men.But
to win freedom as an heritage for ever there are times when we have
more need of the vices of Kings than of their virtues.The tyranny of
our Angevin masters woke up English freedom from its momentary grave.Had Richard and John and Henry been Kings like Ælfred and Saint Lewis,
the crosier of Stephen Langton, the sword of Robert Fitzwalter, would
never have flashed at the head of the Barons and people of England; the
heights of Lewes would never have seen the mightiest triumph of her
freedom; the pavement of Evesham choir would never have closed over the
mangled relics of her noblest champion(17).The career of Simon of Montfort is the most glorious in our later
history.Cold must be the heart of every Englishman who does not feel
a thrill of reverence and gratitude as he utters that immortal name.But, fully to understand his work, we must go back somewhat before his
own time, we must go back and trace how the sway of foreign invaders
first made the path ready for the course of the foreign deliverer.I
have shown in what state our Constitution stood at the time of the
Norman Conquest.In that Constitution, be it ever remembered, the
Norman Conquest made no formal change whatever.Daniel went back to the garden.Nothing has had a more
lasting effect on all later English history than the personal character
and position of the Norman Conqueror.But it was not in the character
of a legislator that the main work of William was done.His greatest
work of all was to weld together the still imperfectly united kingdoms
of our ancient England into one indivisible body, a body which, since
his day, no man has ever dreamed of rending asunder.But this was not
the work of any formal legislative enactment; it was the silent result
of the compression of foreign conquest.So it was with William’s whole
policy and position.He was in truth a Conqueror, King by the edge of
the sword, but it was his aim in everything to disguise the fact.He
claimed the Crown by legal right; he received it by the formal election
of the English people, and he was consecrated to his kingly office by
the hands of an English Primate.He professed to rule, not according
to his own will, not according to any laws of his own devising, but
according to the laws of his predecessor and kinsman King Eadward
(18).The great immediate change which was wrought under him was not
any formal legislative change; it was the silent revolution implied in
the transfer—the wary and gradual transfer—of all the greatest estates
and highest offices in England to the hands of foreign holders.The
momentary effect was to make Englishmen on their own soil the subjects
of foreign conquerors.The lasting effect was to change those foreign
conquerors into Englishmen, and to call forth the spirit of English
freedom in a more definite and antagonistic shape than it had ever
before put on.What was the real position of a landowner of Norman
descent within a generation or two after the Conquest?He held English
lands according to English law; in all but the highest rank he lived
on equal terms with other landowners of English birth; he was himself
born on English soil, often of an English mother; he was called on
in endless ways to learn, to obey, and to administer, the laws of
England.Such a man soon became in feeling, and before long in speech
also, as good an Englishman as if he had come of the male line of
Hengest or Cerdic.There was nothing to hinder even one of the actual
conquerors from thoroughly throwing in his lot with his new country
and with its people.His tongue was French, but in truth he had far
more in common with the Englishman than with the Frenchman.He was
but a near kinsman slightly disguised.The Norman was a Dane who, in
his sojourn in Gaul, had put on a slight French varnish, and who came
into England to be washed clean again.The blood of the true Normans,
in the real Norman districts of Bayeux and Coutances, differs hardly
at all from the blood of the inhabitants of the North and East of
England(19).See a French soldier and a Norman farmer side by side,
and you feel at once that the Norman is nothing but a long-parted
kinsman.The general effect of him is that of a man of Yorkshire or
Lincolnshire who has somehow picked up a bad habit of talking French.We have the distinct assertions
of contemporary writers, and every incidental notice bears out their
assertions, that, among all classes between the highest and the lowest,
among all between the great noble and the villain, the distinction of
Norman and Englishman had been forgotten within little more than a
hundred years after the time when King William came into England(20).And presently other causes came to make all the sons of the soil draw
nearer and nearer together.A new dynasty filled the throne, a dynasty
which claimed by female descent to be at once Norman and English, but
which, in origin and feeling, was neither Norman nor English(21).Henry the Second, Count of Anjou through his father, Duke of Aquitaine
through his wife, inherited also his mother’s claims on Normandy and
England, but under him Normandy and England alike were but parts of a
vast dominion which stretched from the Orkneys to the Pyrenees.Under
the mighty, and on the whole the righteous, sway of the great Henry
the worst side of this state of things did not show itself(22).Under
his sons and his grandson England felt to the full the bitterness and
the blessings of the Conquest.The land was overrun by utter strangers;
the men of Old-English birth and the descendants of the first Norman
settlers both saw the natives of other lands placed over the heads of
both alike.Places of trust and honour and wealth were handed over to
foreign favourites, and every man in the land was exposed to a yet
heavier scourge, to the violence and insolence of foreign mercenaries.Under John Normandy was lost(23), and England again became the chief
possession of the King of England.But neither John nor Henry learned
the lesson.The personal vices of the father, the personal virtues of
the son, worked to the same end as far as their kingdom was concerned.The King whose wickedness became a proverb, who surrounded himself
with the kindred ruffians of every nation, and the King whose chief
fault was that he could never say No to his wife or his mother, helped
alike to call forth the spirit of resistance, to draw all Englishmen of
whatever origin nearer together, and thereby to work out the great work
of giving England a free and lasting Constitution.For such Kings we
may well be thankful, but to such Kings we owe no thanks.Our feelings
of personal thankfulness towards any of our later Kings begin only when
a King arose who joined the political skill of Henry the Second to the
personal virtues of Henry the Third, and who added to both a feeling
of English patriotism, a ruling sense of right in public affairs, of
which neither Henry ever felt the slightest spark in his bosom.Edward
the First, the first of our later Kings who bore an English name and an
English heart, was the first round whose name can gather any feelings
of personal thankfulness.In him we see the first of our Kings of
foreign blood who did aught for the growth of our constitutional rights
in some other way than that of calling forth the spirit of resistance
to his rule.Thus it was that the misgovernment of our Angevin Kings called forth
among all the natives of the land an universal spirit of revolt against
the domination of strangers within the realm.And they called forth the
spirit of revolt in another way, a way hardly less important, by their
base subserviency to a foreign power in ecclesiastical matters.I have
here nothing to do with theological dogmas, with their truth or their
falsehood, but the ecclesiastical position of the nation forms a most
important aspect of its history throughout these times.In Old-English
times there can be no doubt as to the existence of an effective
supremacy in ecclesiastical matters on the part of the Crown.The King
was the Supreme Governor of the Church, because he was the Supreme
Governor of the Nation.The Church and the Nation were absolutely the
same; the King and his Witan dealt with ecclesiastical questions and
disposed of ecclesiastical offices by the same right by which they
dealt with temporal questions and disposed of temporal offices(24).The Bishop and the Ealdorman, each appointed by the same authority,
presided jointly in the assembly of the shire, and the assembly over
which they presided dealt freely both with ecclesiastical and with
temporal causes.One of the few formal changes in our Law which took
place in the days of the Conqueror was the separation of the two
jurisdictions of the Bishop and the Ealdorman.One of William’s extant
laws ordained the establishment, according to continental models, of
distinct ecclesiastical courts for the trial of ecclesiastical causes
(25).But more important than this formal change was the practical
result of the Conquest in bringing England into closer connexion than
before with the See of Rome.The enterprise of the Conqueror was
approved by Hildebrand, and it was blessed by the Pope in whose name
Hildebrand already ruled(26).While William lived, the royal supremacy
remained untouched, and, allowing for his position in a conquered
land, we may fairly say that it was not abused.But in meaner hands
the ancient power of the Crown as the representative of the nation was
often abused and often disputed.Quarrels arose as to the limits of
the ecclesiastical and the civil power such as had never been heard of
in the old times.And we must remember that claims which seem utterly
monstrous now were far from seeming monstrous in a state of things so
wholly unlike our times.Even the claim of the clergy to an exemption
from temporal jurisdiction in criminal cases had a very different look
then from what it has now.The privilege thus claimed was by no means
confined to the priesthood; it took in a large part of those among
the people who were least able to defend themselves(27).And when we
think of the horrible punishments, death, and mutilations worse than
death, which the courts of our Angevin Kings freely inflicted for very
slight offences, we can understand that men looked favourably on the
courts of the Bishops, where the heaviest penalties were stripes and
imprisonment.In the disputes between the Crown and the Church, from
William Rufus to Henry the Second, we find popular feeling always
enlisted on the ecclesiastical side(28).Nor need we wonder at this,
when we find among the Constitutions of Clarendon, which King Henry
strove to enforce and which Archbishop Thomas withstood, one which
forbad the ordination of villains without the consent of their lords.That is to say, it cut off from the lowest class the only path by which
they had any hope of rising to posts of honour and authority(29).But
from the reign of John onwards we get a new state of things.A foreign
power stepped in, a power which had as yet meddled but little in the
strictly internal affairs of England, and which, so far as it had
meddled at all, had on the whole taken the popular side.In the latter
days of John and through the whole reign of Henry the Third, we find
the Pope and the King in strict alliance against the English Church
and Nation.The last good deed done by a Pope towards England was when
Innocent the Third sent us Stephen Langton(30).Ever afterwards we
find Pope and King leagued together to back up each other’s oppressions
and exactions.The Papal power was always ready to step in on behalf
of the Crown, always ready to hurl spiritual censures against the
champions of English freedom.The Great Charter was denounced at
Rome; so was its author the patriot Primate(31).Earl Simon died
excommunicate; but, in the belief of Englishmen, the excommunications
of Rome could not hinder an English Earl from working countless signs
and wonders(32)—a pretty convincing argument, one might deem, that the
Bishop of Rome had no jurisdiction in this realm of England.Against
King and Pope the whole nation stood united; clergy and laity, nobles
and commons, men of Norman and men of Old-English birth, all stood
together alike against the King’s foreign favourites and against the
aggressions of Rome.The historians of the age, all of them churchmen,
most of them monks, are all but unanimous on the popular side.Prelates
like the Primate Stephen, like Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln and
Walter of Cantelupe of Worcester, were foremost in the good cause;
the two latter were among the closest friends and counsellors of the
patriot Earl(33).Daniel travelled to the kitchen.We see how old distinctions and old enmities had
been wiped out, how all the sons of the soil were banded together in
one fellowship, when we read the letter denouncing the abuses of the
Roman See which was sent to that See in the name of no less a body
than the whole Nobility, Clergy, and Commons of the English realm.In that letter, an out-spoken and truly English document, which has
been preserved by an historian who well appreciated it, the writers
set forth that, as the Nobles, Clergy, and Commons in whose name it
is written have no common seal, they have, for the signature of their
document, borrowed the seal of the city of London(34).This last fact brings me round to what I first spoke of long ago,
what I may perhaps seem to have forgotten, but what I have in truth
had constantly before my eyes, the distinctly constitutional reforms
which we owe to Earl Simon of Montfort.The fact that a document
which professed to speak in the name of all classes of the whole
nation could not be so fittingly signed as with the seal of the city
of London marks the place which that city held in the political
estimation of the time.But London held that position only as the
greatest member of an advancing class, as the foremost among the
cities and boroughs of England.Now the great work of Earl Simon was
to give those cities and boroughs their distinct place as one of the
elements of the body politic.Let us trace the steps by which that
great work was done.When we reach the thirteenth century, we may look
on the old Teutonic constitution as having utterly passed away.Some
faint traces of it indeed we may find here and there in the course
of the twelfth century, as when both sides in the wars of Stephen and
Matilda acknowledged the right of the citizens of London to a voice
in the disposal of the Crown(35).But the regular Great Council, the
lineal representatives of the ancient _Mycel Gemôt_ or _Witenagemôt_,
was shrinking up into a body not very unlike our House of Lords.Its
constitution, as I have already hinted, was far more fluctuating, far
less strictly hereditary, than the modern body, but it was almost as
far from being in any sense a representation of the people.The Great
Charter secures the rights of the nation and of the national Assembly
as against arbitrary legislation and arbitrary taxation on the part of
the Crown.But it makes no change in the constitution of the Assembly
itself.The greater Barons were to be summoned personally; the lesser
tenants in chief, the representatives of the _landsittende menn_ of
Domesday, were to be summoned by a general writ(36).The Great Charter
in short is a Bill of Rights; it is not what, in modern phrase, we
understand by a Reform Bill.But, during the reigns of John and Henry
the Third, a popular element was fast making its way into the national
Councils in a more practical form.The right of the ordinary freeman
to attend in person had long been a shadow; that of the ordinary
tenant-in-chief was becoming hardly more practical; it now begins to be
exchanged for what had by this time become the more practical right of
choosing representatives to act in his name.Like all other things in
England, this right has grown up by degrees and as the result of what
we might almost call a series of happy accidents.Both in the reign
of John and in the former part of the reign of Henry, we find several
instances of knights from each county being summoned(37).Here we
have the beginning of our county members and of the title which they
still bear, of knights of the shire.Here is the beginning of popular
representation, as distinct from the gathering of the people in their
own persons; but we need not think that those who first summoned them
had any conscious theories of popular representation.The earliest
object for which they were called together was probably a fiscal
one; it was a safe and convenient way of getting money.The notion
of summoning a small number of men to act on behalf of the whole was
doubtless borrowed from the practice in judicial proceedings and in
inquests and commissions of various kinds, in which it was usual for
certain select men to swear on behalf of the whole shire or hundred.We must not forget, though it is a matter on which I have no time to
insist here, that our judicial and our parliamentary institutions are
closely connected, that both sprang out of the primitive Assemblies,
that things which now seem so unlike as our popular juries and the
judicial powers of the House of Lords are in truth both of them
fragments of the judicial powers which Tacitus speaks of as being
vested in those primitive Assemblies.It was only step by step that the
functions of judge, juror, witness, and legislator became the utterly
distinct functions which they are now(38).Thus we find the beginnings of the House of Commons, as we might have
expected, in that class of its members which, for the most part, has
most in common with the already established House of Lords.Thus
far the developement of the Constitution had gone on in its usual
incidental way.Each step in advance, however slight, was doubtless
the work of the discernment of some particular man, even though his
views may not have gone beyond the compassing of some momentary
advantage.But now we come to that great change, that great measure of
Parliamentary Reform, which has left to all later reformers nothing
to do but to improve in detail.We come to that great act of the
patriot Earl which made our popular Chamber really a popular Chamber.A House of knights, of county members, would have been comparatively
an aristocratic body; it would have left out one of the most healthy
and vigorous, and by far the most progressive, element in the nation.When, after the fight of Lewes, Earl Simon, then master of the kingdom
with the King in his safe keeping, summoned his famous Parliament, he
summoned, not only two knights from every county, but also two citizens
from every city and two burgesses from every borough(39).The Earl had
long known the importance and value of the growing civic element in the
political society of his age.When, in an earlier stage of his career,
he held the government of Gascony, he had, on his return to England, to
answer charges brought against him by the Archbishop of Bourdeaux and
the nobles of the province.The Earl’s answer was to bring forward a
writing, giving him the best of characters, which was signed with the
common seal of the city of Bourdeaux(40).As it was in Gascony, so it
was in England.The Earl was always a reformer, one who set himself
to redress practical grievances, to withstand the royal favourites,
to put a check on the oppressions of Pope and King.But his first
steps in the way of reform were made wholly on an aristocratic basis.He tried to redress the grievances of the nation by the help of his
fellow nobles only.Step by step he learned that no true reform could
be wrought for so narrow a platform, and step by step he took into his
confidence, first the knights of the counties, and lastly the class to
whose good will he had owed so much in his earlier trial, the citizens
and burgesses.Through the whole struggle they stood steadily by him;
London was as firm in his cause as Bourdeaux had been, and its citizens
fought and suffered and triumphed with him on the glorious day of
Lewes(41).By a bold and happy innovation, he called a class which had
done so much for him and for the common cause to take their place in
the councils of the nation.It was in Earl Simon’s Parliament of 1265
that the still abiding elements of the popular chamber, the Knights,
Citizens, and Burgesses, first appeared side by side.Thus was formed
that newly developed Estate of the Realm which was, step by step, to
grow into the most powerful of all, the Commons’ House of Parliament.Such was the gift which England received from her noblest champion
and martyr.Nor should it sound strange in our ears that her champion
and martyr was by birth a stranger.We boast ourselves that we have
led captive our conquerors, and that we have made them into sons of
the soil as faithful as ourselves.What we have done with conquerors
we have also done with peaceful settlers.In after days we welcomed
every victim of oppression and persecution, the Fleming, the Huguenot,
and the Palatine.And what we welcomed we adopted and assimilated,
and strengthened our English being with all that was worthiest in
foreign lands.So can we honour, along with the men of English birth,
those men of other lands who have done for England as sons for their
own mother.The Danish Cnut ranks alongside of the worthiest of our
native Kings.Anselm of Aosta ranks alongside of the worthiest of our
native Prelates.And so alongside of the worthiest of our native Earls
we place the glorious name of Simon the Righteous.A stranger, but a
stranger who came to our shores to claim lands and honours which were
his lawful heritage, he became our leader against strangers of another
mould, against the adventurers who thronged the court of a King who
turned his back on his own people.The first noble of England, the
brother-in-law of the King, he threw in his lot, not with princes
or nobles, but with the whole people.He was the chosen leader of
England in his life, and in death he was worshipped as her martyr.In
those days religion coloured every feeling; the patriot who stood up
for right and freedom was honoured alongside of him who suffered for
his faith.We fill our streets and market-places with the statues of
worthies of later days; Peel and Herbert and Lewis and Cobden yet live
among us in bronze or marble.In those days honour to the statesman
was not well distinguished from worship to the saint, and Waltheof
and Simon and Thomas of Lancaster(42) were hailed as sainted patrons
of England, and wonders were held to be wrought by their relics or at
their tombs.The poets of three languages vied in singing the praises
of the man who strove and suffered for right, and Simon, the guardian
of England on the field and in the senate, was held to be her truer
guardian still in the heavenly places from which our fathers deemed
that the curse of Rome had no power to shut him out(43).The great work of the martyred Earl had a strange destiny.His personal
career was cut short, his political work was brought to perfection, by
a rival and a kinsman only less to be honoured than himself.On the
field of Evesham Simon died and Edward triumphed.But it was on Edward
that Simon’s mantle fell; it was to his destroyer that he handed on the
torch which fell from his dying grasp.For a moment his work seemed
to have died with him; for some years Parliaments were still summoned
which were not after the model of the great Assembly which answered
to the writs of the captive Henry.But the model still lived in men’s
hearts, and presently the wisdom of the great Edward saw that his
uncle’s gift could no longer be denied to his people.Parliaments after
Simon’s model have been called together in unbroken succession from
Edward’s day to our own(44).Next to the name of Simon we may honour
the name of Edward himself and the names of the worthies who withstood
him.To Roger Bigod of Norfolk and Humfrey Bohun of Hereford we owe the
crowning of the work(45).The Parliament of England was now wrought
into the fulness of its perfect form, and the most homely, but not the
least important, of its powers was now fully acknowledged.No tax or
gift could the King of England claim at the hands of Englishmen save
such as the Lords and Commons of England had granted him of their free
will(46).Thus we may say that, in the time of Edward the First, the English
Constitution definitely put on the same essential form which it
has kept ever since.The germs of King, Lords, and Commons we had
brought with us from our older home eight hundred years before.But,
from King Edward’s days onwards, we have King, Lords, and Commons
themselves, in nearly the same outward shape, with nearly the same
strictly legal powers, which they still keep.All the great principles
of English freedom were already firmly established.There is indeed
a wide difference between the political condition of England under
Edward the First and the political condition of England in our own
day.But the difference lies far more in the practical working of the
Constitution than in its outward form.The changes have been many; but
a large portion of those changes have not been formal enactments, but
those silent changes whose gradual working has wrought out for us a
conventional Constitution existing alongside of our written Law.Other
changes have been simply improvements in detail; others have been
enactments made to declare more clearly, or to secure more fully in
practice, those rights whose existence was not denied.But, speaking
generally, and allowing for the important class of conventional
understandings which have never been clothed with the form of written
enactments, the main elements of the English Constitution remain now
as they were fixed then.From that time English constitutional history
is not merely an inquiry, however interesting and instructive, into
something which has passed away.It is an inquiry into something which
still lives; it is an inquiry into laws which, whenever they have
not been formally repealed, are in full force at this day.Up to the
reign of Edward the First English history is strictly the domain of
antiquaries.From the reign of Edward the First it becomes the domain
of lawyers(47).We find then—it will be understood with what qualifications I am
speaking—the English Constitution fully grown by the end of the
thirteenth century, and we find it to be, in the shape which it then
took, the work of Earl Simon of Montfort and of King Edward the
First.Now there are several points in which the shape which our
Constitution thus finally took differed from the shapes which were
taken by most of the kindred Constitutions on the Continent.The usual
form taken by a national or provincial assembly in the middle ages
was that of an Assembly of _Estates_.That is to say, it consisted
of representatives of all those classes in the nation which were
possessed of political rights.These in most countries were three,
Nobles, Clergy, and Commons.And the name of the Three Estates, that
is the Nobles, Clergy, and Commons, is equally well known in England,
though the meaning of the three names differs not a little in England
from what it meant elsewhere.In England we never had, unless it were
in the old days of the _Eorlas_, a Nobility such as is understood by
that name in other countries.Elsewhere the nobles formed a distinct
class, a class into which it was perhaps not absolutely impossible for
those who were beneath it to be raised, but from which it was at least
absolutely impossible for any of its members to come down.Whatever the
privileges of the noble might be, they extended to all his children
and their children for ever and ever.In some countries his titles
descend in this way to all his descendants; all the children of a Duke,
for instance, are Dukes and Duchesses.In France, and in most other
countries where the system of Estates existed, the Estate of the Nobles
in the National Assembly was a representation, in some shape or other,
of the whole class of nobles as a distinct body.How different this is
from our House of Lords I need not point out.In strictness, I repeat,
we have no nobility.The seats in our Upper Chamber go by descent and
not by election or nomination; but no political privilege attaches
to the children of their holders.Even the eldest son of the peer,
the future holder of the peerage, is a commoner as long as his father
lives.Whatever titles he bears are simply titles of courtesy which
carry with them no political privileges above other commoners.Nay,
we may go higher still.As the children of the peer have no special
advantage, so neither have the younger children of the King himself.The King’s wife, his eldest son, his eldest daughter, his eldest son’s
wife, all have special privileges by Law.His other children are
simple commoners, unless their father thinks good to raise them, as
he may raise any other of his subjects, to the rank of peerage(48).There is perhaps no feature in our Constitution more important and
more beneficial than this, which binds all ranks together, and which
has hindered us from suffering at any time under the curse of a noble
caste.Yet this marked distinction between our own Constitution and
that of most other countries is purely traditional.We cannot say that
it was enacted by any particular man or in any particular Assembly.But
it is easy to see that the fact that in England our national Assemblies
always went on in some shape or other, that the right of all freemen
to attend in person was never formally abolished, that the King kept
the right of specially summoning whom he would, all helped to hinder
the growth of an exclusive noble caste.The aristocratic sentiment, the
pride of birth, has doubtless been very strong at all times.But it has
been merely a sentiment, resting on no legal foundation.The Crown
could always ennoble any one; but the nobility so granted belonged to
one only of the family at the time, to the actual owner of the peerage.All ranks could at all times freely intermarry; all offices were open
to all freemen; and England, unlike Germany, never saw ecclesiastical
foundations whose members were bound to be of noble birth.The position of the Estate of the Clergy was also widely different in
England from what it was in other countries.In fact the political
position of the Clergy has, ever since Edward the First, been something
utterly anomalous and inconsistent.Elsewhere the representatives of
the Clergy, just like those of the Nobles, formed one distinct Estate
in the Assembly.In England the great Prelates had seats in the House
of Lords, where the Bishops keep them still.But there also existed
the anomalous body called Convocation, whose character has always
fluctuated between that of an ecclesiastical Synod and that of a
parliamentary Estate of the realm(49).The Clergy are still summoned
along with every Parliament; and one distinctly parliamentary function
they held down to the reign of Charles the Second, which was then
taken away without any formal enactment.It was one of our great
constitutional principles established in King Edward’s days that no tax
could be granted to the King except by those who had to pay it.But for
a long time the Lords and the Commons taxed themselves separately, and
the Clergy in their Convocation taxed themselves separately also.And,
till this power was given up, an ecclesiastical benefice gave no right
to vote in the election of members of the House of Commons(50).The Commons too themselves bear a name which had a far different
meaning in England from what it bore elsewhere.The usage by which
the Knights of the shire and the Citizens and Burgesses were brought
together in a single House, whatever was its origin, whether it were
at first the result of design or of happy accident, has been an
usage no less wholesome, no less needful to our full constitutional
developement, than that which decreed that the children of peers
should be commoners.In most other countries the class of men who
were returned as representatives of the counties, the Knights of
the Shire, would have been members of the Estate of the Nobles.In
France the words _nobleman_ and _gentleman_ had the same meaning,
that of the members of an exclusive aristocratic caste.The Commons,
the Third Estate, consisted of the citizens of the privileged towns
only(51).But in England the middle class was not confined to the
towns; it spread itself, in the form of a lesser gentry and a wealthy
yeomanry, over the whole face of the land.That class, the smaller
landowners, was for a long time the strength of the country, and the
happiest results came from the union of their representatives in a
single chamber with those of the cities and boroughs.Each class gained
strength from its fellowship with the other, and the citizen class
gained, from their union on equal terms with the landed gentry, a
consideration which otherwise they might never have reached.In short,
the union of the two, the union of all classes of freemen except the
clergy and the actual members of the peerage, of all classes from the
peer’s eldest son to the smallest freeholder or burgess, made the House
of Commons a real representation of the whole nation, and not of any
single order in the nation.Mark again that the form of government which political writers call
_bi-cameral_, that is to say, where the Legislative Assembly consists
of two Chambers or Houses, arose out of one of the accidents of English
History.The merits of that form of government are now freely under
discussion, but it is assumed on both sides that the only choice
lies between one chamber and two; no one proposes to have three or
four(52).But most of the continental bodies of Estates consisted,
as we have seen, of three Houses; in Sweden, where the peasants, the
small freeholders, were important enough to be separately represented
alongside of the Nobles, Clergy, and Citizens, there were till lately
four(53).The number two became the number of our Houses of Parliament,
not out of any conviction of the advantages of that number, but because
it was found impossible to get the Clergy in England habitually to
act, as they did elsewhere, as a regular member of the parliamentary
body.They shrank from the burthen, or they deemed secular legislation
inconsistent with their profession.Thus, instead of the Clergy
forming, as they did in France, a distinct Estate of the Legislature,
we got a Parliament of two Houses, Lords and Commons, attended by a
kind of ecclesiastical shadow of the Parliament in the shape of the
two Houses of the ecclesiastical Convocation.Thus, for all practical
purposes, there were only two Estates in the English Parliament, Lords
and Commons.Thus the phrase of the Three Estates, which had a meaning
in France, became meaningless in England.For centuries back there has
been no separate Estate of the Clergy; some of their highest members
have belonged to the Estate of the Lords, and the rest to the Estate of
the Commons.Hence has arisen a common but not unnatural misconception,
a misconception as old as the days of the Long Parliament, as to the
meaning of the phrase of the Three Estates.Men constantly use those
words as if they meant the three elements among which the legislative
power is divided, King, Lords, and Commons.But an Estate means a rank
or order or class of men, like the Lords, the Clergy, or the Commons.The King is not an Estate, because there is no class or order of
Kings, the King being one person alone by himself.The proper phrase
is the King and the three Estates of the Realm.But in England, as I
have already shown, the phrase is meaningless, as we have in truth two
Estates only(54).We thus had in England, not an Estate of Nobles, forming a distinct
class from the people, but an Upper House of hereditary and official
Lords, whose privileges were purely personal, and whose children had
no political privilege above other men.Our Bishops and some other of
our ecclesiastical dignitaries had seats in the Upper House, but there
was no distinct Estate of the Clergy, having its distinct voice in
legislation.Our Lower House, lower in name, but gradually to become
upper in real power, came to represent, not merely the inhabitants
of privileged towns, but the whole nation, with the single exception
of the personal holders of hereditary or official seats in the Upper
House.That such an Assembly should gradually draw to itself all the
real powers of the state was in the nature of things; but it was only
gradually that it did so.Few things in our parliamentary history are
more remarkable than the way in which the two Houses have for the most
part worked together.I am not talking of very modern times, but of
times when the two Houses were really coordinate powers in the state.During the six hundred years that the two Houses have lived side by
side, serious disputes between them have been very rare, and those
disputes which have happened have generally had to do with matters of
form and privilege which were chiefly interesting to members of the two
Houses themselves, not with questions which had any great importance
for the nation at large(55).For a while the Commons followed the lead
of the Lords; then the Lords came gradually to follow the lead of the
Commons; but open and violent breaches between the Houses have been
rare indeed.From the days of Earl Simon onwards, both the power of
Parliament as a whole, and the special power of the House of Commons,
was constantly growing.The Parliaments of the fourteenth century
exercised all the powers which our Parliament exercises now, together
with some which modern Parliaments shrink from exercising.That is to
say, the Parliaments of those days were obliged either to do directly
or to leave undone many things which the developement of political
conventionality enables a modern Parliament to do indirectly.The
ancient Parliaments demanded the dismissal of the King’s ministers;
they regulated his personal household; they put his authority into
commission; if need called for such a step, they put forth their last
and greatest power and deposed him from his kingly office.In those
days a change of government, a change of policy, the getting rid of
a bad minister and the putting a better in his place, were things
which never could be done without an open struggle between King and
Parliament; often they could not be done without the bondage, the
imprisonment, or the death, perhaps only of the minister, perhaps even
of the King himself.The same ends can now be gained by a vote of
censure in the House of Commons; in many cases they can be gained even
without a vote of censure, by the simple throwing out of a measure by
which a Ministry has given out that it will stand or fall(56).The fifteenth century, as compared with the thirteenth and fourteenth,
was in some respects a time in which things went back.It is plain
that the Parliaments of that day were bodies which were much less
independent than the Parliaments of earlier times.During the Wars of
the Roses each successive military victor found a Parliament ready to
confirm his claim to the Crown and to decree the condemnation of his
enemies(57).And it was a Parliament of Henry the Sixth which passed
the most reactionary measure which any Parliament ever did pass,
that by which the qualification for a county elector was narrowed to
those freeholders whose estates were of the yearly value of forty
shillings(58).In this case time and the change in the value of money
have redressed the wrong; there may be freeholders whose estates are
under the value of forty shillings, but I cannot think that they are
now a very large or important class.But, to understand the meaning of
the restriction in the fifteenth century, for forty shillings we may
fairly read forty pounds; and certainly, if we struck off the register
all those electors whose qualification is a freehold—much more those
whose qualification is an estate less than a freehold—under the value
of forty pounds, the lessening of the constituencies of our counties
would not be small.On the other hand, during the revolutionary times
which followed, we more than once hear of direct appeals to the people
which remind us of days far earlier.Edward the Fourth and Richard the
Third were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown
acknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us
of the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59).Still even in this age, the
power of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender
to get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the
growing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which
show that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a
shire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for
men of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even
for the sons of members of the Upper House(61).At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary
institutions in so many countries of Europe.Not a few assemblies which
had once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,
either utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities.Then it
was that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free
constitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General
of France met for the last time before their last meeting of all
on the eve of the great Revolution(62).In England parliamentary
institutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty
form.But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,
became perverted into instruments of tyranny.Under Henry the Eighth,
Parliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed
whatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot.Why had they so
fallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they
were to be again?The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained
strength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to
be an independent body.The old nobility had been cut off at Towton
and Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King
to whom they owed their honours.A century later, the new nobility
had inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the
fulness of their power.Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments
of the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant’s will, of
which we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or
of the seventeenth.Very different indeed from the Parliaments which
overthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments
which, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against
any man against whom Henry’s caprice had turned, the Parliaments
which, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready
to enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which
for the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his
son or to his daughters.Why, it may be asked, in such a state of
things, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they
perished in so many other lands?It might be enough to say that no
ruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that
he could so conveniently turn to his own purposes.But why did not
those institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not
do, even in the worst times?One reason undoubtedly is that special
insular position of our country which has in so many other ways
given a peculiar turn to our history.The great foe of parliamentary
institutions was the introduction of standing armies.But the sovereign
of England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing
army than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in
their ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers.But I believe
that the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to
do with the final preservation of our liberties.Do not for a moment
fancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the
Eighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler.Do not think that I claim
for him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for
Earl Simon and King Edward.The position of Henry is more like the
position of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the
Conqueror was in everything the better man of the two.Both served the
cause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features
in the personal character of each.In one respect indeed William and
Henry stood in utterly different positions towards England.William was
a stranger, and it was largely because he was a stranger that he was
able to do us indirect good.Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough
Englishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and
the mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the
occasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke.But the despotism of William
and the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst
deeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law.In the
case of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully
studies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands
boldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history.While his
fellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,
Henry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect.Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and
regular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself
under the sanction either of precedent or of written Law.In itself,
this perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,
is really worse—at all events it is more corrupting—than deeds of open
violence against which men are tempted openly to revolt.But such a
tyranny as Henry’s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;
the careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it
easier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into
its ancient spirit and life.Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the
assent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance
of Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a
step to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64).A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown
in two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of
the House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting
it.One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary
elections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be
corrupt.One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance
of the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage.The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs
which it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was
freely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return
members who would be subservient to the Court(65).Thus arose many
of the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were
disfranchised by our successive Reform Bills.These boroughs, which
always were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must
be carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them.Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in
process of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they
decayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and
so losing the importance which they had once had.The disfranchisement
of both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two
classes should be carefully borne in mind.It was right to take away
its members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right
to give Old Sarum members.In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,
it not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought
to have had members at all(66).It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit
again breathed forth.It is then that we come to the beginning of that
long line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken
order from her days to our own.A few daring spirits in the Commons’
House now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great
Assemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there
was a power in England mightier than their own(67).Under the puny
successor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more
loudly(68).In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King
of England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth
in arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was
a greater power than his.But in the seventeenth century, just as in
the thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were
admitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those
rights and powers which had been handed on from days of old.Into the
details of that great struggle and of the times which followed it is
not my purpose to enter.I have traced at some length the origin and
growth of our Constitution from the earliest times to its days of
special trial in the days of Tudor and Stewart despotism.Our later
constitutional history rather belongs to an inquiry of another kind.It is mainly a record of silent changes in the practical working of
institutions whose outward and legal form remained untouched.I will
therefore end my consecutive historical sketch—if consecutive it can
claim to be—at the point which we have now reached.Instead of carrying
on any regular constitutional narrative into times nearer to our own, I
will rather choose, as the third part of my subject, the illustration
of one of the special points with which I set out, namely the power
which our gradual developement has given us of retracing our steps, of
falling back, whenever need calls for falling back, on the principles
of earlier, often of the earliest, times.Wittingly or unwittingly,
much of our best modern legislation has, as I have already said, been
a case of advancing by the process of going back.As the last division
of the work which I have taken in hand, I shall try to show in how
many cases we have, as a matter of fact, gone back from the cumbrous
and oppressive devices of feudal and royalist lawyers to the sounder,
freer, and simpler principles of the days of our earliest freedom.IN my two former chapters I have carried my brief sketch of the history
of the English Constitution down to the great events of the seventeenth
century.I chose that point as the end of my consecutive narrative,
because the peculiar characteristic of the times which have followed
has been that so many and such important practical changes have been
made without any change in the written Law, without any re-enactment of
the Law, without any fresh declaration of its meaning.The movements
and revolutions of former times, as I have before said, seldom sought
any acknowledged change in the Law, but rather its more distinct
enactment, its more careful and honest administration.This was the
general character of all the great steps in our political history, from
the day when William of Normandy renewed the Laws of Eadward to the day
when William of Orange gave his royal assent to the Bill of Rights.But, though each step in our progress took the shape, not of the
creation of a new right, but of the firmer establishment of an old one,
yet each step was marked by some formal and public act which stands
enrolled among the landmarks of our progress.Some Charter was granted
by the Sovereign, some Act of Parliament was passed by the Estates
of the Realm, setting forth in legal form the nature and measure of
the rights which it was sought to place on a firmer ground.Since
the seventeenth century things have in this respect greatly altered.The work of legislation, of strictly constitutional legislation, has
never ceased; a long succession of legislative enactments stand out as
landmarks of political progress no less in more recent than in earlier
times.But alongside of them there has also been a series of political
changes, changes of no less moment than those which are recorded in the
statute-book, which have been made without any legislative enactment
whatever.A whole code of political maxims, universally acknowledged
in theory, universally carried out in practice, has grown up, without
leaving among the formal acts of our legislature any trace of the
steps by which it grew.Up to the end of the seventeenth century,
we may fairly say that no distinction could be drawn between the
Constitution and the Law.The prerogative of the Crown, the privilege
of Parliament, the liberty of the subject, might not always be clearly
defined on every point.It has indeed been said that those three things
were all of them things to which in their own nature no limit could be
set.But all three were supposed to rest, if not on the direct words
of the Statute Law, yet at least on that somewhat shadowy yet very
practical creation, that mixture of genuine ancient traditions and of
recent devices of lawyers, which is known to Englishmen as the Common
Law.Any breach either of the rights of the Sovereign or of the rights
of the subject was a legal offence, capable of legal definition and
subjecting the offender to legal penalties.An act which could not be
brought within the letter either of the Statute or of the Common Law
would not then have been looked upon as an offence at all.If lower
courts were too weak to do justice, the High Court of Parliament stood
ready to do justice even against the mightiest offenders.It was armed
with weapons fearful and rarely used, but none the less regular and
legal.It could smite by impeachment, by attainder, by the exercise
of the greatest power of all, the deposition of the reigning King.But men had not yet reached the more subtle doctrine that there may
be offences against the Constitution which are no offences against
the Law.They had not learned that men in high office may have a
responsibility practically felt and acted on, but which no legal
enactment has defined, and which no legal tribunal can enforce.It had
not been found out that Parliament itself has a power, now practically
the highest of its powers, in which it acts neither as a legislature
nor as a court of justice, but in which it pronounces sentences which
have none the less practical force because they carry with them none of
the legal consequences of death, bonds, banishment, or confiscation.We
now have a whole system of political morality, a whole code of precepts
for the guidance of public men, which will not be found in any page of
either the Statute or the Common Law, but which are in practice held
hardly less sacred than any principle embodied in the Great Charter
or in the Petition of Right.In short, by the side of our written Law
there has grown up an unwritten or conventional Constitution.When an
Englishman speaks of the conduct of a public man being constitutional
or unconstitutional, he means something wholly different from what he
means by his conduct being legal or illegal.A famous vote of the House
of Commons, passed on the motion of a great statesman, once declared
that the then Ministers of the Crown did not possess the confidence
of the House of Commons, and that their continuance in office was
therefore at variance with the spirit of the Constitution(1).The truth
of such a position, according to the traditional principles on which
public men have acted for some generations, cannot be disputed; but
it would be in vain to seek for any trace of such doctrines in any
page of our written Law.The proposer of that motion did not mean to
charge the existing Ministry with any illegal act, with any act which
could be made the subject either of a prosecution in a lower court
or of impeachment in the High Court of Parliament itself.He did not
mean that they, Ministers of the Crown, appointed during the pleasure
of the Crown, committed any breach of the Law of which the Law could
take cognizance, merely by keeping possession of their offices till
such time as the Crown should think good to dismiss them from those
offices.What he meant was that the general course of their policy was
one which to a majority of the House of Commons did not seem to be
wise or beneficial to the nation, and that therefore, according to a
conventional code as well understood and as effectual as the written
Law itself, they were bound to resign offices of which the House of
Commons no longer held them to be worthy.The House made no claim to
dismiss those Ministers from their offices by any act of its own; it
did not even petition the Crown to remove them from their offices.It
simply spoke its mind on their general conduct, and it was held that,
when the House had so spoken, it was their duty to give way without
any formal petition, without any formal command, on the part either
of the House or of the Sovereign(2).The passing by the House of
Commons of such a resolution as this may perhaps be set down as the
formal declaration of a constitutional principle.But though a formal
declaration, it was not a legal declaration.It created a precedent for
the practical guidance of future Ministers and future Parliaments, but
it neither changed the Law nor declared it.It asserted a principle
which might be appealed to in future debates in the House of Commons,
but it asserted no principle which could be taken any notice of by a
Judge in any Court of Law.It stands therefore on a wholly different
ground from those enactments which, whether they changed the Law or
simply declared the Law, had a real legal force, capable of being
enforced by a legal tribunal.If any officer of the Crown should levy a
tax without the authority of Parliament, if he should enforce martial
law without the authority of Parliament, he would be guilty of a legal
crime.But, if he merely continues to hold an office conferred by the
Crown and from which the Crown has not removed him, though he hold it
in the teeth of any number of votes of censure passed by both Houses of
Parliament, he is in no way a breaker of the written Law.But the man
who should so act would be universally held to have trampled under foot
one of the most undoubted principles of the unwritten but universally
accepted Constitution.The remarkable thing is that, of these two kinds of hypothetical
offences, the latter, the guilt of which is purely conventional, is
almost as unlikely to happen as the former, whose guilt is a matter
established by Law.The power of the Law is so firmly established among
us that the possibility of breaches of the Law on the part of the
Crown or its Ministers hardly ever comes into our heads.And conduct
sinning against the broad lines of the unwritten Constitution is looked
on as hardly less unlikely.Political men may debate whether such and
such a course is or is not constitutional, just as lawyers may debate
whether such a course is or is not legal.But the very form of the
debate implies that there is a Constitution to be observed, just as
in the other case it implies that there is a Law to be observed.Now
this firm establishment of a purely unwritten and conventional code
is one of the most remarkable facts in history.It is plain that it
implies the firmest possible establishment of the power of the written
Law as its groundwork.If there were the least fear of breaches of the
written Law on the part of the Crown or its officers, we should be
engaged in finding means for getting rid of that more serious danger,
not in disputing over points arising out of a code which has no legal
existence.But it is well sometimes to stop and remember how thoroughly
conventional the whole of our received system is.The received doctrine
as to the relations of the two Houses of Parliament to one another, the
whole theory of the position of the body known as the Cabinet and of
its chief the Prime Minister, every detail in short of the practical
working of government among us, is a matter belonging wholly to the
unwritten Constitution and not at all to the written Law.The limits
of the royal authority are indeed clearly defined by the written Law.But I suspect that many people would be amazed at the amount of power
which the Crown still possesses by Law, and at the many things, which
in our eyes would seem utterly monstrous, but which might yet be done
by royal authority without any law being broken.The Law indeed secures
us against arbitrary legislation, against the repeal of any old laws,
or the enactment of any new ones, without the consent of both Houses
of Parliament(3).But it is the unwritten Constitution alone which
makes it practically impossible for the Crown to refuse its assent to
measures which have passed both Houses of Parliament, and which in many
cases makes it almost equally impossible to refuse the prayer of an
address sent up by one of those Houses only.The written Law leaves to
the Crown the choice of all its ministers and agents, great and small;
their appointment to office and their removal from office, as long as
they commit no crime which the Law can punish, is a matter left to
the personal discretion of the Sovereign.The unwritten Constitution
makes it practically impossible for the Sovereign to keep a Minister
in office of whom the House of Commons does not approve, and it makes
it almost equally impossible to remove from office a Minister of
whom the House of Commons does approve(4).The written Law and the
unwritten Constitution alike exempt the Sovereign from all ordinary
personal responsibility(5).They both transfer the responsibility from
the Sovereign himself to his agents and advisers.But the nature and
extent of their responsibility is widely different in the eyes of the
written Law and in the eyes of the unwritten Constitution.The written
Law is satisfied with holding that the command of the Sovereign is no
excuse for an illegal act, and that he who advises the commission of
an illegal act by royal authority must bear the responsibility from
which the Sovereign himself is free.The written Law knows nothing of
any responsibility but such as may be enforced either by prosecution in
the ordinary Courts or by impeachment in the High Court of Parliament.The unwritten Constitution lays the agents and advisers of the Crown
under a responsibility of quite another kind.What we understand by
the responsibility of Ministers is that they are liable to have all
their public acts discussed in Parliament, not only on the ground
of their legal or illegal character, but on the vaguest grounds of
their general tendency.They may be in no danger of prosecution or
impeachment; but they are no less bound to bow to other signs of the
will of the House of Commons; the unwritten Constitution makes a
vote of censure as effectual as an impeachment, and in many cases it
makes a mere refusal to pass a ministerial measure as effectual as a
vote of censure.The written Law knows nothing of the Cabinet or the
Prime Minister; it knows them as members of one or the other House of
Parliament, as Privy Councillors, as holders, each man in his own
person, of certain offices; but, as a collective body bound together
by a common responsibility, the Law never heard of them(6).But in the
eye of the unwritten Constitution the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of
which he is the head form the main feature of our system of government.It is plain at a moment’s glance that the practical power of the Crown
is not now what it was in the reign of William the Third or even in
that of George the Third.But the change is due, far less to changes in
the written Law than to changes in the unwritten Constitution.The Law
leaves the powers of the Crown untouched, but the Constitution requires
that those powers should be exercised by such persons, and in such a
manner, as may be acceptable to a majority of the House of Commons.In
all these ways, in a manner silent and indirect, the Lower House of
Parliament, as it is still deemed in formal rank, has become the really
ruling power in the nation.There is no greater contrast than that
which exists between the humility of its formal dealings with the Crown
and even with the Upper House(7), and the reality of the irresistible
power which it exercises over both.It is so conscious of the mighty
force of its indirect powers that it no longer cares to claim the
direct powers which it exercised in former times.There was a time
when Parliament was directly consulted on questions of War and Peace.There was a time when Parliament claimed directly to appoint several
of the chief officers of state(8).There were much later times when it
was no unusual thing to declare a man in power to be a public enemy,
or directly to address the Crown for his removal from office and from
the royal presence.No such direct exercises of parliamentary power are
needed now, because the whole machinery of government may be changed by
the simple process of the House refusing to pass a measure on which the
Minister has made up his mind to stake his official being.Into the history of the stages by which this most remarkable state
of things has been brought about I do not intend here to enter.The
code of our unwritten Constitution has, like all other English things,
grown up bit by bit, and, for the most part, silently and without any
acknowledged author.Yet some stages of the developement are easily
pointed out, and they make important landmarks.The beginning may be
placed in the reign of William the Third, when we first find anything
at all like a _Ministry_ in the modern sense.Up to that time the
servants of the Crown had been servants of the Crown, each man in
the personal discharge of his own office.The holder of each office
owed faithful service to the Crown, and he was withal responsible to
the Law; but he stood in no special fellowship towards the holder
of any other office.Provided he discharged his own duties, nothing
hindered him from being the personal or political enemy of any of his
fellow-servants.It was William who first saw that, if the King’s
government was to be carried on, there must be at least a general
agreement of opinions and aims among the King’s chief agents in his
government(9).From this beginning a system has gradually grown up
which binds the chief officers of the Crown to work together in at
least outward harmony, to undertake the defence of one another, and
on vital points to stand and fall together.Another important stage
happened in much later times, when the King ceased to take a share in
person in the deliberations of his Cabinet.And I may mark a change
in language which has happened within my own memory, and which, like
other changes of language, is certainly not without its meaning.We
now familiarly speak, in Parliament and out of Parliament, of the body
of Ministers actually in power, the body known to the Constitution but
wholly unknown to the Law, by the name of “the Government.” We speak
of “Mr.Gladstone’s Government” or “Mr.Disraeli’s Government.” I can
myself remember the time when such a form of words was unknown, when
“Government” still meant “Government by King, Lords, and Commons,” and
when the body of men who acted as the King’s immediate advisers were
spoken of as “Ministers” or “the Ministry”(10).This kind of silent, I might say stealthy, growth, has, without
the help of any legislative enactment, produced that unwritten
and conventional code of political rules which we speak of as the
Constitution.This process I have spoken of as being characteristic
of the days since the Revolution of 1688, as distinguished from
earlier times.At no earlier time have so
many important changes in constitutional doctrine and practice won
universal acceptance without being recorded in any written enactment.Yet this tendency of later times is, after all, only a further
developement of a tendency which was at work from the beginning.It
is simply another application of the Englishman’s love of precedent.The growth of the unwritten Constitution has much in common with the
earlier growth of the unwritten Common Law.I have shown in earlier
chapters that some of the most important principles of our earlier
Constitution were established silently and by the power of precedent,
without resting on any known written enactment.If we cannot show any
Act of Parliament determining the relations in which the members of
the Cabinet stand to the Crown, to the House of Commons, and to one
another, neither can we show the Act of Parliament which decreed, in
opposition to the practice of all other nations, that the children of
the hereditary Peer should be simple Commoners.The real difference is
that, in more settled times, when Law was fully supreme, it was found
that many important practical changes might be made without formal
changes in the Law.It was also found that there is a large class of
political subjects which can be better dealt with in this way of tacit
understandings than they can be in the shape of a formal enactment by
Law.We practically understand what is meant by Ministers having or not
having the confidence of the House of Commons; we practically recognise
the cases in which, as not having the confidence of the House, they
ought to resign office and the cases in which they may fairly appeal
to the country by a dissolution of Parliament.But it would be utterly
impossible to define such cases beforehand in the terms of an Act of
Parliament.Or again, the Speaker of the House of Commons is an officer
known to the Law.The Leader of the House of Commons is a person as
well known to the House and the country, his functions are as well
understood, as those of the Speaker himself.But of the Leader of the
House of Commons the Law knows nothing.It would be hopeless to seek to
define his duties in any legal form, and the House itself has, before
now, shrunk from recognising the existence of such a person in any
shape of which a Court of Law could take notice(11).During a time then which is now not very far short of two hundred
years, the silent and extra-legal growth of our conventional
Constitution has been at least as important as the actual changes
in our written Law.With regard to these last, the point on which I
wish chiefly to dwell is the way in which not a few pieces of modern
legislation have been—whether wittingly or unwittingly I do not profess
to know—a return to the simpler principles of our oldest constitution.I trust to show that, in many important points, we have cast aside
the legal subtleties which grew up from the thirteenth century to the
seventeenth, and that we have gone back to the plain common sense of
the eleventh or tenth, and of times far earlier still.In those ancient
times we had already laws, but we had as yet no lawyers.We hear in
early times of men who were versed above others in the laws of the
land; but such special knowledge is spoken of as the attribute of age
or of experience in public business, not as the private possession of
a professional class(12).The class of professional lawyers grew up
along with the growth of a more complicated and technical jurisprudence
under our Norman and Angevin Kings.Now I mean no disrespect to
a profession which in our present artificial state of society we
certainly cannot do without, but there can be no kind of doubt that
lawyers’ interpretations and lawyers’ ways of looking at things have
done no small mischief, not only to the true understanding of our
history but to the actual course of our history itself.The lawyer’s
tendency is to carry to an unreasonable extent that English love of
precedent which, within reasonable bounds, is one of our most precious
safeguards.His virtue is that of acute and logical inference from
given premisses; the premisses themselves he is commonly satisfied to
take without examination from those who have gone before him.It is
often wonderful to see the amazing ingenuity with which lawyers have
piled together inference upon inference, starting from some purely
arbitrary assumption of their own.Each stage of the argument, taken
by itself, is absolutely unanswerable; the objection must be taken
earlier, before the argument begins.The argument is perfect, if we
only admit the premisses; the only unlucky thing is that the premisses
will constantly be found to be historically worthless.Add to this that
the natural tendency of the legal mind is to conservatism and deference
to authority.This will always be the case, even with thoroughly
honest men in an age when honesty is no longer dangerous.But this
tendency will have tenfold force in times when an honest setting forth
of the Law might expose its author to the disfavour of an arbitrary
government.We shall therefore find that the premisses from which
lawyers’ arguments have started, but which historical study shows to be
unsound, are commonly premisses devised in favour of the prerogative
of the Crown, not in favour of the rights of the people.Indeed the
whole ideal conception of the Sovereign, as one, personally at least,
above the Law, as one personally irresponsible and incapable of doing
wrong, the whole conception of the Sovereign as the sole fountain of
all honour, as the original grantor of all property, as the source
from which all authority of every kind issues in the first instance,
is purely a lawyer’s conception, and rests upon no ground whatever in
the records of our early history(13).In later times indeed the evil
has largely corrected itself; the growth of our unwritten Constitution
under the hands of statesmen has done much practically to get rid of
these slavish devices of lawyers.The personal irresponsibility of the
Sovereign becomes practically harmless when the powers of the Crown are
really exercised by Ministers who act under a twofold responsibility,
both to the written Law and to the unwritten Constitution.Yet even
now small cases of hardship sometimes happen in which some traditional
maxim of lawyers, some device devised in favour of the prerogative of
the Crown, stands in the way of the perfectly equal administration
of justice.But in several important cases the lawgiver has directly
stepped in to wipe out the inventions of the lawyer, and modern Acts of
Parliament have brought things back to the simpler principles of our
earliest forefathers.I will wind up my sketch of our constitutional
history by pointing out several cases in which this happy result has
taken place.For many ages it was a legal doctrine universally received that
Parliament at once expired at the death of the reigning King.The
argument by which the lawyers reached this conclusion is, like most of
their arguments, altogether unanswerable, provided only we admit their
premisses.According to the lawyers’ conception, whatever might be the
powers of Parliament when it actually came together, however much the
King might be bound to act by its advice, consent, and authority, the
Parliament itself did nevertheless derive its being from the authority
of the King.Parliament was summoned by the King’s writ.The King
might indeed be bound to issue the writs for its summons; still it was
from the King’s writ that the Parliament actually derived its being
and its powers.By another legal assumption, the force of the King’s
writ was held to last only during the lifetime of the King who issued
it.It followed therefore that Parliament, summoned by the King’s
writ and deriving its authority from the King’s writ, was dissolved
_ipso facto_ by the death of the King who summoned it.Once admit the
assumptions from which this reasoning starts, and the reasoning itself
is perfect.Let us see how
this mass of legal subtlety would have looked in the eyes of a man of
the eleventh century, in the eyes of a man who had borne his part in
the elections of Eadward and of Harold, and who had raised his voice
and clashed his arms in the great Assembly which restored Godwine to
his lands and honours(14).To such an one the doctrine that a national
Assembly could be gathered together only by the King’s writ, and the
consequent doctrine that the national Assembly ceased to exist when the
breath went out of the King’s body, would have seemed like the babble
of a madman.When was the gathering together of the national Assembly
more needed, when was it called upon to exercise higher and more
inherent powers, than when the throne was actually vacant, and when
the Assembly of the nation came together to determine who should fill
it?And how could the Assembly be gathered together by the King’s writ
when there was no King in the land to issue a writ?The King’s writ
would be, in his eyes, a convenient way in ordinary times for fixing
a time and place for the meetings of the Assembly, but it would be
nothing more.It would be in no sense the source of the powers of the
Assembly, powers which he would look upon as derived from the simple
fact that the Assembly was itself the nation.In his eyes it was not
the King who created the Assembly, but the Assembly which created the
King.The doctrine that the King never dies, that the throne never can
be vacant, would have seemed gibberish to one who had seen the throne
vacant and had borne his part in filling it.The doctrine that the
King can do no wrong would have seemed no less gibberish to one who
knew that he might possibly be called on to bear his part in deposing
a King.Three of the most famous Assemblies in English history have
ever been puzzles in the eyes of mere legal interpreters; to the man of
the eleventh century they would have seemed to be perfectly legal and
regular, alike in their constitution and in their acts.The Assembly
which in 1399 deposed Richard the Second and elected Henry the Fourth,
though summoned by the King’s writ, was not opened by his commission,
and it seems to have shrunk from taking the name of Parliament, and to
have acted only by the name of the Estates of the Realm.As an Assembly
which was in some sort irregular, it seems to have shrunk from going
through the usual forms of a regular Parliament, and, though it did
in the end exercise the greatest of parliamentary powers, it seems to
have been afraid to look its own act in the face.Richard was deposed,
but his deposition was mixed up with a resignation of the Crown on
his own part, and with a challenge of the Crown on the part of Henry.Then, as a demise of the Crown had taken place, it was held that the
same legal consequences followed as if that demise had been caused by
the death of the King.It was held that the Parliament which had been
summoned by the writ of King Richard ceased to exist when Richard
ceased to be King, and, as it was not thought good to summon a new
Parliament, the same Parliament was, by a legal fiction, summoned again
under the writ of King Henry(15).All these doubts and difficulties,
all these subtleties of lawyers, would have been wholly unintelligible
to a man of the eleventh century.In his eyes the Witan would have come
together, whether by King Richard’s writ or not it mattered little;
having come together, they had done the two greatest of national acts
by deposing one King and choosing another; having done this, if there
was any other national business to be done, there was no reason on
earth why they should not go on and do it.Take again another Assembly
of equal importance in our history, the Convention which voted the
recall—that is, in truth, the election—of Charles the Second.That
Assembly succeeded a Parliament which had ventured on a still stronger
step than deposing a King, that of sending a reigning King to trial and
execution(16).It was not held in 1649 that the Long Parliament came
to an end when the axe fell on the neck of Charles the First, but the
doctrine that it ought to have done so was not forgotten eleven years
later(17).And the Convention which was elected, as freely as any
Parliament ever was elected(18), in answer to the vote of the expiring
Long Parliament, was, because it was so elected and not in answer to
the King’s writ, looked on as an Assembly of doubtful validity.It
acted as a Parliament; it restored the King; it granted him a revenue;
and it did a more wonderful work than all, for it created itself, and
passed an Act declaring itself to be a lawful Parliament(19).Yet,
after all, it was deemed safer that all the Acts of the Convention
Parliament should be confirmed by its successor which was summoned in
due form by the King’s writ.These fantastic subtleties, subtleties
worthy of the kindred device by which the first year of Charles’s reign
was called the twelfth, would again have been wholly unintelligible
to our man of the eleventh century.He might have remembered that the
Assembly which restored Æthelred—which restored him on conditions,
while Charles was restored without conditions—did not scruple to go on
and pass a series of the most important decrees that were passed in
any of our early Assemblies(20).Once more again, the Convention which
deposed James and elected William, seemed, like that which deposed
Richard and elected Henry, to doubt its own existence and to shrink
from its own act.James was deposed; but the Assembly which deposed
him ventured not to use the word, and, as an extorted abdication was
deemed expedient in the case of Richard, so a constructive abdication
was imagined in the case of James(21).And the Assembly which elected
William, like the Assembly which elected Henry and that which elected
Charles, prolonged its own existence by the same transparent fiction
of voting itself to be a lawful Parliament.Wise men held at the time
that, at least in times of revolution, a Parliament might be called
into being by some other means than that of the writ of a King.Yet it
was deemed that some additional security was given to the existence of
the Assembly and to the validity of its acts by this second exercise
of the mysterious power of self-creation(22).Once more in the same
reign the question was brought forward whether a Parliament summoned
by the joint writ of William and Mary did not expire when Mary died
and William reigned alone.This subtlety was suggested only to be
contemptuously cast aside; yet it may be fairly doubted whether it was
not worth at least as much as any of the kindred subtleties which on
the three earlier occasions were deemed of such vast importance(23).The untutored wisdom of Englishmen, in the days when we had laws but
when those laws had not yet been made the sport of the subtleties of
lawyers, would have seen as little force in the difficulties which it
was deemed necessary to get over by solemn parliamentary enactments as
in the difficulty which neither House of Parliament thought worthy of
any serious discussion.And now what has modern legislation done towards getting rid of all
these pettifogging devices, and towards bringing us back to the simpler
doctrines of our forefathers?Parliament is still summoned by the
writ of the Sovereign; in settled times no other way of bringing it
together can be so convenient.But, if times of revolution should ever
come again, we, who do even our revolutions according to precedent,
shall probably have learned something from the revolutionary precedents
of 1399, of 1660, and of 1688.In each later case the subtlety is
one degree less subtle than in the former.The Estates of the Realm
which deposed Richard were changed into a Parliament of Henry by the
transparent fiction of sending out writs which were not, and could not
be, followed by any real elections.The Convention which recalled or
elected Charles the Second did indeed turn itself into a Parliament,
but it was deemed needful that its acts should be confirmed by another
Parliament.The acts of the Convention of 1688 were not deemed to need
any such confirmation.Each of these differences marks a stage in the
return to the doctrine of common sense, that, convenient as it is in
all ordinary times that Parliament should be summoned by the writ of
the Sovereign, yet it is not from that summons, but from the choice of
the people, that Parliament derives its real being and its inherent
powers.As for the other end of the lawyers’ doctrine, the inference
that Parliament is _ipso facto_ dissolved by a demise of the Crown,
from that a more rational legislation has set us free altogether.Though modern Parliaments are no longer called on to elect Kings, yet
experience and common sense have taught us that the time when the
Sovereign is changed is exactly the time when the Great Council of
the Nation ought to be in full life and activity.By a statute only a
few years later than the raising of the question whether a Parliament
of William and Mary did or did not expire by the death of Mary, all
such subtleties were swept away.It was now deemed so needful that the
new Sovereign should have a Parliament ready to act with him, that it
became the Law that the Parliament which was in being at the time of
a demise of the Crown should remain in being for six months, unless
specially dissolved by the new Sovereign.A later statute went further
still, and provided that, if a demise of the Crown should take place
during the short interval when there is no Parliament in being, the
last Parliament should _ipso facto_ revive, and should continue in
being, unless a second time dissolved, for six months more.Thus the
event which, by the perverted ingenuity of lawyers, was held to have
the power of destroying a Parliament, was, by the wisdom of later
legislation, clothed with the power of calling a Parliament into being.Lastly, in our own days, all traces of the lawyers’ superstition have
been swept away, and the demise of the Crown now in no way affects the
duration of the existing Parliament(24).Truly this is a case where
the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life.The doctrine which had
been inferred by unanswerable logic from an utterly worthless premiss
has been cast aside in favour of the dictate of common sense.We have
learned that the moment when the State has lost its head is the last
moment which we ought to choose for depriving it of its body also.Here then is a notable instance of the way in which the latest
legislation of England has fallen back upon the principles of the
earliest.Here is a point on which the eleventh century and the
nineteenth are of one mind, and on which the fanciful scruples of the
fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries are no longer listened to.In the old Teutonic Constitution, just as in
the old Roman Constitution, large tracts of land were the property of
the State, the _ager publicus_ of Rome, the _folkland_ of England.As
the royal power grew, as the King came to be more and more looked on
as the impersonation of the nation, the land of the people came to be
more and more looked on as the land of the King, and the _folkland_
of our Old-English charters gradually changed into the _Terra Regis_
of Domesday(25).Like other changes of the kind, the Norman Conquest
only strengthened and brought to its full effect a tendency which was
already at work; but there can be no doubt that, down to the Norman
Conquest, the King at least went through the form of consulting his
Witan, before he alienated the land of the people to become the
possession of an individual—in Old-English phrase, before he turned
_folkland_ into _bookland_(26).After the Norman Conquest we hear no
more of the land of the people; it has become the land of the King, to
be dealt with according to the King’s personal pleasure.From the days
of the first William to those of the Third, the land which had once
been the land of the people was dealt with without any reference to
the will of the people.Under a conscientious King it might be applied
to the real service of the State, or bestowed as the reward of really
faithful servants of the State.Under an unconscientious King it might
be squandered broadcast among his minions or his mistresses(27).A custom as strong as law now requires
that, at the beginning of each fresh reign, the Sovereign shall, not
by an act of bounty but by an act of justice, give back to the nation
the land which the nation lost so long ago.The royal demesnes are now
handed over to be dealt with like the other revenues of the State, to
be disposed of by Parliament for the public service(28).That is to
say, the people have won back their own; the usurpation of the days of
foreign rule has been swept away.We have in this case too gone back
to the sound principles of our forefathers; the _Terra Regis_ of the
Norman has once more become the _folkland_ of the days of our earliest
freedom.I will quote another case, a case in which the return from the
fantasies of lawyers to the common sense of antiquity has been
distinctly to the profit, if not of the abstraction called the Crown,
yet certainly to that of its personal holder.As long as the _folkland_
remained the land of the people, as long as our monarchy retained
its ancient elective character, the King, like any other man, could
inherit, purchase, bequeath, or otherwise dispose of, the lands which
were his own private property as much as the lands of other men were
theirs.We have the wills of several of our early Kings which show that
a King was in this respect as free as any other man(29).But as the
lawyers’ figment of hereditary right took root, as the other lawyers’
figment also took root by which the lands of the people were held to
be at the personal disposal of the King, a third figment grew up, by
which it was held that the person and the office of the King were so
inseparably fused into one that any private estates which the King held
before his accession to the throne became _ipso facto_ part and parcel
of the royal demesne.As long as the Crown remained an elective office,
the injustice of such a rule would have made itself plain; it would
have been at once seen to be as unreasonable as if it had been held
that the private estates of a Bishop should merge in the estates of
his see.As long as there was no certainty that the children or other
heirs of the reigning King would ever succeed to his Crown, it would
have been the height of injustice to deprive them in this way of their
natural inheritance.The election of a King would have carried with
it the confiscation of his private estate.But when the Crown was held
to be hereditary, when the _folkland_ was held to be _Terra Regis_,
this hardship was no longer felt.The eldest son was provided for by
his right of succession to the Crown, and the power of disposing of the
Crown lands at pleasure gave the King the means of providing for his
younger children.Still the doctrine was none the less unreasonable;
it was a doctrine founded on no ground either of natural justice or of
ancient law; it was a mere inference which had gradually grown up out
of mere arbitrary theories about the King’s powers and prerogatives.And, as the old state of things gradually came back again, as men
began to feel that the demesnes of the Crown were not the private
possession of the reigning King, but were the true possession of the
people—that is, as the _Terra Regis_ again came back to its old state
of _folkland_—it was felt to be unreasonable to shut out the Sovereign
from a natural right which belonged to every one of his subjects.The
land which, to put it in the mildest form, the King held in trust for
the common service of the nation was now again employed to its proper
use.It was therefore reasonable that a restriction which belonged
to a past state of things should be swept away, and that Sovereigns
who had given up an usurped power which they ought never to have held
should be restored to the enjoyment of a natural right which ought
never to have been taken from them.As our present Sovereign in so many
other respects holds the place of Ælfred rather than the place of the
Richards and Henries of later times, so she again holds the right which
Ælfred held, of acquiring and disposing of private property like any
other member of the nation(30).These examples are, I hope, enough to make out my case.In each of them
modern legislation has swept away the arbitrary inferences of lawyers,
and has gone back to those simpler principles which the untutored
wisdom of our forefathers never thought of calling in question.I
could easily make the list much longer.Every act which has restrained
the arbitrary prerogative of the Crown, every act which has secured
or increased either the powers of Parliament or the liberty of the
subject, has been a return, sometimes to the letter, at all times to
the spirit, of our earliest Law.But I would enlarge on one point
only, the most important point of all, and a point in which we may
at first sight seem, not to have come nearer, but to have gone away
further from the principles of early times.I mean with regard to the
succession to the Crown.The Crown was of old, as I have already said,
elective.No man had a right to become King till he had been called
to the kingly office by the choice of the Assembly of the nation.No
man actually was King till he had been admitted to the kingly office
by the consecration of the Church.The doctrines that the King never
dies, that the throne never can be vacant, that there can be no
interregnum, that the reign of the next heir begins the moment the
reign of his predecessor is ended, are all figments of later times.No signs of such doctrines can be found at any time earlier than the
accession of Edward the First(31).The strong preference which in early
times belonged to members of the kingly house, above all to the born
son of a crowned King(32), gradually grew, under the influences which
the Norman Conquest finally confirmed, into the doctrine of absolute
hereditary right.That doctrine grew along with the general growth of
the royal power; it grew as men gradually came to look on kingship as
a possession held by a single man for his own profit, rather than as
an office bestowed by the people for the common good of the realm.It
might seem that, in this respect at least, we have not gone forward,
but that we rather have gone back.For nothing is more certain than
that the Crown is more strictly and undoubtedly hereditary now than it
was in the days of Normans, Angevins, or Tudors.But a little thought
will show that in this case also, we have not gone back but have gone
forward.That is to say, we have gone forward by going back, by going
back, in this case, not to the letter, but assuredly to the spirit of
earlier times.The Crown is now more undoubtedly hereditary than it
was in the fifteenth or sixteenth century; but this is because it is
now hereditary by Law, because its powers are distinctly defined by
Law.The will of the people, the source of all Law and of all power,
has been exercised, not in the old form of personally choosing a King
at every vacancy of the Crown, but by an equally lawful exercise of
the national will, which has thought good to entail the Crown on a
particular family.It was in the reign of our last elective King that the Crown first
became legally hereditary.The doctrine may seem a startling one, but
it is one to which an unbiassed study of our history will undoubtedly
lead us.Few things are more amusing than the treatment which our early
history has met with at the hands of purely legal writers.There is
something almost pitiable in the haltings and stumblings of such a
writer as Blackstone, unable to conceive that his lawyer’s figment
of hereditary right was anything short of eternal, and yet coming at
every moment across events which showed that in early times all such
figments were utterly unknown(33).In early times the King was not
only elected, but he went through a twofold election.I have already
said that the religious character with which most nations have thought
good to clothe their Kings took in England, as in most other Christian
lands, the form of an ecclesiastical consecration to the kingly office.That form we still retain; but in modern times it has become a mere
form, a pageant impressive no doubt and instructive, but still a mere
pageant, which gives the crowned King no powers which he did not
equally hold while still uncrowned.The death of the former King at
once puts his successor in possession of every kingly right and power;
his coronation in no way adds to his legal authority, however much it
may add to his personal responsibility towards God and his people.But
this was not so of old time.The choice of the national Assembly gave
the King so chosen the sole right to become King, but it did not make
him King.The King-elect was like a Bishop-elect.The recommendation
of the Crown, the election of the Chapter, and the confirmation of the
Archbishop, give a certain man the sole right to a certain see, but
it is only the purely religious rite of consecration which makes him
actually Bishop of it(34).The choice
of the Witan made him King-elect, but it was only the ecclesiastical
crowning and anointing which made him King.And this ecclesiastical
ceremony involved a further election.Chosen already to the civil
office by the Nation in its civil character, he was again chosen by
the Church—that is, by the Nation in its religious character, by the
Clergy and People assembled in the church where the crowning rite was
to be done(35).This second ecclesiastical election must always have
been a mere form, as the choice of
