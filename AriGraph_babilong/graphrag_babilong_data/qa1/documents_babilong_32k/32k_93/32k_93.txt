Modes of life in the mountains were
familiar to him, and with the consciousness of having done a kind deed
from which further good might result, he was in a mood to speak freely of
the Lumleys, and the story of their experience was soon drawn from him.Impulsive, warm-hearted Burt was outspoken in his admiration of Amy's
part in the visit of charity, but Webb's intent look drew her eyes to
him, and with a strange little thrill at her heart she saw that he had
interpreted her motives and feelings."I will take you there again, Amy," was all he said, but for some reason
she dwelt upon the tone in which he spoke more than upon all the uttered
words of the others.Later in the evening he joined her in the sitting-room, which, for the
moment, was deserted by the others, and she spoke of the wintry gloom of
the mountains, and how Leonard was fond of making the forbidding aspect a
foil for Maggie's room.Webb smiled as he replied:

"That is just like Len.Maggie's room is the centre of his world, and he
sees all things in their relation to it.I also was out this afternoon,
and I took my gun, although I did not see a living thing to fire at.But
the'still, cold woods,' as you term them, were filled with a beauty and
suggestiveness of which I was never conscious before.I remembered how
different they had appeared in past summers and autumns, and I saw how
ready they were for the marvellous changes that will take place in a few
short weeks.The hillsides seemed like canvases on which an artist had
drawn his few strong outlines which foretold the beauty to come so
perfectly that the imagination supplied it.""Why, Webb, I did not know you had so much imagination.""Nor did I, and I am glad that I am discovering traces of it.I have always
loved the mountains, because so used to them--they were a part of my life
and surroundings--but never before this winter have I realized they were so
beautiful.When I found that you were going up among the hills, I thought I
would go also, and then we could compare our impressions.""It was all too dreary for me," said the young girl, in a low tone."It
reminded me of the time when my old life ceased, and this new life had
not begun.There were weeks wherein my heart was oppressed with a cold,
heavy despondency, when I just wished to be quiet, and try not to think
at all, and it seemed to me that nature looked to-day just I felt.""I think it very sad that you have learned to interpret nature in this
way so early in life.And yet I think I can understand you and your
analogy.""I think you can, Webb," she said, simply.CHAPTER XIII

ALMOST A TRAGEDY


The quiet sequence of daily life was soon interrupted by circumstances
that nearly ended in a tragedy.One morning Burt saw an eagle sailing
over the mountains.The snow had been greatly wasted, and in most places
was so strongly incrusted that it would bear a man's weight.Therefore
the conditions seemed favorable for the eagle hunt which he had promised
himself; and having told his father that he would look after the wood
teams and men on his way, he took his rifle and started.The morning was not cold, and not a breath of air disturbed the sharp,
still outlines of the leafless trees.The sky was slightly veiled with a
thin scud of clouds.As the day advanced these increased in density and
darkened in hue.Webb remarked at dinner that the atmosphere over the Beacon Hills in the
northeast was growing singularly obscure and dense in its appearance, and
that he believed a heavy storm was coming."I am sorry Burt has gone to the mountains to-day," said Mrs."Oh, don't worry about Burt," was Webb's response; "there is no more
danger of his being snowed in than of a fox's."Before the meal was over, the wind, snow-laden, was moaning about the
house.With every hour the gale increased in intensity.Early in the
afternoon the men with the two teams drove to the barn.Amy could just
see their white, obscure figures through the blinding snow, Even old Mr.Burt come up in de mawnin'
an' stirred us all up right smart, slashed down a tree hisself to show a
new gawky hand dat's cuttin' by de cord how to 'arn his salt; den he put
out wid his rafle in a bee-line toward de riber.Dat's de last we seed ob
him;" and Abram went stolidly on to unhitch and care for his horses.Clifford and his two elder sons returned to the house with traces of
anxiety on their faces, while Mrs.Clifford was so worried that,
supported by Amy, she made an unusual effort, and met them at the door."Don't be disturbed, mother," said Webb, confidently."Burt and I have
often been caught in snowstorms, but never had any difficulty in finding
our way.Burt will soon appear, or, if he doesn't, it will be because he
has stopped to recount to Dr.Indeed, they all tried to reassure her, but, with woman's quick instinct
where her affections are concerned, she read what was passing in their
minds.Her husband led her back to her couch, where she lay with her
large dark eyes full of trouble, while her lips often moved in prayer.The thought of her youngest and darling son far off and alone among those
cloud-capped and storm-beaten mountains was terrible to her.Another hour passed, and still the absent youth did not return.Leonard,
his father, and Amy, often went to the hall window and looked out.The
storm so enhanced the early gloom of the winter afternoon that the
outbuildings, although so near, loomed out only as shadows.John went back to the garden.The wind was
growing almost fierce in its violence.Webb had so long kept up his
pretence of reading that Amy began in her thoughts to resent his seeming
indifference as cold-blooded.At last he laid down his book, and went
quietly away.She followed him, for it seemed to her that something ought
to be done, and that he was the one to do it.She found him in an upper
chamber, standing by an open window that faced the mountains.Joining
him, she was appalled by the roar of the wind as it swept down from the
wooded heights."Oh, Webb," she exclaimed--he started at her words and presence, and
quickly closed the window--"ought not something to be done?The bare
thought that Burt is lost in this awful gloom fills me with horror.The
sound of that wind was like the roar of the ocean in a storm we had.How
can he see in such blinding snow?How could he breast this gale if he
were weary?"He was silent a moment, looking with contracted brows at the gloomy
scene.At last he began, as if reassuring himself as well as the agitated
girl at his side:

"Burt, you must remember, has been brought up in this region.He knows
the mountains well, and--"

"Oh, Webb, you take this matter too coolly," interrupted Amy, impulsively."Something tells me that Burt is in danger;" and in her deep solicitude she
put her hand on his arm.She noticed that it trembled, and that he still
bent the same contracted brow toward the region where his brother must be
if her fears were true."Yes," he said, quietly, "I take it coolly.You may be right, and there may be need of prompt, wise action.If so, a
man will need the full control of all his wits.I will not, however, give
up my hope--my almost belief--that he is at Dr.I shall
satisfy myself at once.Try not to show your fears to father and mother,
that's a brave girl."He was speaking hurriedly now as they were descending the stairs.He
found his father in the hall, much disturbed, and querying with his
eldest son as to the advisability of taking some steps immediately.Leonard, although evidently growing anxious, still urged that Burt, with
his knowledge and experience as a sportsman, would not permit himself to
be caught in such a storm."He surely must be at the house of Dr.Marvin or some other neighbor on
the mountain road.""I also think he is at the doctor's, but shall see," Webb remarked,
quietly, as he drew on his overcoat."I don't think he's there; I don't think he is at any neighbor's house,"
cried Mrs.Clifford, who, to the surprise of all, had made her way to the
hall unaided."Burt is thoughtless about little things, but he would not
leave me in suspense on such a night as this.""Mother, I promise you Burt shall soon be here safe and sound;" and Webb
in his shaggy coat and furs went hastily out, followed by Leonard.A few
moments later the dusky outlines of a man and a galloping horse appeared
to Amy for a moment, and then vanished toward the road.It was some time before Leonard returned, for Webb had said: "If Burt is
not at the doctor's, we must go and look for him.Had you not better have
the strongest wood-sled ready?Having admitted the possibility of danger, Leonard acted promptly.With
Abram's help a pair of stout horses were soon attached to the sled, which
was stored with blankets, shovels to clear away drifts, etc.Webb soon came galloping back, followed a few moments later by the
doctor, but there were no tidings of Burt.Clifford would become deeply agitated, but was
mistaken.She lay on her couch with closed eyes, but her lips moved
almost continuously.She had gone to Him whose throne is beyond all
storms.Clifford was with difficulty restrained from joining his sons in the
search.The old habit of resolute action returned upon him, but Webb
settled the question by saying, in a tone almost stern in its authority,
"Father, you _must_ remain with mother."Amy had no further reason to complain that Webb took the matter too
coolly.He was all action, but his movements were as deft as they were
quick.In the basket which Maggie had furnished with brandy and food he
placed the conch-shell used to summon Abram to his meals.Then, taking
down a double-barrelled breech-loading gun, he filled his pocket with
cartridges.Amy asked, with white lips, for, as he seemed the
natural leader, she hovered near him."If we do not find him at one of the houses well up on the mountain, as I
hope we shall, I shall fire repeatedly in our search.The reports would
be heard further than any other sound, and he might answer with his
rifle."Leonard now entered with the doctor, who said, "All ready; we have
stored the sledge with abundant material for fires, and if Burt has
met with an accident, I am prepared to do all that can be done under
the circumstances.""All ready," responded Webb, again putting on his coat and fur cap.Amy sprang to his side and tied the cap securely down with her scarf."Forgive me," she whispered, "for saying that you took Bart's danger
coolly.I now see that you are thinking of Burt only.""Of you also, little sister, and I shall be the stronger for such
thoughts.We shall find Burt, and all come home
hungry as wolves."May the blessing of Him who came to seek and save the lost go with you!"A moment later they dashed away, followed by Burt's hound and the
watch-dog, and the darkness and storm hid them from sight.Oh, the heavy cross of watching and waiting!Many claim that woman is not
the equal of man because she must watch and wait in so many of the dread
emergencies of life, forgetting that it is infinitely easier to act, to
face the wildest storm that sweeps the sky or the deadliest hail crashing
from cannons' mouths, than to sit down in sickening suspense waiting for
the blow to fall.The man's duty requires chiefly the courage which he
shares with the greater part of the brute creation, and only as he adds
woman's patience, fortitude, and endurance does he become heroic.Nothing
but his faith in God and his life-long habit of submission to his will
kept Mr.Clifford from chafing like a caged lion in his enforced
inaction.Clifford, her mother's heart yearning after her youngest
and darling boy with an infinite tenderness, alone was calm.Amy's young heart was oppressed by an unspeakable dread.It was partly
due to the fear and foreboding of a child to whom the mountains were a
Siberia-like wilderness in their awful obscurity, and still more the
result of knowledge of the sorrow that death involves.The bare possibility
that the light-hearted, ever-active Burt, who sometimes perplexed her with
more than fraternal devotion, was lying white and still beneath the
drifting snow, or even wandering helplessly in the blinding gale, was so
terrible that it blanched her cheek, and made her lips tremble when she
tried to speak.She felt that she had been a little brusque to him at
times, and now she reproached herself in remorseful compunction, and with
the abandonment of a child to her present overwrought condition, felt that
she could never refuse him anything should his blue eyes turn pleadingly to
her again.At first she did not give way, but was sustained, like Maggie,
by the bustle of preparation for the return, and in answering the
innumerable questions of Johnnie and Alf.Webb's assurance to his mother
that he would bring Burt back safe and sound was her chief hope.From the
first moment of greeting he had inspired her with a confidence that had
steadily increased, and from the time that he had admitted the possibility
of this awful emergency he had acted so resolutely and wisely as to
convince her that all that man could do would be done.She did not think of
explaining to herself why her hope centred more in him than in all the
others engaged in the search, or why she was more solicitous about him in
the hardships and perils that the expedition involved, and yet Webb shared
her thoughts almost equally with Burt.If the latter were reached, Webb
would be the rescuer, but her sickening dread was that in the black night
and howling storm he could not be found.As the rescuing party pushed their way up the mountain with difficulty they
became more and more exposed to the northeast gale, and felt with
increasing dread how great was the peril to which Burt must be exposed had
he not found refuge in some of the dwellings nearer to the scene of his
sport.The roar of the gale up the rugged defile was perfectly terrific,
and the snow caught up from the overhanging ledges was often driven into
their faces with blinding force.They could do little better than give the
horses their heads, and the poor brutes floundered slowly through the
drifts.The snow had deepened incredibly fast, and the fierce wind piled it
up so fantastically in every sheltered place that they were often in danger
of upsetting, and more than once had to spring out with their shovels.At
last, after an hour of toil, they reached the first summit, but no tidings
could be obtained of Burt from the people residing in the vicinity.They
therefore pushed on toward the gloomy wastes beyond, and before long left
behind them the last dwelling and the last chance that he had found shelter
before night set in.Two stalwart men had joined them in the search,
however, and formed a welcome re-inforcement.With terrible forebodings
they pressed forward, Webb firing his breech-loader rapidly, and the rest
making what noise they could, but the gale swept away these feeble sounds,
and merged them almost instantly in the roar of the tempest.It was their
natural belief that in attempting to reach home Burt would first try to
gain the West Point road that crossed the mountains, for here would be a
pathway that the snow could not obliterate, and also his best chance of
meeting a rescuing party.It was therefore their purpose to push on until
the southern <DW72> of Cro' Nest was reached, but they became so chilled and
despondent over their seemingly impossible task that they stopped on an
eminence near a rank of wood.They knew that the outlook commanded a wide
view to the south and north, and that if Burt were cowering somewhere in
that region, it would be a good point from which to attract his attention."I move that we make a fire here," said Leonard."Abram is half-frozen,
we are all chilled to the bone, and the horses need rest.I think, too,
that a fire can be seen further than any sound can be heard."The instinct of self-preservation caused them all to accede, and,
moreover, they must keep up themselves in order to accomplish anything.They soon had a roaring blaze under the partial shield of a rock, while
at the same time the flames rose so high as to be seen on both sides of
the ridge as far as the storm permitted.The horses were sheltered as
well as possible, and heavily blanketed.As the men thawed out their
benumbed forms, Webb exclaimed, "Great God!what chance has Burt in such
a storm?The others shook their heads gloomily, but answered nothing."There is no use in disguising the truth," said the doctor, slowly."If
Burt's alive, he must have a fire.But
how can one see anything through this swirl of snow, that is almost as
thick in the air as on the ground?"To their great joy the storm soon began to abate, and the wind to blow in
gusts.They clambered to the highest point near them, and peered eagerly
for some glimmer of light; but only a dim, wild scene, that quickly
shaded off into utter obscurity, was around them.The snowflakes were
growing larger, however, and were no longer swept with a cutting slant
into their faces.cried Webb, "I believe the gale is nearly blown out.I shall
follow this ridge toward the river as far as I can.""I'll go with you," said he doctor, promptly."No," said Webb; "it will be your turn next.It won't do for us all to
get worn out together.I'll go cautiously; and with this ridge as guide,
and the fire, I can't lose my way.I'll take one of the dogs, and fire my
gun about every ten minutes.If I fire twice in succession, follow me;
meanwhile give a blast on the conch every few moments;" and with these
words he speedily disappeared.The doctor and Leonard returned to the fire, and watched the great flakes
fall hissing into the flames.Hearing of Webb's expedition, the two
neighbors who had recently joined them pushed on up the road, shouting
and blowing the conch-shell as often as they deemed it necessary.Their
signal also was to be two blasts should they meet with any success.Leonard and the doctor were a _corps de reserve_.The wind soon ceased
altogether, and a stillness that was almost oppressive took the place of
the thunder of the gale.They threw themselves down to rest, and Leonard
observed with a groan how soon his form grew white."Oh, doctor," he said
in a tone of anguish, "can it be that we shall never find Burt till the
snow melts?""Do not take so gloomy a view," was the reply."Burt must have been able
to make a fire, and now that the wind has ceased we can attract his
attention."Webb's gun was heard from time to time, the sounds growing steadily
fainter.At last, far away to the east, came two reports in quick
succession.The two men started up, and with the aid of lanterns followed
Webb's trail, Abram bringing up the rear with an axe and blankets.Sometimes up to his waist in snow, sometimes springing from rock to rock
that the wind had swept almost bare, Webb had toiled on along the broken
ridge, his face scratched and bleeding from the shaggy, stunted trees
that it was too dark to avoid; but he thought not of such trifles, and
seemed endowed with a strength ten times his own.Every few moments he
would stop, listen, and peer about him on every side.Finally, after a
rather long upward climb, he knew he had reached a rock of some altitude.The echoes soon died away, and there was no sound
except the low tinkle of the snowflakes through the bushes.He was just
about to push on, when, far down to the right and south of him, he
thought he saw a gleam of light.He looked long and eagerly, but in vain.He passed over to that side of the ridge, and fired again; but there was
no response--nothing but the dim, ghostly snow on every side.Concluding
that it had been but a trick of the imagination, he was about to give up
the hope that had thrilled his heart, when feebly but unmistakably a ray
of light shot up, wavered, and disappeared.At the same moment his dog
gave a loud bark, and plunged down the ridge.A moment sufficed to give
the preconcerted signal, and almost at the risk of life and limb Webb
rushed down the precipitous <DW72>.He had not gone very far before he
heard a long, piteous howl that chilled his very soul with dread.He
struggled forward desperately, and, turning the angle of a rock, saw a
dying fire, and beside it a human form merely outlined through the snow.As the dog was again raising one of his ill-omened howls, Webb stopped
him savagely, and sprang to the prostrate figure, whose face was buried
in its arm.Webb placed a hand that trembled like an aspen over his
brother's heart, and with a loud cry of joy felt its regular beat.Burt
had as yet only succumbed to sleep, which in such cases is fatal when no
help interposes.Webb again fired twice to guide the rescuing party, and
then with some difficulty caused Burt to swallow a little brandy.He next
began to chafe his wrists with the spirits, to shake him, and to shout in
his ear.Slowly Burt shook off his fatal lethargy, and by the time the
rest of the party reached him, was conscious.he exclaimed, "did I go to sleep?I vowed I would not a
hundred times.Nor would I if I could have moved around; but I've
sprained my ankle, and can't walk."With infinite difficulty, but with hearts light and grateful, they
carried him on an improvised stretcher to the sled.Bart explained that
he had been lured further and further away by a large eagle that had kept
just out of range, and in his excitement he had at first paid no
attention to the storm.Finally its increasing fury and the memory of his
distance from home had brought him to his senses, and he had struck out
for the West Point road.Still he had no fears or misgivings, but while
climbing the <DW72> on which he was found, he slipped, fell, and in trying
to save himself came down with his whole weight on a loose stone, and
sprained his left ankle.He tried to crawl and hobble forward, and for a
time gave way to something like panic.He soon found that he was using up
his strength, and that he would perish with the cold before he could make
half a mile.He then crawled under the sheltering ledge where Webb
discovered him, and by the aid of his good woodcraft soon had a fire, for
it was his fortune to have some matches.A dead and partially decayed
tree, a knife strong enough to cut the saplings when bent over, supplied
him with fuel.Finally the drowsiness which long exposure to cold induces
began to oppress him.He fought against it desperately for a time, but,
as events proved, was overpowered."We have all had a hand at it," was the quiet reply."I couldn't have
done anything alone."Wrapped up beyond the possibility of further danger from the cold, and
roused from time to time, Burt was carried homeward as fast as the drifts
permitted, the horses' bells now chiming musically in the still air.*       *       *       *       *

As hour after hour passed and there was nothing left to do, Amy took
Johnnie on her lap, and they rocked back and forth and cried together.Soon the heavy lids closed over the little girl's eyes, and shut off the
tears.Alf had already coiled up on a lounge and sobbed himself to sleep.Maggie took up the little girl, laid her down beside him, and covered
them well from the draughts that the furious gale drove through every
crack and cranny of the old house, glad that they had found a happy
oblivion.Amy then crept to a footstool at Mrs.Clifford's side--the
place where she had so often seen the youth whom the storm she now almost
began to believe had swept from them forever--and she bowed her head on
the old lady's thin hand and sobbed bitterly."Don't give way so, darling," said the mother, as her other hand stroked
the brown hair.We have prayed, and we
now feel that he will do what is best.""It will come in time--when long years have taught you his goodness."She slowly wiped her eyes, and stole a glance at Mr.His
earlier half-desperate restlessness had passed away, and he sat quietly
in his chair gazing into the fire, occasionally wiping a tear from his
eyes, and again looking upward with an expression of sublime submission.Soon, as if conscious of her wondering observation, he said, "Come to me,
Amy."She stood beside him, and he drew her close as he continued:

"My child, one of the hardest lessons we can learn in this world is to
say, 'Not my will, but Thine be done.'I have lived fourscore years, and
yet I could not say it at first; but now" (with a calm glance heavenward)
"I can say, 'My Father, thy will be done.'If he takes Burt, he has given
us you;" and he kissed her so tenderly that she bowed her head upon his
shoulder, and said, brokenly:

"You are my father in very truth."There was a Presence in the room that
filled her with awe, and yet banished her former overwhelming dread and
grief.They watched and waited; there was no sound in the room except the soft
crackle of the fire, and Amy thought deeply on the noble example before
her of calm, trustful waiting.At last she became conscious that the
house was growing strangely still; the faint tick of the great clock on
the landing of the stairs struck her ear; the rush and roar of the wind
had ceased.Bewildered, she rose softly and went to Maggie's room, and
found that the tired mother in watching over her children had fallen
asleep in her chair.She lifted a curtain, and could scarcely believe her
eyes when she saw that the trees that had been writhing and moaning in
the gale now stood white and spectral as the lamp-light fell upon them.It seemed as if the calm that had fallen upon
her spirit had extended to nature; that the storm had hushed its rude
clamor even while it continued.From the window she watched the white
flakes flutter through the light she knew not how long: the old clock
chimed out midnight, and then, faint and far away, she thought she heard
the sleigh-bells.With swift, silent tread, she rushed to a side door and
threw it open.Yes, clear and distinct she now heard them on the mountain
road.With a low cry she returned and wakened Maggie, then flew to the
old people, and, with a voice that she tried in vain to steady, said,
"They are coming."Clifford started up, and was about to rush from the room, but paused
a moment irresolutely, then returned, sat down by his wife, and put his
arm around her.The invalid had grown
faint and white, but his touch and presence were the cordials she needed.Amy fled back to the side door, and the sled soon appeared.There was no
light at this entrance, and she was unobserved.She saw them begin to
lift some one out, and she dashed through an intervening drift nearly to
her waist.Webb felt a hand close on his arm with a grip that he long
remembered.she cried, in a tone of agonizing inquiry."Heigh-ho, Amy," said the much-muffled figure that they were taking from
the sled; "I'm all right."In strong reaction, the girl would have fallen, had not Webb supported
her.He felt that she trembled and clung almost helplessly to him."Why, Amy," he said, gently, "you will take your death out here in the
cold and snow"; and leaving the others to care for Burt, he lifted her in
his arms and carried her in."Thank God, he's safe," she murmured.There,
I'm better now," she said, hastily, and with a swift color coming into
her pale cheeks, as they reached the door."You must not expose yourself so again, sister Amy.""I thought--I thought when you began to lift Burt out--" But she could
not finish the sentence.Perhaps there is no joy like that which fills loving hearts when the lost
is found.It is so pure and exalted that it is one of the ecstasies of
heaven.It would be hard to describe how the old house waked up with its
sudden accession of life--life that was so warm and vivid against the
background of the shadow of death.There were murmured thanksgivings as
feet hurried to and fro, and an opening fire of questions, which Maggie
checked by saying:

"Possess your souls in patience.Burt's safe--that's enough to know until
he is cared for, and my half-famished husband and the rest get their
supper.Pretty soon we can all sit down, for I want a chance to hear
too.""And no one has a better right, Maggie," said her husband, chafing his
hands over the fire."After what we've seen to-night, this place is the
very abode of comfort, and you its presiding genius;" and Leonard beamed
and thawed until the air grew tropical around him.Clifford's request (for it was felt that it was not best to cross
the invalid), Burt, in the rocking-chair wherein he had been placed, was
carried to her room, and received a greeting from his parents that
brought tears to the young fellow's eyes.Marvin soon did all within
his power at that stage for the sprained ankle and frost-bitten fingers,
the mother advising, and feeling that she was still caring for her boy as
she had done a dozen years before.Then Burt was carried back to the
dining-room, where all were soon gathered.The table groaned under
Maggie's bountiful provision, and lamp-light and fire-light revealed a
group upon which fell the richer light of a great joy.Burt was ravenously hungry, but the doctor put him on limited diet,
remarking, "You can soon make up for lost time."He and Leonard, however,
made such havoc that Amy pretended to be aghast; but she soon noted that
Webb ate sparingly, that his face was not only scratched and torn, but
almost haggard, and that he was unusually quiet.When all were helped, and Maggie had a chance to sit down, she
said:

"Now tell us about it.We just heard enough when you first arrived to
curdle our blood.How in the world, Burt, did you allow yourself to get
caught in such a storm?""If it had not been for this confounded sprain I should have come out all
right;" and then followed the details with which the reader is acquainted,
although little could be got out of Webb."The upshot of it all is," said Leonard, as he beamed upon the party with
ineffable content, "between mother's praying and Webb's looking, Burt is
here, not much the worse for his eagle hunt."They would not hear of the doctor's departure, and very soon afterward
old Mr.Clifford gathered them around the family altar in a thanksgiving
prayer that moistened every eye.Then all prepared for the rest so sorely needed.As Webb went to the hall
to hang up his gun, Amy saw that he staggered in his almost mortal
weariness, and she followed him."There are your colors, Amy," he said, laughingly, taking her scarf from
an inner pocket."I wore it till an envious scrub-oak tore it off.It was
of very great help to me--the scarf, not the oak.""Webb," she said, earnestly, "you can't disguise the truth from me by any
such light words.I've been watching
you ever since your return.You are ill--you have gone beyond your
strength, and in addition to it all I let you carry me in."It's wonderfully nice to have a little sister to worry about a fellow.""But can't I do something for you?You've thought about everybody, and no
one thinks for you.""_You_ have, and so have the rest, as far as there was occasion.Let me
tell you how wan and weary you look.Oh, Amy, our home is so much more to
us since you came!""What would our home be to us to-night, Webb, were it not for you!And I
said you took Burt's danger too coolly.How I have reproached myself for
those words.you did not resent them; and you saved
Burt;" and she impulsively put her arm around his neck and kissed him,
then fled to her room.The philosophical Webb might have had much to think about that night had
he been in an analytical mood, for by some magic his sense of utter
weariness was marvellously relieved.With a low laugh, he thought,

"I'd be tempted to cross the mountains again for such a reward."CHAPTER XIV

HINTS OF SPRING


When Amy awoke on the following morning she was almost dazzled, so
brilliant was the light that flooded the room.Long, quiet sleep and the
elasticity of youth had banished all depression from mind and body, and
she sprang eagerly to the window that she might see the effects of the
storm, expecting to witness its ravages on every side.Imagine her wonder
and delight when, instead of widespread wreck and ruin, a scene of
indescribable beauty met her eyes!The snow had draped all things in
white.The trees that had seemed so gaunt and skeleton-like as they
writhed and moaned in the gale were now clothed with a beauty surpassing
that of their summer foliage, for every branch, even to the smallest
twig, had been incased in the downy flakes.The evergreens looked like
old-time gallants well powdered for a festival.The shrubbery of the
garden was scarcely more than mounds of snow.The fences had almost
disappeared; while away as far as the eye could reach all was sparkling
whiteness.Nature was like a bride adorned for her nuptials.Under the
earlier influences of the gale the snow had drifted here and there,
making the undulations of her robe, and under the cloudless sun every
crystal glittered, as if over all had been flung a profusion of diamond
dust.Nor did she seem a cold, pallid bride without heart or gladness.Her breath was warm and sweet, and full of an indefinable suggestion of
spring.She seemed to stand radiant in maidenly purity and loveliness,
watching in almost breathless expectation the rising of the sun above the
eastern mountains.A happy group gathered at the breakfast-table that morning.Best of mind
and thankfulness of heart had conduced to refreshing repose, and the
brightness of the new day was reflected in every face.Burt's ankle was
painful, but this was a slight matter in contrast with what might have
been his fate.He had insisted on being dressed and brought to the lounge
in the breakfast-room.Webb seemed wonderfully restored, and Amy thought
he looked almost handsome in his unwonted animation, in spite of the
honorable scars that marked his face.Marvin exclaimed, exultingly:

"Miss Amy, you can begin the study of ornithology at once.There are
bluebirds all about the house, and you have no idea what exquisite bits
of color they are against the snow on this bright morning.After
breakfast you must go out and greet these first arrivals from the South.""Yes, Amy," put in Leonard, laughing, "it's a lovely morning for a
stroll.The snow is only two feet deep, and drifted in many places higher
than your head.The 'beautiful snow' brings us plenty of prose in the
form of back-aching work with our shovels.""No matter," said Webb; "it has also brought us warmth, exquisitely pure
air, and a splendid covering for grass and grain that will be apt to last
well into the spring.Anything rather than mud and the alternate freezing
and thawing that are as provoking as a capricious friend.""Why, Webb, what a burst of sentiment!""Doctor, the bluebirds seem to come like the south wind that Leonard says
is blowing this morning," Mrs.and how have they reached us after such a storm?""I imagine that those we hear this morning have been with us all winter,
or they may have arrived before the storm.I scarcely remember a winter
when I have not seen some around, and their instinct guides them where to
find shelter.When the weather is very cold they are comparatively
silent, but even a January thaw will make them tuneful.They are also
migrants, and have been coming northward for a week or two past, and this
accounts for the numbers this morning.they must have
had a hard time of it last night, wherever they were.""Oh, I do wish I could make them know how glad I'd be to take them in and
keep them warm every cold night!""They have a better mother than even you could be," said the doctor,
nodding at the little girl."Indeed they have, and all the other birds also, and this mother takes
care of them the year round--Mother Nature, that's her name.Your heart
may be big enough, but your house would not begin to hold all the
bluebirds, so Mother Nature tells the greater part of them to go where
it's warm about the 1st of December, and she finds them winter homes all
the way from Virginia to Florida.Then toward spring she whispers when it
is safe to come back, and if you want to see how she can take care of
those that are here even during such a storm as that of last night,
bundle up and come out on the sunny back piazza."There all the household soon after assembled, the men armed with shovels
to aid in the path-making in which Abram was already engaged.Burt was
placed in a rocking-chair by a window that he might enjoy the prospect
also.A charming winter outlook it was, brilliant with light and gemmed
with innumerable crystals.To Amy's delight, she heard for the first time
the soft, down-like notes of the bluebird.At first they seemed like mere
"wandering voices in the air," sweet, plaintive, and delicate as the
wind-swayed anemone.Then came a soft rustle of wings, and a bird darted
downward, probably from the eaves, but seemingly it was a bit of the sky
that had taken form and substance.He flew past her and dislodged a
miniature avalanche from the spray on which he alighted.The little
creature sat still a moment, then lifted and stretched one wing by an odd
coquettish movement while it uttered its low musical warble."Why," exclaimed Amy, "he is almost the counterpart of our robin-redbreast
of England!"Marvin, "he resembles your English redbreast closely
both in appearance and habits, and our New England forefathers called him
the 'blue robin.'To my taste the bluebird is the superior of the two,
for what he lacks in stronger and more varied song he makes up in softer,
sweeter notes.You have no blue birds of any
kind in England, Amy.It seems to require our deeper-tinted skies to
produce them.You can tell her by the lighter
blue of her plumage, and the tinge of brown on her head and back.She is
a cold, coy beauty, even as a wife; but how gallant is her azure-coated
beau!Flirt away, my little chap, and make the most of your courting and
honeymoon.You will soon have family cares enough to discourage anybody
but a bluebird;" and the doctor looked at his favorites with an exulting
affection that caused a general laugh."I shall give our little friends something better than compliments," said
Mr.Clifford, obeying his hospitable instincts, and he waded through the
snow to the sunny side of an evergreen, and there cleared a space until
the ground was bare.Then he scattered over this little plot an abundance
of bread-crumbs and hay seed, and they all soon had the pleasure of
seeing half a dozen little bobbing heads at breakfast.Johnnie and Alf,
who on account of the deep snow did not go to school, were unwearied in
watching the lovely little pensioners on their grandfather's bounty--not
pensioners either, for, as the old man said, "They pay their way with
notes that I am always glad to accept."The work of path-making and shovelling snow from the doors and roofs of
the out-buildings went on vigorously all the morning.Abram also attached
the farm horses to the heavy snow-plow, to which he added his weight, and
a broad, track-like furrow was made from the house to the road, and then
for a mile or more each way upon the street, for the benefit of the
neighbors.Before the day was very far advanced, the south wind, which
had been a scarcely perceptible breath, freshened, and between the busy
shovels and the swaying branches the air was full of glittering crystals.The bride-like world was throwing off her ornaments and preparing for the
prose of every-day life; and yet she did so in a cheerful, lightsome
mood.The sunny eaves dropped a profusion of gems from the melting snow.There was a tinkle of water in the pipes leading to the cistern.From the
cackle in the barn-yard it appeared that the hens had resolved on
unwonted industry, and were receiving applause from the oft-crowing
chanticleers.The horses, led out to drink, were in exuberant spirits,
and appeared to find a child's delight in kicking up the snow.The cows
came briskly from their stalls to the space cleared for them, and were
soon ruminating in placid content.What though the snow covered the
ground deeper than at any time during the winter, the subtile spirit of
spring was recognized and welcomed not only by man, but also by the lower
creation!After putting Burt in a fair way of recovery, Dr.Marvin, armed with a
shovel to burrow his way through the heavier drifts, drove homeward.Alf
floundered off to his traps, and returned exultant with two rabbits.Amy
was soon busy sketching them previous to their transformation into a
pot-pie, Burt looking on with a deeper interest in the artist than in her
art, although he had already learned that she had not a little skill with
her pencil.Indeed, Burt promised to become quite reconciled to his part of
invalid, in spite of protestations to the contrary; and his inclination to
think that Amy's companionship would be an antidote for every ill of life
was increasing rapidly, in accordance with his hasty temperament, which
arrived at conclusions long before others had begun to consider the steps
leading to them.Amy was still more a child than a woman; but a girl must be young indeed
who does not recognize an admirer, especially so transparent a one as
Burt would ever be.His ardent glances and compliments both amused and
annoyed her.From his brothers she had obtained several hints of his
previous and diversified gallantries, and was not at all assured that
those in the future might not be equally varied.She did not doubt the
sincerity of his homage, however; and since she had found it so easy to
love him as a brother, it did not seem impossible that she should learn
to regard him in another light, if all thought it best, and he "would
only be sensible and understand that she did not wish to think about such
things for years to come."Thus it may be seen that in one respect her
heart was not much more advanced than that of little Johnnie.She
expected to be married some time or other, and supposed it might as well
be to Burt as to another, if their friends so desired it; but she was for
putting off submission to woman's natural lot as long as possible.Possessing much tact, she was able in a great measure to repress the
young fellow's demonstrativeness, and maintain their brotherly and
sisterly relations; but it cost her effort, and sometimes she left his
society flurried and wearied.With Webb she enjoyed perfect rest and a
pleasing content.He was so quiet and strong that his very presence
seemed to soothe her jarring nerves.He appeared to understand her, to
have the power to make much that interested her more interesting, while
upon her little feminine mysteries of needle and fancy work he looked
with an admiring helplessness, as if she were more unapproachable in her
sphere than he could ever be in his, with all his scientific facts and
theories.Women like this tribute to their womanly ways from the sterner
sex.Maggie's wifehood was made happy by it, for by a hundred little
things she knew that the great, stalwart Leonard would be lost without
her.Moreover, by his rescue of Burt, Webb had won a higher place in
Amy's esteem.He had shown the prompt energy and courage which satisfy
woman's ideal of manhood, and assure her of protection.Amy did not
analyze her feelings or consciously assure herself of all this.She only
felt that Webb was restful, and would give her a sense of safety, no
matter what happened.CHAPTER XV

NATURE'S BUILDING MATERIALS


Some days after Burt's adventure, Dr.Marvin made his professional call
in the evening.Alvord, Squire Bartley, and the minister also
happened in, and all were soon chatting around Mr.Clifford's ruddy
hearth.The pastor of this country parish was a sensible man, who, if he
did not electrify his flock of a Sunday morning, honestly tried to guide
it along safe paths, and led those whom he asked to follow.His power lay
chiefly in the homes of his people, where his genial presence was ever
welcomed.He did not regard those to whom he ministered as so many souls
and subjects of theological dogma, but as flesh-and-blood men, women, and
children, with complex interests and relations; and the heartiness of his
laugh over a joke, often his own, and the havoc that he made in the
dishes of nuts and apples, proved that he had plenty of good healthful
blood himself.Although his hair was touched with frost, and he had never
received any degree except his simple A.M., although the prospect of a
metropolitan pulpit had grown remote indeed, he seemed the picture of
content as he pared his apple and joined in the neighborly talk.Squire Bartley had a growing sense of shortcoming in his farming
operations.Notwithstanding his many acres, he felt himself growing
"land-poor," as country people phrase it.He was not a reader, and looked
with undisguised suspicion on book-farming.As for the agricultural
journals, he said "they were full of new-fangled notions, and were kept
up by people who liked to see their names in print."Nevertheless, he was
compelled to admit that the Cliffords, who kept abreast of the age,
obtained better crops, and made their business pay far better than he
did, and he was inclined to turn his neighborly calls into thrifty use by
questioning Leonard and Webb concerning their methods and management.Therefore he remarked to Leonard: "Do you find that you can keep your
land in good condition by rotation of crops?Folks say this will do it,
but I find some of our upland is getting mighty thin, and crops uncertain.""What is your idea of rotation, squire?""Why, not growin' the same crop too often on the same ground."For the majority of soils the following
rotation has been found most beneficial: corn and potatoes, which
thoroughly subdue the sod the first year; root crops, as far as we grow
them, and oats the second; then wheat or rye, seeded at the same time
with clover or grass of some kind.We always try to plow our sod land in
the fall, for in the intervening time before planting the sod partially
decays, the land is sweetened and pulverized by the action of frost, and
a good many injurious insects are killed also.But all rules need
modification, and we try to study the nature of our various soils, and
treat them accordingly".have a chemist prescribe for 'em like a doctor?"Walters, the rich city chap who bought Roger's worn-out
farm, tried that to his heart's content, and mine too.He had a little of
the dirt of each part of his farm analyzed, you know, and then he sent to
New York for his phosphates, his potashes, his muriates, and his
compound-super-universal panacea vegetates, and with all these bad-smelling
mixtures--his barn was like a big agricultural drug-store--he was going to
put into his skinned land just the elements lacking.In short, he gave his
soil a big dose of powders, and we all know the result.If he had given his
farm a pinch of snuff better crops ought to have been sneezed.No chemicals
and land doctors for me, thank you.no reflections on
your calling, but doctorin' land don't seem profitable for those who pay
for the medicine."They all laughed except Webb, who seemed nettled, but who quietly said,
"Squire, will you please tell us what your house is made of?""Well, when passing one day, I saw a fine stalk of corn in one of your
fields.Will you also tell us what that was made of?It must have
weighed, with the ears upon it, several pounds, and it was all of six
feet high."Why, it grew," said the squire, sententiously."That utterance was worthy of Solomon," remarked Dr."It grew," continued Webb, "because it found the needed material at hand.I do not see how Nature can build a well-eared stalk of corn without
proper material any more than you could have built your house without
lumber.Suppose we have a soil in which the elements that make a crop of
corn do not exist, or are present in a very deficient degree, what course
is left for us but to supply what is lacking?Walters did not
do this in the right way, is no reason why we should do nothing.If soil
does not contain the ingredients of a crop, we must put them there, or
our labor goes for nothing"."Well, of course there's no gettin' around that; but yard manure is all I
want.It's like a square meal to a man, and not a bit of powder on his
tongue.""No one wants anything better than barn-yard manure for most purposes,
for it contains nearly all the elements needed by growing plants, and its
mechanical action is most beneficial to the soil.But how many acres will
you be able to cover with this fertilizer this spring?""That's just the rub," the squire answered."We use all we have, and when
I can pick it up cheap I buy some; but one can't cover a whole farm with
it, and so in spite of you some fields get all run out.""I don't think there's any need of their running out," said Leonard,
emphatically."I agree with Webb in one thing, if I can't follow him in
all of his scientific theories--we have both decided never to let a
field grow poor, any more than we would permit a horse or cow to so lose
in flesh as to be nearly useless; therefore we not only buy fertilizers
liberally, but use all the skill and care within our power to increase
them.Barn-yard manure can be doubled in bulk and almost doubled in value
by composting with the right materials.We make the most of our peat
swamps, fallen leaves, and rubbish in general.Enough goes to waste on
many farms every year to keep several acres in good heart.But, as you
say, we cannot begin to procure enough to go over all the land from which
we are taking crops of some kind; therefore we maintain a rotation which
is adapted to our various soils, and every now and then plow under a
heavy green crop of clover, buckwheat, or rye.A green crop plowed under
is my great stand-by.""I plowed under a crop of buckwheat once," said the squire, discontentedly,
"and I didn't see much good from it, except that the ground was light and
mellow afterward.""That, at least, was a gain," Leonard continued; "but I can tell you why
your ground was not much benefited, and perhaps injured.You scarcely
plowed under a green crop, for I remember that the grain in your
buckwheat straw was partly ripe.It is the forming seed or grain that
takes the substance out of land.You should have plowed the buckwheat
under just as it was coming into blossom.Up to that time the chief
growth had been derived from the air, and there had been very little
drain upon the soil."exclaimed the squire, incredulously, "I didn't know the air was
so nourishing."Webb had been showing increasing signs of disquietude during the last few
moments, and now said, with some emphasis: "It seems to me, squire, that
there is not much hope of our farming successfully unless we do know
something of the materials that make our crops, and the conditions under
which they grow.When you built your house you did not employ a man who
had only a vague idea of how it was to be constructed, and what it was to
be built of.Before your house was finished you had used lumber as your
chief material, but you also employed brick, stone, lime, sand, nails,
etc.If we examine a house, we find all these materials.If we wish to
build another house, we know we must use them in their proper proportions.Now it is just as much a matter of fact, and is just as capable of proof,
that a plant of any kind is built up on a regular plan, and from
well-defined materials, as that a house is so built.The materials in
various houses differ just as the elements in different kinds of plants
vary.A man can decide what he will build of; Nature has decided forever
what she will build of.She will construct a stalk of corn or wheat with
its grain out of essentially the same materials to the end of time.Now
suppose one or more of these necessary ingredients is limited in the soil,
or has been taken from it by a succession of crops, what rational hope can
we have for a good crop unless we place the absent material in the ground,
and also put it there in a form suitable for the use of the plant?""What you say sounds plausible enough," answered the squire, scratching
his head with the worried, perplexed air of a man convinced against his
will."How was it, then, that Walters made such a mess of it?He had his
soil analyzed by a land doctor, and boasted that he was going to put into
it just what was lacking.His soil may not be lacking now, but his crops
are.""It is possible that there are quacks among land doctors, as you call
them, as well as among doctors of medicine", remarked Dr."Or doctors of theology," added the minister."I looked into the Walters experiment somewhat carefully," Webb resumed,
"and the causes of his failure were apparent to any one who has given a
little study to the nature of soils and plant food.The ground is sour and cold from stagnant water beneath
the surface, and the plant food which Nature originally placed in it is
inert and in no condition to be used.Nearly all of his uplands have been
depleted of organic or vegetable matter.He did not put into the soil all
that the plants needed, and the fact that his crops were poor proves it.The materials he used may have been adulterated, or not in a form which
the plants could, assimilate at the time.Give Nature a soil in the right
mechanical condition--that is, light, mellow, moist, but not wet, and
containing the essential elements of a crop--and she will produce it
unless the season is so adverse that it cannot grow.I do not see how one
can hope to be successful unless he studies Nature's methods and learns
her needs, adapting his labor to the former, and supplying the latter.For instance, nitrogen in the form of ammonia is so essential to our
crops that without it they could never come to maturity were all the
other elements of plant food present in excess.Suppose that for several
successive years we grow wheat upon a field with an average crop of
twenty-five bushels to the acre.This amount of grain with its straw will
take from the soil about fifty-one pounds of ammonia annually, and when
the nitrogen (which is the main element of ammonia) gives out, the wheat
will fail, although other plant food may be present in abundance.This is
one reason why dairy farms from which all the milk is sold often grow
poor.Milk is exceedingly rich in nitrogen, and through the milk the farm
is depleted of this essential element faster than it is replaced by
fertilizers.A man may thus be virtually selling his farm, or that which
gives it value, without knowing it."asked the squire, with a look of helpless
perplexity."How is one to know when his land needs nitrogen or ammonia
and all the other kinds of plant food, as you call it, and how must he go
to work to get and apply it?""You are asking large questions, squire," Webb replied, with a quiet
smile."In the course of a year you decide a number of legal questions,
and I suppose read books, consult authorities, and use considerable
judgment.It certainly never would do for people to settle these
questions at hap-hazard or according to their own individual notions.Whatever the courts may do, Nature is
certain to reverse our decisions and bring to naught our action unless we
comply with her laws and requirements."The squire's experience coincided so truly with Webb's words that he
urged no further objections against accurate agricultural knowledge, even
though the information must be obtained in part at least from books and
journals.CHAPTER XVI

GOSSIP ABOUT BIRD-NEIGHBORS


"Doctor," said Mrs.Leonard, "Amy and I have been indulging in some
surmises over a remark you made the other day about the bluebirds.You
said the female was a cold, coy beauty, and that her mate would soon be
overburdened with family cares.Indeed, I think you rather reflected on
our sex as represented by Mrs.The female bluebird is singularly devoid of
sentiment, and takes life in the most serious and matter-of-fact way.Her
nest and her young are all in all to her.John Burroughs, who is a very
close observer, says she shows no affection for the male and no pleasure
in his society, and if he is killed she goes in quest of another mate in
the most business-like manner, as one would go to a shop on an errand."cried Maggie, with a glance at Leonard which
plainly said that such was not her style at all."Nevertheless," continued the doctor, "she awakens a love in her husband
which is blind to every defect.He is gallantry itself, and at the same
time the happiest and most hilarious of lovers.Since she insists on
building her nest herself, and having everything to her own mind, he does
not shrug his blue shoulders and stand indifferently or sullenly aloof.He goes with her everywhere, flying a little in advance as if for
protection, inspects her work with flattering minuteness, applauds and
compliments continually.Indeed, he is the ideal French beau very much in
love.""In other words, the counterpart of Leonard," said Burt, at which they
all laughed."But you spoke of his family cares," Webb remarked: "he contributes
something more than compliments, does he not?"He settles down into the most devoted of husbands and
fathers.The female usually hatches three broods, and as the season
advances he has his hands, or his beak rather, very full of business.I
think Burroughs is mistaken in saying that he is in most cases the
ornamental member of the firm.He feeds his wife as she sits on the nest,
and often the first brood is not out of the way before he has another to
provide for.Therefore he is seen bringing food to his wife and two sets
of children, and occasionally taking her place on the nest.Nor does he
ever get over his delusion that his mate is delighted with his song and
little gallantries, for he kepps them up also to the last.So he has to
be up early and late, and altogether must be a very tired little bird
when he gets a chance to put his head under his wing."and to think that she doesn't care for him!"sighed
Amy, pityingly; and they all laughed so heartily that she bent her head
over her work to hide the rich color that stole into her face--all
laughed except Mr.Alvord, who, as usual, was an attentive and quiet
listener, sitting a little in the background, so that his face was in
partial shadow.Keen-eyed Maggie, whose sympathies were deeply enlisted
in behalf of her sad and taciturn neighbor, observed that he regarded Amy
with a close, wistful scrutiny, as if he were reading her thoughts.Then
an expression of anguish, of something like despair, flitted across his
face."He has lavished the best treasures of his heart and life on some
one who did not care," was her mental comment."You won't be like our little friend in blue, eh, Amy?"Clifford; but with girlish shyness she would not reply to any such
question."Don't take it so to heart, Miss Amy.B. is never disenchanted," the
doctor remarked.B. at all," said Maggie, decidedly; "and it seems to
me that I know women of whom she is a type--women whose whole souls are
engrossed with their material life.Human husbands are not so blind as
bluebirds, and they want something more than housekeepers and nurses in
their wives."Barkdale; "you improve the occasion better
than I could.But, doctor, how about our callous widow bluebird finding
another mate after the mating season is over?""There are always some bachelors around, unsuccessful wooers whose early
blandishments were vain.""And are there no respectable spinsters with whom they might take up as a
last resort?"Think of that, ye maiden of New England, where the
males are nearly all migrants and do not return!The only chance for a
bird-bachelor is to console some widow whom accident has bereaved of her
mate.Widowers also are ready for an immediate second marriage.Birds and
beasts of prey and boys--hey, Alf--bring about a good many step-parents.""Alf don't kill any little birds, do you, Alf?"You said they felt so bad over it But if they get over
it so easy as the doctor says--"

"Now, doctor, you see the result of your scientific teaching."Leonard, are you in sympathy with the priestcraft that would
keep people virtuous through ignorance?""Alf must learn to do right, knowing all the facts.I don't believe he
will shy a stone at a bird this coming year unless it is in mischief.""Well," said Squire Bartley, who had relapsed into a half-doze as the
conversation lost its practical bent, "between the birds and boys I don't
see as we shall be able to raise any fruit before long.If our boys
hadn't killed about all the robins round our house last summer, I don't
think we'd 'a had a cherry or strawberry.""I'm afraid, squire," put in Webb, quietly, "that if all followed your
boys' example, insects would soon have the better of us.They are far
worse than the birds.I've seen it stated on good authority that a
fledgling robin eats forty per cent more than its own weight every
twenty-four hours, and I suppose it would be almost impossible to compute
the number of noxious worms and moths destroyed by a family of robins in
one season."Webb is right, squire," added the doctor, emphatically."Were it not for
the birds, the country would soon be as bare as the locusts left Egypt.Even the crow, against which you are so vindictive, is one of your best
friends.""Oh, now, come, I can't swallow that.Crows pull up my corn, rob hens'
nests', carry off young chickens.They even rob the nests of the other
birds you're so fond of.Why, some state legislatures give a bounty for
their destruction.""If there had only been a bounty for killing off the legislators, the
states would have fared better," replied the doctor, with some heat."It
can be proved beyond a doubt that the crow is unsurpassed by any other
bird in usefulness.He is one of the best friends you have.""Deliver me from my friends, then," said the squire, rising; and he
departed, with his prejudices against modern ideas and methods somewhat
confirmed.Like multitudes of his class, he observed in nature only that which was
forced upon his attention through the medium of immediate profit and
loss.The crows pulled up his corn, and carried off an occasional
chicken; the robins ate a little fruit; therefore death to crows and
robins.They all felt a certain sense of relief at his departure, for
while their sympathies touched his on the lower plane of mere utility and
money value, it would be bondage to them to be kept from other and higher
considerations.Moreover, in his own material sphere his narrow prejudices
were ever a jarring element that often exasperated Webb, who had been known
to mutter, "Such clods of earth bring discredit on our calling."Burt, with a mischievous purpose illuminating his face, remarked: "I'll
try to put the squire into a dilemma.If I can catch one of his boys
shooting robins out of season, I will lodge a complaint with him, and
insist on the fine;" and his design was laughingly applauded.Clifford, "that Webb has won me over to a toleration
of crows, but until late years I regarded them as unmitigated pests.""Undeserved enmity comes about in this way," Webb replied."We see a crow
in mischief occasionally, and the fact is laid up against him.If we
sought to know what he was about when not in mischief, our views would
soon change.It would be far better to have a little corn pulled up than
to be unable to raise corn at all.Crows can be kept from the field
during the brief periods when they do harm, but myriads of grasshoppers
cannot be managed.Moreover, the crow destroys very many field-mice and
other rodents, but chief of all he is the worst enemy of the May-beetle
and its larvae.In regions of the country where the crow has been almost
exterminated by poison and other means, this insect has left the meadows
brown and sear, while grasshoppers have partially destroyed the most
valuable crops.Why can't farmers get out of their plodding, ox-like
ways, and learn to co-work with Nature like men?""Who would have thought that the squire
and a crow could evoke such a peroration?That flower of eloquence surely
grew from a rank, dark soil.""Squire Bartley amuses me very much," said Mrs.Clifford, from the sofa,
with a low laugh."He seems the only one who has the power to ruffle
Webb.""Little wonder," thought Amy, "for it would be hard to find two natures
more antagonistic.""It seems to me that this has been a very silent winter," the minister
remarked."In my walks and drives of late I have scarcely heard the chirp
of a bird.Are there many that stay with us through this season, doctor?"But you would not be apt to meet many of
them unless you sought for them.At this time they are gathered in
sheltered localities abounding in their favorite food.Shall I tell you
about some that I have observed throughout several successive winters?"Having received eager encouragement, he resumed: "My favorites, the
bluebirds, we have considered quite at length.They are very useful, for
their food in summer consists chiefly of the smaller beetles and the
larvae of little butterflies and moths.It
is a question of food, not climate, with them.In certain valleys of the
White Mountains there is an abundance of berries, and flocks of robins
feed on them all winter, although the cold reaches the freezing-point of
mercury.As we have said, they are among the most useful of the insect
destroyers.The golden-crested kinglet is a little mite of a bird, not
four inches long, with a central patch of orange-red on his crown.He
breeds in the far North, and wintering here is for him like going to the
South.In summer he is a flycatcher, but here he searches the bark of
forest trees with microscopic scrutiny for the larvae of insects.We all
know the lively black-capped chickadees that fly around in flocks
throughout the winter.Sometimes their search for food leads them into
the heart of towns and cities, where they are as bold and as much at home
as the English sparrow.They also gather around the camps of log-cutters
in the forest, become very tame, and plaintively cry for their share in
the meals.They remain all the year, nesting in decayed logs, posts,
stumps, and even in sides of houses, although they prefer the edge of a
wood.If they can find a hole to suit them, very well; if they can't,
they will make one.A nest
in a decayed stump was uncovered, and the mother bird twice taken off by
hand, and each time she returned and covered her brood.She uttered no
cries or complaints, but devotedly interposed her little form between
what must have seemed terrific monsters and her young, and looked at the
human ogres with the resolute eyes of self-sacrifice.If she could have
known it, the monsters only wished to satisfy their curiosity, and were
admiring her beyond measure.Chickadees are exceedingly useful birds, and
make great havoc among the insects."Our next bird is merely a winter sojourner, for he goes north in spring
like the kinglet.The scientists, with a fine sense of the fitness of
things, have given him a name in harmony, _Troglodytes parvulus_, var."He is about as big as your thumb, and ordinary mortals are content to
call him the winter wren.He is a saucy little atom of a bird, with his
tail pointing rakishly toward his head.I regret exceedingly to add that
he is but a winter resident with us, and we rarely hear his song.Burroughs says that he is a'marvellous songster,' his notes having a
'sweet rhythmical cadence that holds you entranced.'By the way, if you
wish to fall in love with birds, you should read the books of John
Burroughs.Mary went to the bedroom.A little mite of a creature, like the hermit-thrush, he fills
the wild, remote woods of the North with melody, and has not been known
to breed further south than Lake Mohunk.The brown creeper and the
yellow-rumped warbler I will merely mention.Both migrate to the North in
the spring, and the latter is only an occasional winter resident.The
former is a queer little creature that alights at the base of a tree and
creeps spirally round and round to its very top, when it sweeps down to
the base of another tree to repeat the process.Purple finches are usually abundant in winter, though, not very
numerous in summer.I value them because they are handsome birds, and
both male and female sing in autumn and winter, when bird music is at a
premium.I won't speak of the Carolina wax-wing, _alias_ cedar or cherry
bird, now.Next June, when strawberries and cherries are ripe, we can
form his intimate acquaintance.""We have already made it, to the cost of both our patience and purse,"
said Webb."He is one of the birds for whom I have no mercy.""That is because you are not sufficiently acquainted with him.I admit
that he is an arrant thief of fruit, and that, as his advocate, I have a
difficult case.I shall not plead for him until summer, when he is in
such imminent danger of capital punishment He's a little beauty, though,
with his jaunty crest and gold-tipped tail.I shall not say one word in
favor of the next bird that I mention, the great Northern shrike, or
butcher-bird.He is not an honest bird of prey that all the smaller
feathered tribes know at a glance, like the hawk; he is a disguised
assassin, and possessed by the very demon of cruelty.He is a handsome
fellow, little over ten inches long, with a short, powerful beak, the
upper mandible sharply curved.His body is of a bluish-gray color, with
'markings of white' on his dusky wings and tail.Three shrikes once made
such havoc among the sparrows of Boston Common that it became necessary
to take much pains to destroy them.He is not only a murderer, but an
exceedingly treacherous one, for both Mr.Nuttall speak
of his efforts to decoy little birds within his reach by imitating their
notes, and he does this so closely that he is called a mocking-bird in
some parts of New England.When he utters his usual note and reveals
himself, his voice very properly resembles the 'discordant creaking of a
sign-board hinge.'A flock of snow-birds or finches may be sporting and
feeding in some low shrubbery, for instance.They may hear a bird
approaching, imitating their own notes.A moment later the shrike will be
seen among them, causing no alarm, for his appearance is in his favor.Suddenly he will pounce upon an unsuspecting neighbor, and with one blow
of his beak take off the top of its head, dining on its brains.If there
is a chance to kill several more, he will, like a butcher, hang his prey
on a thorn, or in the crotch of a tree, and return for his favorite
morsel when his hunt is over.After devouring the head of a bird he will
leave the body, unless game is scarce.It is well they are not plentiful,
or else our canary pets would be in danger, for a shrike will dart
through an open window and attack birds in cages, even when members of
the family are present.Brewer, the ornithologist,
was sitting by a closed window with a canary in a cage above his head,
and a shrike, ignorant of the intervening glass, dashed against the
window, and fell stunned upon the snow.He was taken in, and found to be
tame, but sullen.He refused raw meat, but tore and devoured little birds
very readily.As I said before, it is fortunate he is rare, though why he
is so I scarcely know.He may have enemies in the North, where he breeds;
for I am glad to say that he is only a winter resident."It gives one a genuine sense of relief to turn from this Apache, this
treacherous scalper of birds, to those genuinely useful little songsters,
the tree and the song sparrow.The former is essentially a Northern bird,
and breeds in the high arctic regions.He has a fine song, which we hear
in early April as his parting souvenir.The song sparrow will be a great
favorite with you, Miss Amy, for he is one of our finest singers, whose
song resembles the opening notes of a canary, but has more sweetness and
expression.Those that remain with us depart for the North at the first
tokens of spring, and are replaced by myriads of other migrants that
usually arrive early in March.They are very useful in destroying the worst kinds of insects.A fit
associate for the song sparrow is the American goldfinch, or yellow-bird,
which is as destructive of the seeds of weeds as the former is of the
smaller insect pests.In summer it is of a bright gamboge yellow, with
black crown, wings, and tail.At this time he is a little olive-brown
bird, and mingles with his fellows in small flocks.They are sometimes
killed and sold as reed-birds."The snow-bird and snow-bunting are not identical by any means; indeed,
each is of a different genus.The bunting's true home is in the far
North, and it is not apt to be abundant here except in severe weather.Specimens have been found, however, early in November, but more often
they appear with a late December snowstorm, their wild notes suggesting
the arctic wastes from which they have recently drifted southward.The
sleigh tracks on the frozen Hudson are among their favorite haunts, and
they are not often abundant in the woods on this side of the river.Flocks can usually be found spending the winter along the railroad on the
eastern shore.Here they become very fat, and so begrimed with the dirt
and grease on the track that you would never associate them with the
snowy North.They ever make, however, a singular and pretty spectacle
when flying up between one and the late afternoon sun, for the predominant
white in their wings and tail seems almost transparent.They breed at the
extreme North, even along the Arctic Sea, in Greenland and Iceland, and are
fond of marine localities at all times.It's hard to realize that the
little fellows with whom we are now so familiar start within a month for
regions above the Arctic Circle.I once, when a boy, fired into a flock
feeding in a sleigh track on the ice of the river.Some of those that
escaped soon returned to their dead and wounded companions, and in their
solicitude would let me come very near, nor, unless driven away, would they
leave the injured ones until life was extinct.On another occasion I
brought some wounded ones home, and they ate as if starved, and soon became
very tame, alighting upon the table at mealtimes with a freedom from
ceremony which made it necessary to shut them up.They spent most of their
time among the house plants by the window, but toward spring the migratory
instinct asserted itself, and they became very restless, pecking at the
panes in their eagerness to get away.Soon afterward our little guests may
have been sporting on an arctic beach.An effort was once made in
Massachusetts to keep a wounded snow-bunting through the summer, but at
last it died from the heat.They are usually on the wing northward early in
March."The ordinary snow-bird is a very unpretentious and familiar little
friend.You can find him almost any day from the 1st of October to the
1st of May, and may know him by his grayish or ashy black head, back, and
wings, white body underneath from the middle of his breast backward, and
white external tail-feathers.He is said to be abundant all over America
east of the Black Hills, and breeds as far south as the mountains of
Virginia.There are plenty of them in summer along the Shawangunk range,
just west of us, in the Catskills, and so northward above the Arctic
Circle.In the spring, before it leaves us, you will often hear its
pretty little song.They are very much afraid of hawks, which make havoc
among them at all times, but are fearless of their human--and especially
of their humane--neighbors.Severe weather will often bring them to our
very doors, and drive them into the outskirts of large cities.They are
not only harmless, but very useful, for they devour innumerable seeds,
and small insects with their larvae."And we could listen to you," chorused several voices."I never before realized that we had such interesting winter neighbors
and visitors," said Mrs.Clifford, and the lustre of her eyes and the
faint bloom on her cheeks proved how deeply these little children of
nature had enlisted her sympathies."They are interesting, even when in one short evening I can give but in
bald, brief outline a few of their characteristics.Your words suggest
the true way of becoming acquainted with them.Regard them as neighbors
and guests, in the main very useful friends, and then you will naturally
wish to know more about them.In most instances they are quite susceptible
to kindness, and are ready to be intimate with us.That handsome bird, the
blue jay, so wild at the East, is as tame and domestic as the robin in many
parts of the West, because treated well.He is also a winter resident, and
one of the most intelligent birds in existence.Indeed, he is a genuine
humorist, and many amusing stories are told of his pranks.His powers of
mimicry are but slightly surpassed by those of the mocking-bird, and it is
his delight to send the smaller feathered tribes to covert by imitating the
cries of the sparrow, hawk, and other birds of prey.When so tame as to
haunt the neighborhood of dwellings, he is unwearied in playing his tricks
on domestic fowls, and they--silly creatures!--never learn to detect the
practical joke, for, no matter how often it is repeated, they hasten
panic-stricken to shelter.Wilson speaks of him as the trumpeter of the
feathered chorus, but his range of notes is very great, passing from harsh,
grating sounds, like the screeching of an unlubricated axle, to a warbling
as soft and modulated as that of a bluebird, and again, prompted by his
mercurial nature, screaming like a derisive fish-wife.Fledglings will
develop contentedly in a cage, and become tame and amusing pets.They will
learn to imitate the human voice and almost every other familiar sound.A
gentleman in South Carolina had one that was as loquacious as a parrot, and
could utter distinctly several words.In this region they are hunted, and
too shy for familiar acquaintance.When a boy, I have been tantalized
almost beyond endurance by them, and they seemed to know and delight in the
fact.I was wild to get a shot at them, but they would keep just out of
range, mocking me with discordant cries, and alarming all the other game in
the vicinity.They often had more sport than I. It is a pity that the small
boy with his gun cannot be taught to let them alone.If they were as
domestic and plentiful as robins, they would render us immense service.A
colony of jays would soon destroy all the tent-caterpillars on your place,
and many other pests.In Indiana they will build in the shrubbery around
dwellings, but we usually hear their cries from mountain-sides and distant
groves.Pleasant memories of rambles and nutting excursions they always
awaken.The blue jay belongs to the crow family, and has all the brains of
his black-coated and more sedate cousins.At the North, he will, like a
squirrel, lay up for winter a hoard of acorns and beech mast.An
experienced bird-fancier asserts that he found the jay'more ingenious,
cunning, and teachable than any other species of birds that he had ever
attempted to instruct.'"One of our most beautiful and interesting winter visitants is the pine
grosbeak.Although very abundant in some seasons, even extending its
migrations to the latitude of Philadelphia, it is irregular, and only the
coldest weather prompts its excursions southward.The general color of
the males is a light carmine, or rose, and if only plentiful they would
make a beautiful feature in our snowy landscape.As a general thing, the
red tints are brighter in the American than in the European birds.The
females, however, are much more modest in their plumage, being ash-
above, with a trace of carmine behind their heads and upon their upper tail
coverts, and sometimes tinged with greenish-yellow beneath.The females are
by far our more abundant visitants, for in the winter of '75 I saw numerous
flocks, and not over two per cent were males in red plumage.Still, strange
to say, I saw a large flock of adult males the preceding November, feeding
on the seeds of a Norway spruce before our house.Oh, what a brilliant
assemblage they made among the dark branches!In their usual haunts they
live a very retired life.The deepest recesses of the pine forests at the
far North are their favorite haunts, and here the majority generally remain
throughout the year.In these remote wilds is bred the fearlessness of man
which is the result of ignorance, for they are among the tamest of all wild
birds, finding, in this respect, their counterpart in the American red
cross-bill, another occasional cold-weather visitant.For several winters
the grosbeaks were exceedingly abundant in the vicinity of Boston, and were
so tame that they could be captured in butterfly nets, and knocked down
with poles.The markets became full of them, and many were caged.While
tame they were very unhappy in confinement, and as spring advanced their
mournful cries over their captivity became incessant.They can be kept as
pets, however, and will often sing in the night.Audubon observed that
when he fired at one of their number, the others, instead of flying away,
would approach within a few feet, and gaze at him with undisguised
curiosity, unmingled with fear.I have seen some large flocks this winter,
and a few fed daily on a bare plot of ground at the end of our piazza.I
was standing above this plot one day, when a magnificent red male flew just
beneath my feet and drank at a little pool.I never saw anything more
lovely in my life than the varying sheen of his brilliant tropical-like
plumage.He was like a many-hued animated flower, and was so fearless that
I could have touched him with a cane.One very severe, stormy winter the
grosbeaks fairly crowded the streets of Pictou.A gentleman took one of
these half-starved birds into his room, where it lived at large, and soon
became the tamest and most affectionate of pets.But in the spring, when
its mates were migrating north, Nature asserted herself, and it lost its
familiarity, and filled the house with its piteous wailings, refused food,
and sought constantly to escape.When the grosbeaks are with us you would
not be apt to notice them unless you stumbled directly upon them, for they
are the most silent of birds, which is remarkable, since the great majority
of them are females"."That is just the reason why they are so still," remarked Mrs."Ladies never speak unless they have something to say.""Far be it from me to contradict you.The lady grosbeaks certainly have
very little to say to one another, though when mating in their secluded
haunts they probably express their preferences decidedly.If they have an
ear for music, they must enjoy their wooing immensely, for there is
scarcely a lovelier song than that of the male grosbeak.I never heard it
but once, and may never again; but the thrill of delight that I experienced
that intensely cold March day can never be forgotten.I was following the
course of a stream that flowed at the bottom of a deep ravine, when, most
unexpectedly, I heard a new song, which proceeded from far up the glen.The
notes were loud, rich, and sweet, and I hastened on to identify the new
vocalist.I soon discovered a superb red pine grosbeak perched on the top
of a tall hemlock.His rose- plumage and mellow notes on that bleak
day caused me to regret exceedingly that he was only an uncertain and
transient visitor to our region."We have a large family of resident hawks in this vicinity; indeed, there
are nine varieties of this species of bird with us at this time, although
some of them are rarely seen.The marsh-hawk has a bluish or brown
plumage, and in either case is distinguished by a patch of white on its
upper tail coverts.You would not be apt to meet with it except in its
favorite haunts.I found a nest in the centre of Consook Marsh, below
West Point.The nests of this hawk are usually made
of hay, lined with pine needles, and sometimes at the North with
feathers.This bird is found nearly everywhere in North America, and
breeds as high as Hudson Bay.In the marshes on the Delaware it is often
called the mouse-hawk, for it sweeps swiftly along the low ground in
search of a species of mouse common in that locality.It is said to be
very useful in the Southern rice-fields, since, as it sails low, it
interrupts the flocks of bobolinks, or rice-birds, in their depredations.Planters say that one marsh-hawk accomplishes more than several <DW64>s
in alarming these greedy little gourmands.In this region they do us no
practical harm."Our most abundant hawk is the broad-winged, which will measure about
thirty-six inches with wings extended.The plumage of this bird is so
dusky as to impart a prevalent brownish color, and the species is
distributed generally over eastern North America.Unlike the marsh-hawk,
it builds in trees, and Mr.Audubon describes a nest as similar to that
of the crow--a resemblance easily accounted for by the frequency with
which this hawk will repair crows' nests of former years for its own use.I once shot one upon such a nest, from which I had taken crows' eggs the
preceding summer.I had only wounded the bird, and he clawed me severely
before I was able to capture him.I once took a fledgling from a nest,
and he became very fond of me, and quite gentle, but he would not let any
one else handle him.On another occasion, when I was examining a nest,
the male bird flew to a branch just over it, uttering loud, squealing
cries, thence darted swiftly past me, and so close that I could feel the
rush of air made by his wings; then he perched near again, and threatened
me in every way he could, extending his wings, inclining his head and
body toward me, making meanwhile a queer whistling sound.Only when I
reached the nest would the female leave it, and then she withdrew but a
short distance, returning as soon as I began to descend.The devotion of
these wild creatures to their young is often marvellous.Audubon
describes this hawk as'spiritless, inactive, and so deficient in courage
that he is often chased by the little sparrow-hawk and kingbird.'Another
naturalist dissents emphatically from this view, and regards the
broad-winged as the most courageous and spirited of his family, citing an
instance of a man in his employ who, while ascending to a nest, was
assailed with great fury.His hat was torn from his head, and he would
have been injured had not the bird been shot.He also gives another
example of courage in an attack by this hawk upon a boy seeking to rob
its nest.It fastened its talons in his arm, and could not be beaten off
until it was killed.It is brave and
fierce when its home is disturbed, and lacks the courage to attack other
birds of its own kind.At any rate, it has no hesitancy in making
hawk-love to chickens and ducklings, but as a rule subsists on insects
and small quardrupeds.It is not a very common winter resident, but early
in March it begins to come northward in flocks."Next to the broad-winged, the sharp-shinned is our most abundant hawk,
and is found throughout the entire continent from Hudson Bay to Mexico.It
usually builds its nest in trees, and occasionally on ledges of rocks,
and as a general thing takes some pains in its construction.Its domicile
approaches the eagle's nest in form, is broad and shallow, and made of
sticks and twigs lined thinly with dried leaves, mosses, etc.A full-grown
female--which, as I told you once before, is always larger than the male
among birds of prey--measures about twenty-six inches with wings extended.It is lead- above, and lighter beneath.You can easily recognize
this hawk by its short wings, long tail, and swift, irregular flight.One
moment it is high in the air, the next it disappears in the grass, having
seized the object of its pursuit.It is capable of surprisingly sudden
dashes, and its pursuit is so rapid that escape is wellnigh hopeless.Audubon saw one dart into a thicket of
briers, strike and instantly kill a thrush, and emerge with it on the
opposite side.One came every
day to a poultry-yard until it had carried off over twenty.It does not
hesitate to pounce down upon a chicken even in the farmer's presence; and
one, in a headlong pursuit, broke through the glass of a greenhouse, then
dashed through another glass partition, and was only brought up by a third.Pigeons are also quite in its line.Indeed, it is a bold red-taloned
freebooter, and only condescends to insects and the smaller reptiles when
there are no little birds at hand.During the spring migration this hawk
is sometimes seen in large flocks."The American goshawk is the next bird of this family that I will
mention, and I am very glad to say that he is only a winter resident.He
is the dreaded blue hen-hawk of New England, and is about twenty-three
inches long, and forty-four from tip to tip of wings.One good authority
says that for strength, intrepidity, and fury he cannot be surpassed.He
will swoop down into a poultry-yard and carry off a chicken almost before
you can take a breath.He is swift, cunning, and adroit rather than
heedless and headlong, like the sharp-shinned hawk, and although the
bereaved farmer may be on the alert with his gun, this marauder will
watch his chance, dash into the yard, then out again with his prey, so
suddenly that only the despairing cries of the fowl reveal the murderous
onslaught.A housewife will
hear a rush of wings and cries of terror, and can only reach the door in
time to see one of these robbers sailing off with the finest of her
pullets.Hares and wild-ducks are favorite game also.The goshawk will
take a mallard with perfect ease, neatly and deliberately strip off the
feathers, and then, like an epicure, eat the breast only.Audubon once
saw a large flock of blackbirds crossing the Ohio.Like an arrow a
goshawk darted upon them, while they, in their fright, huddled together.The hawk seized one after another, giving each a death-squeeze, then
dropping it into the water.In this way he killed five before the flock
escaped into the woods.He then leisurely went back, picked them up one
by one, and carried them to the spot selected for his lunch.With us, I
am happy to say, he is shy and distant, preferring the river marshes to
the vicinity of our farmyards.He usually takes his prey while swooping
swiftly along on the wing."Have we any hawks similar to those employed in the old-time falconry of
Europe?""Yes; our duck or great-footed hawk is almost identical with the
well-known peregrine falcon of Europe.It is a permanent resident, and
breeds on the inaccessible cliffs of the Highlands, although preferring
similar localities along a rocky sea-coast.There is no reason to doubt
that our duck-hawk might be trained for the chase as readily as its
foreign congener.It has the same wonderful powers of flight, equal
docility in confinement, and can be taught to love and obey its master.I
have often wondered why falconry has not been revived, like other ancient
sports.The Germans are said to have employed trained hawks to capture
carrier-pigeons that were sent out with missives by the French during the
siege of Paris.In a few instances the duck-hawk has been known to nest
in trees.It is a solitary bird, and the sexes do not associate except at
the breeding season.While it prefers water-fowl, it does not confine
itself to them.I shot one on a Long Island beach and found in its crop
whole legs of the robin, Alice's thrush, catbird, and warblers.It
measures about forty-five inches in the stretch of its wings, and its
prevailing color is of a dark blue."The pigeon-hawk is not very rare at this season.Professor Baird
describes this bird as remarkable for its rapid flight, its courage, and
its enterprise in attacking birds even larger than itself.This accords
with my experience, for my only specimen was shot in the act of destroying
a hen.He is about the size of our common flicker, or high-holder, which
bird, with robins, pigeons, and others of similar size, is his favorite
game.The sparrow-hawk is rare at this time, and is only abundant
occasionally during its migrations.The red-shouldered hawk is a handsome
bird, with some very good traits, and is a common permanent resident.Unless hunted, these birds are not shy, and they remain mated throughout
the year.Many a human pair might learn much from their affectionate and
considerate treatment of each other.They do not trouble poultry-yards, and
are fond of frogs, cray-fish, and even insects.Occasionally they will
attack birds as large as a meadow-lark.They have a high and very irregular
flight, but occasionally they so stuff themselves with frogs that they can
scarcely move.Wilson found one with the remains of ten frogs in his crop."Last among the winter residents I can merely mention the red-tailed
hawk, so named from the deep rufus color of its tail feathers.It is a
heavy, robust bird, and while it usually feeds on mice, moles, and shrews
that abound in meadows, its depredations on farmyards are not infrequent.It is widely distributed throughout the continent, and abundant here.It
is a powerful bird, and can compass long distances with a strong, steady
flight, often moving with no apparent motion of the wings.It rarely
seizes its prey while flying, like the goshawk, but with its keen vision
will inspect the immediate vicinity from the branch of a tree, and thence
dart upon it.Insects, birds, and
reptiles are alike welcome game, and in summer it may be seen carrying a
writhing snake through the air.While flying it utters a very harsh,
peculiar, and disagreeable scream, and by some is called the squealing
hawk.The social habits of this bird are in appropriate concord with its
voice.After rearing their young the sexes separate, and are jealous of
and hostile to each other.It may easily happen that if the wife of the
spring captures any prey, her former mate will struggle fiercely for its
possession, and the screaming clamor of the fight will rival a conjugal
quarrel in the Bowery.In this respect they form an unpleasing contrast
with the red-shouldered hawks, among whom marriage is permanent, and
maintained with lover-like attentions.Thus it would appear that there
are contrasts of character even in the hawk world; and when you remember
that we have fifteen other varieties of this bird, besides the nine I
have mentioned, you may think that nature, like society, is rather
prodigal in hawks.As civilization advances, however, innocence stands a
better chance.At least this is true of the harmless song-birds."I have now given you free-hand sketches of the great majority of our
winter residents, and these outlines are necessarily very defective from
their brevity as well as for other reasons.I have already talked an
unconscionably long time; but what else could you expect from a man with
a hobby?As it is, I am not near through, for the queer little
white-bellied nut-hatch, and his associates in habits, the downy, the
hairy, the golden-winged, and the yellow-bellied woodpeckers, and four
species of owls, are also with us at this season.With the bluebirds the
great tide of migration has already turned northward, and all through
March, April, and May I expect to greet the successive arrivals of old
friends every time I go out to visit my patients.I can assure you that I
have no stupid, lonely drives, unless the nights are dark and stormy.Little Johnnie, I see, has gone to sleep.I must try to meet some fairies
and banshees in the moonlight for her benefit But, Alf, I'm delighted to
see you so wide-awake.Shooting birds as game merely is very well, but
capturing them in a way to know all about them is a sport that is always
in season, and would grow more and more absorbing if you lived a thousand
years."A bent for life was probably given to the boy's mind that night.CHAPTER XVII

FISHING THROUGH THE ICE


Every day through the latter part of February the sun grew higher, and
its rays more potent.The snow gave rapidly in warm southern nooks and
<DW72>s, and the icicles lengthened from the eaves and overhanging rocks,
forming in many instances beautiful crystal fringes.On northern <DW72>s
and shaded places the snow scarcely wasted at all, and Amy often wondered
how the vast white body that covered the earth could ever disappear in
time for spring.But there soon came a raw, chilly, cloudy day, with a
high south wind, and the snow sank away, increasing the apparent height
of the fences, and revealing objects hitherto hidden, as if some magic
were at work.Clifford, "that a day like this, raw
and cold as it seems, does more to carry off the snow than a week of
spring sunshine, although it may be warm for the season.What is more,
the snow is wasted evenly, and not merely on sunny <DW72>s.The wind seems
to soak up the melting snow like a great sponge, for the streams are not
perceptibly raised.""The air does take it up the form of vapor," said Webb, "and that is why
we have such a chilly snow atmosphere.Rapidly melting snow tends to
lower the temperature proportionately, just as ice around a form of
cream, when made to melt quickly the addition of salt, absorbs all heat
in its vicinity so fast that the cream is congealed.But this accumulation
of vapor in the air must come down again, perhaps in the form of snow, and
so there will be no apparent gain.""If no apparent gain, could there be a real gain by another fall of
snow?"Amy asked; for to inexperienced eyes there certainly seemed more
than could be disposed of in time for April flowers."Yes," he replied, "a fall of snow might make this whole section warmer
for a time, and so hasten spring materially.We shall have
plenty of snowstorms yet, and still spring will be here practically on
time."But instead of snow the vapor-burdened air relieved itself by a rain of
several hours' duration, and in the morning the river that had been so
white looked icy and glistening, and by the aid of a glass was seen to be
covered with water, which rippled under the rising breeze.The following
night was clear and cold, and the surface of the bay became a comparatively
smooth glare of ice.At dinner next day Webb remarked:

"I hear that they are catching a good many striped bass through the ice,
and I learned that the tide would be right for them to raise the nets
this afternoon.I propose, Amy, that we go down and see the process, and
get some of the fish direct from the water for supper."Burt groaned, and was almost jealous that during his enforced confinement
so many opportunities to take Amy out fell naturally to Webb.The latter,
however, was so entirely fraternal in his manner toward the young girl
that Burt was ever able to convince himself that his misgivings were
absurd.Webb was soon ready, and had provided himself with his skates and a small
sleigh with a back.When they arrived at the landing he tied his horse,
and said:

"The ice is too poor to drive on any longer, I am informed, but perfectly
safe still for foot-passengers.As a precaution we will follow the tracks
of the fishermen, and I will give you a swift ride on this little sledge,
in which I can wrap you up well."Like most young men brought up in the vicinity, he was a good and powerful
skater, and Amy was soon enjoying the exhilarating sense of rapid motion
over the smooth ice, with a superb view of the grand mountains rising on
either side of the river a little to the south.They soon reached the nets,
which stretched across the river through narrow longitudinal cuts so as to
be at right angles to each tide, with which the fish usually swim.These
nets are such in shape as were formerly suspended between the old-fashioned
shad-poles, and are sunk perpendicularly in the water by weights at each
end, so that the meshes are expanded nearly to their full extent.The fish
swim into these precisely as do the shad, and in their attempts to back out
their gills catch, and there they hang.The nests are about twelve feet square, and the meshes of different nets
are from to and a half to five and a quarter inches in size.A bass of
nine pounds' weight can be "gilled" in the ordinary manner; but in one
instance a fish weighing one hundred and two pounds was caught, and
during the present season they were informed that a lucky fisherman at
Marlborough had secured "a 52-pounder."These heavy fellows, it was
explained, "would go through a net like a cannon-ball" if they came "head
on," and with ordinary speed; but if they are playing around gently, the
swift tide carries them sidewise into the "slack of the net," from which
they seem unable to escape.There are usually about forty-five feet
between the surface of the water and the top of the nets, therefore the
fish are caught at an average depth of fifty feet.The best winter
fishing is from December to March, and as many as one hundred and seventy
pounds, or about two hundred bass, have been taken in twenty-four hours
from one line of nets; at other times the luck is very bad, for the fish
seem to run in streaks.The luck was exceedingly moderate on the present occasion, but enough
fish were caught to satisfy Webb's needs.As they were watching the
lifting of the nets and angling for information, they saw an ice-boat
slowly and gracefully leaving the landing, and were told that since the
ice had grown thin it had taken the place of the sleigh in which the
passengers were conveyed to and from the railroad station on the further
shore.The wind, being adverse, necessitated several tacks, and on one of
them the boat passed so near Webb and Amy that they recognized Mr.Barkdale, the clergyman, who, as he sped by, saluted them.When the boat
had passed on about an eighth of a mile, it tacked so suddenly and
sharply that the unwary minister was rolled out upon the ice.The speed
and impetus of the little craft were so great that before it could be
brought up it was about half a mile away, and the good man was left in
what might be a dangerous isolation, for ice over which the boat could
skim in security might be very unsafe under the stationary weight of a
solidly built man like Mr.Webb therefore seized a pole
belonging to one of the fishermen, and came speedily to the clergyman's
side.Happily the ice, although it had wasted rapidly from the action of
the tide in that part of the river, sustained them until the boat
returned, and the good man resumed his journey with laughing words, by
which he nevertheless conveyed to Webb his honest gratitude for the
promptness with which the young fellow had shared his possible danger.When Webb returned he found Amy pale and agitated, for an indiscreet
fisherman had remarked that the ice was "mighty poor out in that
direction.""Won't you please come off the river?""But you were not here a moment since, and I've no confidence in your
discretion when any one is in danger.""I did not run any risks worth speaking of."The men explained, in answer to my questions, that the
ice toward spring becomes honeycombed--that's the way they expressed
it--and lets one through without much warning.Daniel went to the hallway.They also said the tides
wore it away underneath about as fast as the rain and sun wasted the
surface.""Supposing it had let me through, I should have caught on the pole, and
so have easily scrambled out, while poor Mr.Barkdale would have been
quite helpless.""Oh, I know it was right for you to go, and I know you will go again
should there be the slightest occasion.Therefore I am eager to reach
solid ground.Her tone was so earnest that he complied, and they were soon in the
sleigh again.As they were driving up the hill she turned a shy glance
toward him, and said, hesitatingly: "Don't mistake me, Webb.I am proud
to think that you are so brave and uncalculating at times; but then I--I
never like to think that you are in danger.Remember how very much you
are to us all.""Well, that is rather a new thought to me."Yes, you are," she said, gravely and earnestly, looking him frankly in
the face."From the first moment you spoke to me as'sister Amy' you made
the relation seem real.And then your manner is so strong and even that
it's restful to be with you.You may give one a terrible fright, as you
did me this afternoon, but you would never make one nervous."His face flushed with deep pleasure, but he made good her opinion by
quietly changing the subject, and giving her a brisk, bracing drive over
one of her favorite roads.All at the supper table agreed that the striped bass were delicious, and
Burt, as the recognized sportsman of the family, had much to say about
the habits of this fine game fish.Among his remarks he explained that
the "catch" was small at present because the recent rain and melting snow
had made the water of the river so fresh that the fish had been driven
back toward the sea."But they reascend," he said, "as soon as the
freshet subsides.They are a sea fish, and only ascend fresh-water
streams for shelter in winter, and to breed in spring.They spawn in May,
and by August the little fish will weigh a quarter of a pound.A good
many are taken with seines after the ice breaks up, but I never had any
luck with pole and line in the river.While striped bass are found all
along the coast from Florida to Cape Cod, the largest fish are taken
between the latter place and Montauk Point.I once had some rare sport
off the east end of Long Island.I was still-fishing, with a pole and
reel, and fastened on my hook a peeled shedder crab.My line was of
linen, six hundred feet long, and no heavier than that used for trout,
but very strong.By a quick movement which an old bass-fisherman taught
me I made my bait dart like an arrow straight over the water more than
one hundred feet, my reel at the same moment whirling, in paying out, as
if it would fuse from friction.Well, I soon hooked a fifty-pound fish,
and we had a tussle that I shall never forget.It took me an hour to tire
him out, and I had to use all the skill I possessed to keep him from
breaking the line.It was rare sport, I can tell you--the finest bit of
excitement I ever had fishing;" and the young fellow's eyes sparkled at
the memory.Strange as it may appear to some, his mother shared most largely in his
enthusiasm.The reason was that, apart from the interest which she took
in the pleasure of all her children, she lived much in her imagination,
which was unusually strong, and Burt's words called up a marine picture
with an athletic young fellow in the foreground all on the _qui
vive_, his blue eyes flashing with the sparkle and light of the sea as
he matched his skill and science against a creature stronger than
himself."Are larger bass ever taken with rod and line?""Yes, one weighing seventy-five pounds has been captured."How big do they grow, anyhow?""To almost your size, Len, and that's a heavy compliment to the bass.They have been known to reach the weight of one hundred and fifty
pounds."CHAPTER XVIII

PLANNING AND OPENING THE CAMPAIGN


The last day of February was clear, cloudless, and cold, the evening
serene and still.Winter's tempestuous course was run, its icy breath
apparently had ceased, and darkness closed on its quiet, pallid face."March came in like a lamb"--an ominous circumstance for the future
record of this month of most uncertain weather, according to the
traditions of the old weather-prophets.The sun rose clear and warm, the
snow sparkled and melted, the bluebirds rejoiced, and their soft notes of
mutual congratulation found many echoes among their human neighbors.By
noon the air was wonderfully soft and balmy, and Webb brought in a number
of sprays from peach-trees cut in different parts of the place, and
redeemed his promise to Amy, showing her the fruit germs, either green,
or rather of a delicate gold-color, or else blackened by frost.She was
astonished to find how perfect the embryo blossom appeared under the
microscope.It needed no glass, however, to reveal the blackened heart of
the bud, and Webb, having cut through a goodly number, remarked: "It
would now appear as if nature had performed a very important labor for
us, for I find about eight out of nine buds killed.It will save us
thinning the fruit next summer, for if one-ninth of the buds mature into
peaches they will not only bring more money, but will measure more by the
bushel.""How can one peach measure more than eight peaches?"If all these buds grew into peaches, and
were left on these slender boughs, the tree might be killed outright by
overbearing, and would assuredly be much injured and disfigured by broken
limbs and exhaustion, while the fruit itself would be so small and poor
as to be unsalable.Thousands of trees annually perish from this cause,
and millions of peaches are either not picked, or, if marketed, may bring
the grower into debt for freight and other expenses.A profitable crop of
peaches can only be grown by careful hand-thinning when they are as large
as marbles, unless the frost does the work for us by killing the greater
part of the buds.It is a dangerous ally, however, for our constant fear
is that it will destroy _all_ the buds.There are plenty left yet, and I
find that cherry, apple, plum, and pear buds are still safe.Indeed,
there is little fear for them as long as peach buds are not entirely
destroyed, for they are much hardier."In the afternoon Burt, who had become expert in the use of crutches,
determined on an airing, and invited Amy to join him."I now intend to
begin giving you driving lessons," he said."You will soon acquire entire
confidence, for skill, far more than strength, is required.As long as
one keeps cool and shows no fear there is rarely danger.Horses often
catch their senseless panic from their drivers, and, even when frightened
with good cause, can usually be reassured by a few quiet words and a firm
rein."Amy was delighted at the prospect of a lesson in driving, especially as
Bart, because of his lameness, did not venture to take his over-spirited
steed Thunder.She sincerely hoped, however, that he would confine his
thoughts and attentions to the ostensible object of the drive, for his
manner at times was embarrassingly ardent.Burt was sufficiently politic
to fulfil her hope, for he had many other drives in view, and had
discovered that attentions not fraternal were unwelcome to Amy.With a
self-restraint and prudence which he thought most praiseworthy and
sagacious, but which were ludicrous in their limitations, he resolved to
take a few weeks to make the impression which he had often succeeded in
producing in a few hours, judging from the relentings and favors received
in a rather extended career of gallantry, although it puzzled the young
fellow that he could have been so fascinated on former occasions.He
merely proposed that now she should enjoy the drive so thoroughly that
she would wish to go again, and his effort met with entire success.During the first week of March there were many indications of the opening
campaign on the Clifford farm.There was the overhauling and furbishing
of weapons, otherwise tools, and the mending or strengthening of those in
a decrepit state.John travelled to the bedroom.A list of such additional ones as were wanted was made
at this time, and an order sent for them at once.Amy also observed that
practical Leonard was conning several catalogues of implements."Len is
always on the scent of some new patent hoe or cultivator," Burt remarked."My game pays better than yours," was the reply, "for the right kind of
tools about doubles the effectiveness of labor."The chief topic of discussion and form of industry at this time were the
pruning and cleansing of trees, and Amy often observed Webb from her
windows in what seemed to her most perilous positions in the tops of
apple and other trees, with saw and pruning shears or nippers--a light
little instrument with such a powerful leverage that a good-sized bough
could be lopped away by one slight pressure of the hand."It seems to me," remarked Leonard, one evening, "that there is much
diversity of opinion in regard to the time and method of trimming trees.While the majority of our neighbors prune in March, some say fall or
winter is the best time.Others are in favor of June, and in some paper
I've read, 'Prune when your knife is sharp.'As for cleansing the bark of
the trees, very few take the trouble.""Well," replied his father, "I've always performed these labors in March
with good results.I have often observed that taking off large limbs from
old and feeble trees is apt to injure them.A decay begins at the point
of amputation and extends down into the body of the tree.Sap-suckers and
other wood peckers, in making their nests, soon excavate this rotten wood
back into the trunk, to which the moisture of every storm is admitted,
and the life of the tree is shortened."At this point Webb went out, and soon returned with something like
exultation blending with his usually grave expression."I think father's views are correct, and I have confirmation here in
autograph letters from three of the most eminent horticulturists in the
world--"

"Good gracious, Webb!don't take away our breath in that style,"
exclaimed Burt."Have you autograph letters from several autocrats also?"As usual Webb ignored his brother's nonsense, and resumed: "The first is
from the Hon.Marshall P. Wilder, President of the American Pomological
Society, and is as follows: 'I prune my trees early in March, as soon as
the heavy frosts are over, when the sap is dormant.If the branch is
large I do not cut quite close in, and recut close in June, when the
wound heals more readily.I do not approve of rigorous pruning of old
trees showing signs of feebleness.Such operations would increase
decline--only the dead wood should be removed, the loss of live wood
depriving old trees of the supply of sap which they need for support.Grafting-wax is good to cover the wounds of trees, or a thick paint of
the color of the bark answers well.Trees also may be pruned in safety in
June after the first growth is made--then the wounds heal quickly.'Charles Downing, editor of 'The Fruits and
Fruit-Trees of America.''When the extreme cold weather is over,' he
says,'say the last of February or first of March, begin to trim trees,
and finish as rapidly as convenient.Do not trim a tree too much at one
time, and cut no large limbs if possible, but thin out the small
branches.If the trees are old and bark-bound, scrape off the roughest
bark and wash the bodies and large limbs with whale-oil soap, or
soft-soap such as the farmers make, putting it on quite thick.Give the
ground plenty of compost manure, bone-dust, ashes, and salt.The best and
most convenient preparation for covering wounds is gum-shellac dissolved
in alcohol to the thickness of paint, and put on with a brush.'Patrick Barry, of the eminent Rochester firm, and author of
'The Fruit Garden.''In our climate pruning may be done at convenience,
from the fall of the leaf until the 1st of April.In resuscitating old
neglected apple-trees, _rigorous_ pruning may be combined with plowing
and manuring of the ground.For covering wounds made in pruning, nothing
is better than common grafting wax laid on warm with a brush.'Hon P. T.
Quinn, in his work on 'Pear Culture,' writes: 'On our own place we begin
to prune our pear-trees from the 1st to the 15th of March, and go on with
the work through April.It is not best to do much cutting, except on very
young trees, while the foliage is coming out.'""Well," remarked Leonard, "I can go to work to-morrow with entire
content; and very pleasant work it is, too, especially on the young
trees, where by a little forethought and a few cuts one can regulate the
form and appearance of the future tree.""Well, you see there are plenty of buds on all the young branches, and we
can cut a branch just above the bud we wish to grow which will continue
to grow in the direction in which it points.Thus we can shape each
summer's growth in any direction we choose.""How can you be sure to find a bud just where you want it?""Of course we do," said Webb, "for buds are arranged spirally on trees
in mathematical order.On most trees it is termed-the 'five-ranked
arrangement,' and every bud is just two-fifths of the circumference of the
stem from the next.This will bring every sixth bud or leaf over the first,
or the one we start with.Thus in the length of stem occupied by five buds
you have buds facing in five different directions--plenty of choice for
all pruning purposes.""Oh, nonsense, Webb; you are too everlastingly scientific.Buds and
leaves are scattered at haphazard all over the branches.""That shows you observe at haphazard.Wait, and I'll prove I'm right;"
and he seized his hat and went out.Returning after a few minutes with
long, slender shoots of peach, apple, and pear trees, he said: "Now put
your finger on any bud, and count.See if the sixth bud does not stand
invariably over the one you start from, and if the intervening buds do
not wind spirally twice around the stem, each facing in a different
direction."He laughed, and said: "There, Len,
you've seen buds and branches for over forty years, and never noticed
this.Here, Alf, you begin right, and learn to see things just as they
are.There's no telling how often accurate knowledge may be useful.""But, Webb, all plants have not the five-ranked arrangement, as you term
it," his mother protested.There is the two-ranked, in which the third leaf stands over the
first; the three-ranked, in which the fourth leaf stands over the first.Then we also find the eighth and thirteenth ranked arrangements,
according to the construction of various species of plants or trees.But
having once observed an arrangement of buds or leaves in a species, you
will find it maintained with absolute symmetry and accuracy, although the
spaces between the buds lengthwise upon the stem may vary very much.Nature, with all her seeming carelessness and _abandon_, works on strict
mathematical principles.""Well," said Alf, "I'm going to see if you are right tomorrow.And on the following day he tried his best to
prove Webb wrong, but failed.Before the week was over there was a decided return of winter.The sky
lost its spring-like blue.Cold, ragged clouds were driven wildly by a
northeast gale, which, penetrating the heaviest wraps, caused a shivering
sense of discomfort.Only by the most vigorous exercise could one cope
with the raw, icy wind, and yet the effort to do so brought a rich return
in warm, purified blood.All outdoor labor, except such as required
strong, rapid action, came to an end, for it was the very season and
opportunity for pneumonia to seize upon its chilled victim.To a family
constituted like the Cliffords such weather brought no _ennui_.They
had time for more music and reading aloud than usual.The pets in the
flower-room needed extra care and watching, for the bitter wind searched
out every crevice and cranny.Entering the dining-room on one occasion,
Amy found the brothers poring over a map spread out on the table."It certainly is a severe stress of
weather that has brought you all to that."These are our Western Territories," Burt promptly responded."This
prominent point here is Fort Totem, and these indications of adjacent
buildings are for the storage of furs, bear-meat, and the accommodation
of Indian hunters."Burt tried to look serious, but Webb's and Leonard's
laughter betrayed him.Amy turned inquiringly to Webb, as she ever did
when perplexed."Don't mind Burt's chaff," he said."This is merely a map of the farm,
and we are doing a little planning for our spring work--deciding what
crop we shall put on that field and how treat this one, etc.You can see,
Amy, that each field is numbered, and here in this book are corresponding
numbers, with a record of the crops grown upon each field for a good many
years back, to what extent and how often they have been enriched, and the
kind of fertilizers used.Of course such a book of manuscript would be
the dreariest prose in the world to you, but it is exceedingly interesting
to us; and what's more, these past records are the best possible guides for
future action.""Oh, I know all about your book now," she said, with an air of entire
confidence, "for I've heard papa say that land and crop records have been
kept in England for generations.I don't think I will sit up nights to
read your manuscript, however.If Burt's version had been true, it might
have been quite exciting."Clifford in overhauling the seed-chest,
however.This was a wooden box, all tinned over to keep out the mice, and
was divided into many little compartments, in which were paper bags of
seeds, with the date on which they were gathered or purchased.Some of
the seeds were condemned because too old; others, like those of melons
and cucumbers, improved with a moderate degree of age, she was told.Clifford brought out from her part of the chest a rich store of flower
seeds, and the young girl looked with much curiosity on the odd-appearing
little grains and scale-like objects in which, in miniature, was wrapped
some beautiful and fragrant plant."Queer little promises, ain't they?"said the old lady; "for every seed is a promise to me.""I tell you what it is, Amy," the old gentleman remarked, "this chest
contains the assurance of many a good dinner and many a beautiful
bouquet.Now, like a good girl, help us make an inventory.We will first
have a list of what we may consider trustworthy seeds on hand, and then,
with the aid of these catalogues, we can make out another list of what we
shall buy.Seed catalogues, with their long list of novelties, never lose
their fascination for me.I know that most of the new things are not half
so good as the old tried sorts, but still I like to try some every year.It's a harmless sort of gambling, you see, and now and then I draw a
genuine prize.Mother has the gambling mania far worse than I, as is
evident from the way she goes into the flower novelties.""I own up to it," said Mrs.Clifford, "and I do love to see the almost
endless diversity in beauty which one species of plants will exhibit.Why, do you know, Amy, I grew from seeds one summer fifty distinct
varieties of the dianthus.Suppose we take asters this year, and see how
many distinct kinds we can grow.Here, in this catalogue, is a long list
of named varieties, and, in addition, there are packages of mixed seeds
from which we may get something distinct from all the others.""How full of zest life becomes in the country," cried Amy, "if one only
goes to work in the right way!"Life was growing fuller and richer to her
every day in the varied and abounding interests of the family with which
she was now entirely identified."Webb," his mother asked at dinner, "how do you explain the varying
vitality of seeds?Some we can keep six or eight years, and others only
two.""That's a question I am unable to answer.It cannot be the amount of
material stored up in the cotyledons, or embryo seed leaves, for small
seeds like the beet and cucumber will retain their vitality ten years,
and lettuce, turnip, and tomato seed five or more years, while I do not
care to plant large, fleshy seeds like pease and beans that are over
three years old, and much prefer those gathered the previous season.The
whole question of the germinating of seeds is a curious one.Wheat taken
from the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy has grown.Many seeds appear to
have a certain instinct when to grow, and will lie dormant in the ground
for indefinite periods waiting for favorable conditions.For instance,
sow wood-ashes copiously and you speedily have a crop of white clover.Again, when one kind of timber is cut from land, another and diverse kind
will spring up, as if the soil were full of seeds that had been biding
their time.For all practical purposes the duration of vitality is known,
and is usually given in seed catalogues, I think, or ought to be.""Some say that certain fertilizers or conditions will produce certain
kinds of vegetation without the aid of seeds--just develop them, you
know," Leonard remarked."Well, I think the sensible answer is that all vegetation is developed
from seeds, spores, or whatever was designed to continue the chain of
being from one plant to another.For the life of me I can't see how mere
organic or inorganic matter can produce life.It can only sustain and
nourish the life which exists in it or is placed in it, and which by a
law of nature develops when the conditions are favorable.I am quite sure
that there is not an instance on record of the spontaneous production of
life, even down to the smallest animalcule in liquids, or the minutest
plant life that is propagated by invisible spores.That the microscope
does not reveal these spores or germs proves nothing, for the strongest
microscope in the world has not begun to reach the final atom of which
matter is composed.Indeed, it would seem to be as limited in its power
to explore the infinitely little and near as the telescope to reveal the
infinitely distant and great.Up to this time science has discovered
nothing to contravene the assurance that God, or some one, 'created every
living creature that moveth, and every herb yielding seed after his
kind.'After a series of most careful and accurate experiments, Professor
Tyndall could find no proof of the spontaneous production of even
microscopic life, and found much proof to the contrary.How far original
creations are changed or modified by evolution, natural selection, is a
question that is to be settled neither by dogmatism on the one hand, nor
by baseless theories on the other, but by facts, and plenty of them.""Do you think there is anything atheistical in evolution?"his mother
asked, and with some solicitude in her large eyes, for, like all trained
in the old beliefs, she felt that the new philosophies led away into a
realm of vague negations.Webb understood her anxiety lest the faith she
had taught him should become unsettled, and he reassured her in a
characteristic way."If evolution is the true explanation of the world,
as it now appears to us, it is no more atheistical than some theologies I
have heard preached, which contained plenty of doctrines and attributes,
but no God.If God with his infinite leisure chooses to evolve his
universe, why shouldn't he?In any case a creative, intelligent power is
equally essential.It would be just as easy for me to believe that all
the watches and jewelry at Tiffany's were the result of fortuitous causes
as to believe that the world as we find it has no mind back of it."Mother smiled with satisfaction, for she saw that he still stood just
where she did, only his horizon had widened."Well," said his father, contentedly, "I read much in the papers and
magazines of theories and isms of which I never heard when I was young,
but eighty years of experience have convinced me that the Lord reigns."They all laughed at this customary settlement of knotty problems, on the
part of the old gentleman, and Burt, rising from the table, looked out,
with the remark that the prospects were that "the Lord would rain heavily
that afternoon."The oldest and most infallible weather-prophet in the
region--Storm King--was certainly giving portentous indications of a
storm of no ordinary dimensions.The vapor was pouring over its summit in
Niagara-like volume, and the wind, no longer rushing with its recent
boisterous roar, was moaning and sighing as if nature was in pain and
trouble.The barometer, which had been low for two days, sank lower; the
temperature rose as the gale veered to the eastward.This fact, and the
moisture laden atmosphere, indicated that it came from the Gulf Stream
region of the Atlantic.The rain, which began with a fine drizzle,
increased fast, and soon fell in blinding sheets.The day grew dusky
early, and the twilight was brief and obscure; then followed a long night
of Egyptian darkness, through which the storm rushed, warred, and
splashed with increasing vehemence.Before the evening was over, the
sound of tumultuously flowing water became an appreciable element in the
uproar without, and Webb, opening a window on the sheltered side of the
house, called Amy to hear the torrents pouring down the sides of Storm
King."What tremendous alternations of mood Nature indulges in!"she said, as
she came shivering back to the fire."Contrast such a night with a sunny
June day.""It would seem as if'mild, ethereal spring' had got her back up," Burt
remarked, "and regarding the return of winter as a trespass, had taken
him by the throat, determined to have it out once for all.Something will
give way before morning, probably half our bridges.""Well, that _is_ a way of explaining the jar among the elements that I
had not thought of," she said, laughing."You needn't think Webb can do all the explaining.I have my theories
also--sounder than his, too, most of 'em.""There is surely no lack of sound accompanying your theory to-night.Indeed, it is not all'sound and fury!'""It's all the more impressive, then.What's the use of your delicate,
weak-backed theories that require a score of centuries to substantiate
them?""Your theory about the bridges will soon be settled," remarked Leonard,
ominously, "and I fear it will prove correct.At this rate the town will
have to pay for half a dozen new ones--bridges, I mean."There was a heavy body of
snow still in the mountains and on northern <DW72>s, and much ice on the
streams and ponds."There certainly will be no little trouble if this
continues.""Don't worry, children," said Mr."I have generally
found everything standing after the storms were over."CHAPTER XIX

WINTER'S EXIT


The old house seemed so full of strange sounds that Amy found it
impossible to sleep.Seasoned as were its timbers, they creaked and
groaned, and the casements rattled as if giant hands were seeking to open
them.The wind at times would sigh and sob so mournfully, like a human
voice, that her imagination peopled the darkness with strange creatures
in distress, and then she would shudder as a more violent gust raised the
prolonged wail into a loud shriek.Thoughts of her dead father--not the
resigned, peaceful thoughts which the knowledge of his rest had brought
of late--came surging into her mind.Her organization was peculiarly
