But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred
set about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that
should endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute
everything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too
much, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a
little more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period
of above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a
succession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:
save only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according
to Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing
when Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which
are at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as
his own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly
irrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see
Norman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the
usurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about
the rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a
quotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the
purpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments
on the succession of John (i.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but
too long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary
nature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute
of 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always
hath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in
England or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of
their ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers
had read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful
that they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing
the hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised
Statutes, i.176) runs thus:—

“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,
que les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en
Engleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la
mort lour auncestors.”

The object of the statute is something quite different from what any
one would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words
are those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to
make the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea
capable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown
is concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out
of the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,
in the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to
an Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think
that a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter
from the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of
as Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a
single ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in
the case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth
of the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of
representation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not
nearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society
as the doctrine of nearness of kin.No opposition was made to the
accession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong
notion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons
of Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any
thought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were
usurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called
Kyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an
intricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward
the Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had
never been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not
have been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by
another branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and
if he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the
country.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered
any interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le
Roi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,
and he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in
partnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone
after the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King
of the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In
France, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice
was specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an
interregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as
it did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,
the only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of
his father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the
younger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get
something like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the
consent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does
not seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation
during the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case
most like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the
same position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better
position, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal
election on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed
that the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,
should remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,
and in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent
claims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act
has been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England
has been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,
288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing
on the matter.7, the Crown is
entailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then
on the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act
then goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power
and auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by
your letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will
made in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your
onely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this
Realme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne
succede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of
your body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this
Acte, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall
please your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner
forme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and
lymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”
The later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary
and Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts
declaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of
either of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when
the preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his
body lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife
Queen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes
on to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the
Crown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please
his Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of
the body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and
all other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness
daughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully
begotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by
his letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will
in writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,
the same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The
power of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course
remained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his
younger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not
by virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by
which the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it
might have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the
part of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his
father had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary
occupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,
raked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the
Act of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by
legitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,
1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd
Sovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought
to bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
our most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and
that your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and
come of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose
princely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten
after youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the
imperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme
withe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and
preheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee
most fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united
& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &
purposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the
late King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen
Marye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made
in the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king
Henrye theight.”

It should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to
swear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,
was ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown
on the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn
would be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle
the Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an
utter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to
swear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have
to go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course
practically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother
who was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s
birth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with
ordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry
married Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter
of Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be
remembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her
daughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had
nothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of
Katharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde
and affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not
altred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne
of England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes
Majestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament
of Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force
and valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the
Descent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is
the crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said
Soveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly
and expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte
of Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one
particular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire
and Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe
preserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”

This statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the
House of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of
Stewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just
as the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had
been.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was
acknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon
the Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the
Imperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes
Dominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright
and lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste
excellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and
sole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is
worth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of
Parliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of
the Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by
Representation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this
Realm deemed to be personally present.”

(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title
whatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after
his coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is
one of the most remarkable things in our history.294)
remarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of
this defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still
more than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent
rights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the
legislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of
divinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no
opposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language
of James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the
kind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had
that which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the
will of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or
declared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which
in itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late
Queen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”

(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the
King were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being
admitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to
govern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &
by his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the
power committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the
preservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the
Court “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your
predecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I
deny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting
the precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that
he was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected
to the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should
make a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom
of England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of
Charles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part
of the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings
against Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of
the King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son
of James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,
though it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by
it.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the
name of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of
“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname
of an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of
the present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the
Crown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said
princesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke
& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of
the body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of
“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown
was settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on
“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of
Hannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of
happy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”

(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,
something like an assurance to that effect was given by an official
member of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we
read in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House
of Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and
indisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,
wielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the
ministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority
in the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is
characteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its
freedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power
of the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,
and the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper
limits of its own jurisdiction.”

  ὦ δημοκρατία, ταῦτα δῆτ' ἀνασχετά;

Has Mr.Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely
indeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on
“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for
the law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,
having submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the
Ephors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on
to those who came after him would be less than what he had received
from those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς
ὀνειδιζόμενον ὡς ἐλάττω παραδώσοντα τοῖς παισὶ τὴν βασιλείαν, ἢ

the comment, ὅσῳ γὰρ ἂν ἐλαττόνων ὦσι κύριοι, πλείω χρόνον ἀναγκαῖον

τὴν βασιλείαν, ὥστε τρόπον τινὰ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἐλάττονα ἀλλὰ μείζονα
αὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from
Aristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should
be well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an
instance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of
Greece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and
popular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name
of a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian
King exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the
Landammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule
according to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom
according to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal
Republic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss
the comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies
with any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly
fixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages
over republican forms of government, just as republican forms of
government have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether
the people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the
House of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the
polling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,
than they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much
it may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be
removed before the end of its term of office, except on the legal
proof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no
reason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held
to be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the
Established Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows
simple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word
“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do
not find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied
to the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are
just those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or
in present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,
but they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the
country at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics
and to discuss Greek particles; but they have learned nothing from
the treasures of wisdom taught by Grecian history from Herodotus to
Polybios.I have discussed the three chief forms of executive government, the
constitutional King and his Ministry, the President, and the Executive
Council, in the last of my first series of Historical Essays.250:—

MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.“I would
feel like that myself, if I were in their place,” she said, in curt
conclusion.The daughter of the millions sat for a little in pained irresolution.She was conscious of impulses toward anger at the coldness, almost the
rudeness, of this girl whom she had gone far out of and beneath her way
to assist.Her own class-feeling, too, subtly prompted her to dismiss
with contempt the thought of these thick-fingered, uncouth factory-girls
who were rejecting her well-meant bounty.But kindlier feelings strove
within her mind, too, and kept her for the moment undecided.She looked up at Jessica, as if in search for help, and her woman’s
heart suddenly told her that the changes in the girl’s face, vaguely
apparent to her before, were the badges of grief and unrest.All the
annoyance she had been nursing fled on the instant.Her eyes moistened,
and she laid her hand softly on the other’s arm.“_You_ at least mustn’t think harshly of me,” she said with a smile.“That would be _too_ sad.I would give a great deal if the furnaces
could be opened to-morrow--if they had never been shut.Not even the
girls whose people are out of work feel more deeply about the thing
than I do.But--after all, time must soon set that right.Is there nothing I can do for you?”

An answering moisture came into Jessica’s eyes as she met the other’s
look.She shook her head, and withdrew her wrist from the kindly
pressure of Kate’s hand.“I spoke of you at length with Mr.Tracy,” Kate went on, gently.“_Do_
believe that we are both anxious to do all we can for you, in whatever
form you like.You have never spoken about more money for the Resting
House.If it is, don’t hesitate for a
moment to let me know.And mayn’t I go and see the house, now that I am
here?You know I have never been inside it once since you took it.”

For a second or two Jessica hesitated.It cost her a great deal
to maintain the unfriendly attitude she had taken up, and she was
hopelessly at sea as to why she was paying this price for unalloyed
unhappiness.Yet still she persisted doggedly, and as it were in spite
of herself.“It’s a good deal run down just now,” she said.“Since the trouble came,
Lucinda and I haven’t kept it up.You’d like better to see it some time
when it was in order; that is, if I--if it isn’t given up altogether!”

The despairing intonation of these closing words was not lost upon Kate.“Why do you speak like that?” she said.Oh, I hope it isn’t as bad as that!”

“I’m thinking a good deal of going away.You and Miss Wilcox can put
somebody else here, and keep open the house.My
heart isn’t in it any more.”

The girl forced herself through these words with a mournful effort.The
hot tears came to her eyes before she had finished, and she turned away
abruptly, walking behind the counter to the front of the shop.“There is something you are not
telling me, my child,” she urged with tender earnestness._Let_ me help you!”

“There is nothing--nothing at all,” Jessica made answer.“Only I am not
happy here.And there are--other things--that
were a mistake, too.”

“Why not confide in me, dear?Why not let me help you?”

“How could _you_ help me?” The girl spoke with momentary impatience.“There are things that _money_ can’t help.”

The rich young lady drew herself up instinctively, and tightened the fur
about her neck.The words affected her almost like an affront.“I’m very sorry,” she said, with an obvious cooling of manner.“I did
not mean money alone.I had hoped you felt I was your friend.And I
still want to be, if occasion arises.I shall be very much grieved,
indeed, if you do not let me know, at any and all times, when I can be
of use to you.”

She held out her hand, evidently as an indication that she was going.Jessica saw the hand through a mist of smarting tears, and took it, not
daring to look up.She was filled with longings to kiss this hand, to
cry out for forgiveness, to cast herself upon the soft shelter of this
sweet friendship, so sweetly proffered.But there was some strange spell
which held her back, and, still through the aching film of tears, she
saw the gloved hand withdrawn.A soft “good-by” spread its pathos upon
the silence about her, and then Miss Minster was gone.Jessica stood for a time, looking blankly into the street.Then she
turned and walked with unconscious directness, as in a dream, through
the back rooms and across the yard to the Resting House.She had passed
her stepmother, her sister, and her child without bestowing a glance
upon them, and she wandered now through the silent building aimlessly,
without power to think of what she saw.Although the furniture was
still of the most primitive and unpretentious sort, there were many
little appliances for the comfort of the girls, in which she had had
much innocent delight.The bath-rooms on the upper floor, the willow
rocking-chairs in the sitting-room, the neat row of cups and saucers
in the glassfaced cupboard, the magazines and pattern books on the
table--all these it had given her pleasure to contemplate only a
fortnight ago.She noted that the fire in
the base-burner had gone out, though the reservoir still seemed full of
coal.She was conscious of a vague sense of fitness in its having gone
out.The fire that had burned within her heart was in ashes, too.She
put her apron to her eyes and wept vehemently, here in solitude.Lucinda came out, nearly an hour later, to find her sister sitting
disconsolate by the fireless stove, shivering with the cold, and staring
into vacancy.She put her broad arm with maternal kindness around Jessica’s waist, and
led her unresisting toward the door.“Never mind, sis,” she murmured,
with clumsy sympathy.“Come in and play with Horace.”

Jessica, shuddering again with the chill, buried her face on her
sister’s shoulder, and wept supinely.There was not an atom of courage
remaining in her heart.“You are low down and miserable,” pursued Lucinda, compassionately.“I’ll make you up some boneset tea.It’ll be lucky if you haven’t caught
your death a-cold out here so long.” She had taken a shawl, which hung
in the hallway, and wrapped it about her sister’s shoulders.“I half wish I had,” sobbed Jessica.“There’s no fight left in me any
more.”

“What’s the matter, anyway?”

“If I knew myself,” the girl groaned in answer, “perhaps I could do
something; but I don’t.I can’t think, I can’t eat or sleep or work.what is the matter with me?”




CHAPTER XXXI.--A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.A SOMBRE excitement reigned in Thessaly next day, when it became known
that the French-Cana-dian workmen whom the rolling-mill people were
importing would arrive in the village within the next few hours.They
were coming through from Massachusetts, and watchful eyes at Troy had
noted their temporary halt there and the time of the train they took
westward.The telegraph sped forward the warning, and fully a thousand
idle men in Thessaly gathered about the dépôt, both inside and on the
street without, to witness the unwelcome advent.Some indefinite rumors of the sensation reached the secluded milliner’s
shop on the back street, during the day.Ben Lawton drifted in to warm
himself during the late forenoon, and told of the stirring scenes that
were expected.He was quick to observe that Jessica was not looking
well, and adjured her to be careful about the heavy cold which she said
she had taken.The claims upon him of the excitement outside were too
strong to be resisted, but he promised to look in during the afternoon
and tell them the news.The daylight of the November afternoon was beginning imperceptibly
to wane before any further tidings of the one topic of great public
interest reached the sisters.One of the better class of factory-girls
came in to gossip with Lucinda, and she brought with her a veritable
budget of information.The French Canadians had arrived, and with them
came some Pinkerton detectives, or whatever they were called, who were
said to be armed to the teeth.The crowd had fiercely hooted these
newcomers and their guards, and there had been a good deal of angry
hustling.For awhile it looked as if a fight must ensue; but, somehow,
it did not come off.The Canadians, in a body, had gone with their
escort to the row of new cottages which the company had hired for them,
followed by a diminishing throng of hostile men and boys.There were
numerous personal incidents to relate, and the two sisters listened with
deep interest to the whole recital.When it was finished the girl still sat about, evidently with something
on her mind.At last, with a blunt “Can I speak to you for a moment?”
 she led Jessica out into the shop.There, in a whisper, with repeated
affirmations and much detail, she imparted the confidential portion of
her intelligence.The effect of this information upon Jessica was marked and immediate.As soon as the girl had gone she hastened to the living-room, and began
hurriedly putting on her boots.The effort of stooping to button them
made her feverish head ache, and she was forced to call the amazed
Lucinda to her assistance.“You’re crazy to think of going out such a day as this,” protested the
girl, “and you with such a cold, too.”

“It’s got to be done,” said Jessica, her eyes burning with eagerness,
and her cheeks flushed.“If it killed me, it would have to be done.But
I’ll bundle up warm.I’ll be all right.” Refusing
to listen to further dissuasion she hastily put on her hat and cloak,
and then with nervous rapidity wrote a note, sealed it up tightly with
an envelope, and marked on it, with great plainness, the address: “Miss
Kate Minster.”

“Give this to father when he comes,” she cried, “and tell him--”

Ben Lawton’s appearance at the door interrupted the directions.He was
too excited about the events of the day to be surprised at seeing the
daughter he had left an invalid now dressed for the street; but she
curtly stopped the narrative which he began.“We’ve heard all about it,” she said.“I want you to come with me now.”

Lucinda watched the dominant sister drag on and button her gloves with
apprehension and solicitude written all over her honest face.“Now, do
be careful,” she repeated more than once.As Jessica said “I’m ready now,” and turned to join her father, the
little boy came into the shop through the open door of the living-room.A swift instinct prompted the mother to go to him and stoop to kiss him
on the forehead.The child smiled at her; and when she was out in
the street, walking so hurriedly that her father found the gait
unprecedented in his languid experience, she still dwelt curiously in
her mind upon the sweetness of that infantile smile.And this, by some strange process, suddenly brought clearness and order
to her thoughts.Under the stress of this nervous tension, perhaps
because of the illness which she felt in every bone, yet which seemed to
clarify her senses, her mind was all at once working without confusion.She saw now that what had depressed her, overthrown her self-control,
impelled her to reject the kindness of Miss Minster, had been the
humanization, so to speak, of her ideal, Reuben Tracy.The bare thought
of his marrying and giving in marriage--of his being in love with the
rich girl--this it was that had so strangely disturbed her.Looking at
it now, it was the most foolish thing in the world.What on earth had
she to do with Reuben Tracy?There could never conceivably have entered
her head even the most vagrant and transient notion that he--no, she
would not put _that_ thought into form, even in her own mind.And were
there two young people in all the world who had more claim to her good
wishes than Reuben and Kate?She answered this heartily in the negative,
and said to herself that she truly was glad that they loved each other.She bit her lips, and insisted on repeating this to
her own thoughts.But why, then, had the discovery of this so unnerved her?It must have been because the idea of their
happiness made the isolation of her own life so miserably clear; because
she felt that they had forgotten her and her work in their new-found
concern for each other.She was all over
that weak folly now.She had it in her power to help them, and dim,
half-formed wishes that she might give life itself to their service
flitted across her mind.She had spoken never a word to her father all this while, and had seemed
to take no note either of direction or of what and whom she passed; but
she stopped now in front of the doorway in Main Street which bore the
law-sign of Reuben Tracy.“Wait for me here,” she said to Ben, and
disappeared up the staircase.Jessica made her way with some difficulty up the second flight.Her head
burned with the exertion, and there was a novel numbness in her limbs;
but she gave this only a passing thought.On the panel was tacked a white
half-sheet of paper.It was not easy to decipher the inscription in the
failing light, but she finally made it out to be:

“_Called away until noon to-morrow (Friday)_.”

The girl leaned against the door-sill for support.In the first moment
or two it seemed to her that she was going to swoon.Then resolution
came back to her, and with it a new store of strength, and she went down
the stairs again slowly and in terrible doubt as to what should now be
done.The memory suddenly came to her of the one other time she had been in
this stairway, when she had stood in the darkness with her little boy,
gathered up against the wall to allow the two Minster ladies to pass.Upon the heels of this chased the recollection--with such lack of
sequence do our thoughts follow one another--of the singularly sweet
smile her little boy had bestowed upon her, half an hour since, when she
kissed him.The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture.Walking down
the stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her
all at once--it was his father’s smile!Yes, yes--hurriedly the fancy
reared itself in her thoughts--thus the lover of her young girlhood had
looked upon her.The delicate, clever face; the prettily arched lips;
the soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming blue
eyes--all were the same.very often--this resemblance had forced itself upon her
consciousness before.But now, lighted up by that chance babyish smile,
it came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain fascination
in it.John went to the bedroom.Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this almost
pleasant thought had entered it.It was passing strange, she felt, that
any sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed
her soul upon bitterness for so long a time.Yet it was already on the
instant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think,
that old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always
presented before.At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and
discussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who
carried a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation
to exist.Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter
she had written at the shop.“I want you to take this at once to Miss
Minster, at her house,” she said, hurriedly.“See to it that she gets it
herself.Don’t say a word to any living
soul.I’ve said you can be depended
upon.If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune.Now, hurry;
and I do hope you will do me credit!”

Under the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with
unexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom
he borrowed some chewing tobacco.The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion
of her mind.It had appeared to be important to send her father away at
once, but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her
in her search.For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.How to go to work to trace him she did not know.She had no notion
whatever as to who his intimate friends were.The best device she could
think of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she
had heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another
in court, they were all on very good terms outside.Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another
stairway which bore a number of lawyers’ signs.The windows all up the
front of this building were lighted, and without further examination she
ascended the first flight of stairs.The landing was almost completely
dark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or
four doors close about her.She knocked on one of these at random, and
in response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door
and entered.It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with
a long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light
leather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the
chamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the
desk, and his head in his hands.The shaded light in front of him made a
mellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl’s breast as she
looked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of
the voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled
it.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.This was
Horace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of
self-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,
then, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with
the other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged
her nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle
processes, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might
a hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and
stood looking at’ him motionless and mute.What is wanted?” he called out, querulously, without
changing his posture.It was as if a magic voice drew her
forward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,
and swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the
features of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose
hesitatingly to his feet.“Excuse me,” he mumbled, “I was busy with my thoughts, and did not know
who it was.”

“Do you know now?” Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy
warmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on
her face.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let
his arms fall limp at his sides.“In the name of the dev--” he began, confusedly, and then bit the word
short, and stared at her again.“Is it really you?” he asked at last,
reassured in part by her smile.“Are you sorry to see me?” she asked in turn.Her mind could frame
nothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He
turned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight
detour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the
dark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key
in the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock
it again.“Why, no; why should I be?” he said in a more natural voice, as he
returned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more
difficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he
studied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.“Come and sit down here,” he said, after a few moments of this puzzled
inspection, and resumed his own chair.“I want a good look at you,” he
explained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it
required an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the
changes in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything
else from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,
and bent over him at a diffident distance.As she did so, she had the
feeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years
had dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.“Why, Horace, your hair is quite gray!” she said, as if the fact
contained the sublimation of pathos.“There’s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You
don’t know what I’ve been through, my girl,” he said, sadly.The
novel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly
accentuated his sense of deserving compassion.“I am very sorry,” she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and
was gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was
so remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it
from the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses
were no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of
all things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of
this or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from
nobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a
friend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from
those bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her
weary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant
in her sight again.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine
satisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she
so many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon
deliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he
was worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He
looked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There
were heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was
powdered thick with silver.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.“Yes, I am truly sorry,” she said again.“Is it business that has gone
wrong with you?”

“Business--family--health--sleep--everything!” he groaned, bitterly.“It
is literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few
months!”

“I had no idea of that,” she said, simply.Of course it would be
ridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had
comfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.“So help me God, Jess!” he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of
her sympathy, “I’m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and
every woman a fool!”

“There was a long time when _I_ thought that,” she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly
turned his glance away.“Yes, I know,” he answered uneasily, tapping
with his fingers on the desk.“But we won’t talk of that,” she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety
in her tone.“We needn’t talk of that at all.It was merely by accident
that I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was
further from my head than finding you here.”

“Let’s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn’t know you knew him.”

“No, you foolish boy!” she said, with a smile which had a ground tone
of sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was
looking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you
any more.I’ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young
together, and I’m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an
enemy.You don’t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn’t
we two be friends again?I’m not talking of anything else,
Horace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of
our being friends again.”

Horace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.“You’re the best
of the lot, dear old Jess,” he said at last, smiling candidly.“Truly
I’m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough
of despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I’m going to play
that I am out of it.”

Jessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on
his shoulder.“I’m glad I came, too,” she said.“And very soon I want to
see you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.”

“All right, my girl,” he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed
entirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:
“All right.And must you go now?”

“Oh, mercy, yes!” she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.“I had no
business to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--” She vaguely
put together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been
partners, and seemed to be so no longer.“No, you wouldn’t know.”

“Have I so poor a legal reputation as all that?” he said, lightly
smiling.One’s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their
bad opinions.”

“No, it wasn’t about law,” she explained, stum-blingly.“It’s of no
importance.Good-by for the time.”

He would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently
prevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.“Not that,” she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.Daniel travelled to the office.And--good-by, Horace, for the
time.”

He went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might
see her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for
a little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was
undeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only
a half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself
was a refreshing novelty.“A damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!” he mused aloud,
as he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a
dream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an
extremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm
of giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared
to fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and
desponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she
had stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of
self-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a
pained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in
her to weakly dally in Horace’s office when such urgent responsibility
rested upon her outside.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.If the burden of this responsibility appeared
too great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so
strangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her
teeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly
hopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness
for it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she
ought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little
away from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court
observation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her
feverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of
them intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive
whispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find
him!There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this
anguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow
arrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old
“Cal” Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in
the fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed
intently on the sidewalk.He had passed again out of the range of her
cursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and
even some kind of a judge.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she
came up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that
for the moment she could not speak.The ’squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.“Leave me alone, you hussy,” he snarled, “or I’ll lock you up!”

His misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.“Don’t be foolish,”
 she said, hurriedly.“It’s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you
know where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?”

“He don’t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,” was the surly
response.“Be off with you!”

“I told you it was a matter of life and death,” she insisted, earnestly.“He’ll never forgive you--you’ll never forgive yourself--if you know and
won’t tell me.”

The sincerity of the girl’s tone impressed the old man.It was not easy
for him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was
evidently clear enough.“What do you want with him?” he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then
he added, in a reflective undertone: “Cur’ous’t I sh’d want see Tracy,
too.”

“Then you do know where he is?”

“He’s drove out to ’s mother’s farm.Seems word come old woman’s sick.You’re one of that Lawton tribe, aren’t you?”

“If I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?” She asked the
question with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared
vacantly at her: “I ask that because you said you wanted to see him,
that’s all.I shall go alone if you won’t come.He’s _got_ to be back
here this evening, or God only knows what’ll happen!I mean what I say!”

“Do you know the road?” the ’squire asked, catching something of her
own eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.”

“But you won’t tell me what your business is?”

“I’ll tell you this much,” she whispered, hastily.“There is going to
be a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men
told--”

The old ’squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with
fierce energy.“Come on--come on!” he said, hoarsely.“Don’t waste a minute.We’ll gallop the horses both ways.” He muttered to himself with
excitement as he dragged her along.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable
period, while old “Cal” was getting the horses--walking up and down the
path in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily
suffering.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the
terrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an
intolerable hour of torture.There was even the evil chance that the old
man had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the
plank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then
the ’squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of
robes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into
her own hands.“Let me drive,” she said, clucking the horses into a
rapid trot.“I _should_ be home in bed.I’m too ill to sit up, unless
I’m doing something that keeps me from giving up.”

*****

Reuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse
to be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother
Ezra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside
him in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet
on the hearth, and a last week’s agricultural paper on his knee.Ezra
was a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking
at things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the
lawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and
suggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of
keeping down the “fidgets” one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on
whose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra’s wife
had felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed
rest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff
duty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced
old wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o’clock.The kerosene lamp
on the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky
chimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the
over-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned
offensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the
draught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove
and up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility
of its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far
away from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself
wondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys
of energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere
sensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving
none but the Ezras behind.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them
ever came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to
shut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their
own lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly
in Reuben’s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the
Minsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind’s pendulum
separated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and
barren farmhouse room.And he, who had been born and reared in this
latter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single
evening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other
remoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his
revery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright
rubbed them confusedly.“Now I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,” said Reuben, rising.“It
can’t be the doctor this time of night, can it?”

“It ’ud be jest like him,” commented Ezra, captiously.“He’s a great
hand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there’s sickness in
the house.It all goes down in his bill.”

The farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked
heavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some
indistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his
huge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.“Somebody to see you, Rube,” he said.On second thought he added to the
visitor in a tone of formal politeness: “Won’t you step in, ma’am?”

Jessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to
his invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change
into a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She
stood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously
twitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,
she trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,
and fell inertly into Ezra’s big, protecting arm.“I guessed she was going to do it,” said the farmer, not dissembling his
pride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and
holding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.“Hannah keeled over
in that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of
the wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!”

Reuben had hurriedly come to his brother’s assistance.The two men
placed the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began
with anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her
gloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now
almost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her
hands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was
the right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for
the household bottle of brandy.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit
upon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar
scene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then
she smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.“She is an old friend of mine,” whispered Reuben to his brother, as he
pressed the brandy once more upon her.“She’ll come to in a minute.It
must be something serious that brought her out here.”

The girl languidly opened her eyes.“‘Cal’ Ged-ney’s asleep in the
sleigh,” she murmured.“You’d better bring him in.He’ll tell you.”

It was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while
Ezra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her
head sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the
old-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding
the lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until
his brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and
remained outside now to blanket them, while the old ’squire, benumbed
and drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the
young lawyer’s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.“Well, what does this all mean?” he demanded, with vexed asperity.“You’ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!”
 said the ’squire.“Quick--there ain’t a minute to lose!” The old man
almost gasped in his eagerness.“In Heaven’s name, what’s up?Have you been to Cadmus?”

“Yes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of
them to prison fast enough.But that’ll do to-morrow; for to-night
there’s a mob up at the Minster place._Look there!_”

The old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He
held it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the
reflection of a fire.it’s the rolling mill,” ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.“Quite as likely it’s the Minster house; it’s the same direction, only
farther off, and fires are deceptive,” said Gedney, his excitement
rising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.“Tell me about it,” he said, working furiously at the laces.’Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as
he unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.The Lawton
girl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the
Minsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find
Tracy.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in
the sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long
journey from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the
back seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.He knew nothing
more until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a
standstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica
gone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky
behind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,” said Ezra,
coming in as this recital was concluded.“Them horses would a-got their
death out there in another ten minutes.Guess I’d better put ’em in
the barn, eh?”

“No, no!I’ve got to drive them back faster than
they came,” said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.“Hurry, and
get me some thick gloves to drive in.We
won’t wake mother up.I’ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and
let me know how she is.Tell her I _had_ to go.”

When Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the
first time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of
the girl in the rocking-chair.“I’ll get Hannah up,” said the farmer, “and she can have your room.I
guess she’s too sick to try to go back with you.If she’s well enough,
I’ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,
anyway.”

To their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at
these words.“No,” she said; “I feel better now--much better.I really must.” She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though
she was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile
in imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been
“got up” she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and
insisted on having matters ordered otherwise.But the men offered no
dissent.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and
’Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben
impatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.“No; I’d rather be in front with you,” the girl said, when Reuben had
spread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.“Let the Judge sit
there; he wants to sleep.I’m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.”

Thus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,
started the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped
evenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were
excited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was
added to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed
track another sound--the snoring of the ’squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow
of the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy
luminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an
expanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull
reddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A
pleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever
and again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so
grateful to Jessica’s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,
that she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was
growing upon her.“The scoundrels shall pay dear for this,” Reuben said to her, between
set teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be
allowed to walk up hill.“I’m sure I hope so,” she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.“Are you sure you
are bundled up warm enough?” he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe
higher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,” she
answered.“But it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.”

It struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip
once more to the horses: “God only knows what can be done when I do
get there!” It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be
equal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost
disheartening in this confession of self-doubt.“But at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,” he broke out,
angrily, a moment later.“Down to the last pennyweight we will have our
pound of flesh!My girl,” he added, turning to look into her face, and
speaking with deep earnestness, “I never knew what it was before to feel
wholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will
not abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear
that!”

By an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction
within her.“They feel very bitterly,” she ventured to suggest.“It is
terrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families
dependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of
these strange workmen.I suppose that is what--”

Reuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.“I’m not thinking of them,”
 he said.“Poor foolish fellows, I don’t wish them any harm.I only
pray God they haven’t done too much harm to themselves.No: it’s the
swindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are
the ones I’ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.”

The words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke
further: “I don’t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me
to-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all
three of these ruffians to State prison.I haven’t had time to
examine the papers yet, but he says he’s got them in his pocket
there--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about
its original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes
the whole fraud absolutely clear.I’ll go over them to-night, when we’ve
seen this thing through”--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the
reddened sky--“and if tomorrow I don’t lay all three of them by the
heels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!”

“I don’t understand these things very well,” said Jessica.“Who is it
you mean?” It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp
pain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head
ached, too, so violently that she cared very little indeed who it was
that should go to prison tomorrow.“There are three of them in the scheme,” said the lawyer; “as
cold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there’s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a
smart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there’s
Schuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he’s a big hardware
merchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I
never thought of it before!”

Reuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses
now with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit
glance toward his companion.“It’s just occurred to me,” he said.“Curious--I hadn’t given it a
thought.Why, my girl, it’s like a special providence.You, too, will
have your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third
man is Horace Boyce!”

A great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl’s reason as she took in
these words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been
plunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were
still rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the
village.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish
effect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,
and the ’squire was steadily snoring behind them.“You will send them all to prison--surely?” she was able to ask.“As surely as God made little apples!” was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so
terribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her
throbbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an
awful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured
silence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay
hold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,
beyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village
itself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant
had shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.She laid her hand on Reuben’s arm.“If you don’t mind, I’ll change into the back seat,” she said, in a
voice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.“I’m feeling
very ill.It’ll be easier for me there.”

Reuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her
strength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,
and under the robe, into the rear seat.The ’squire was sunk in such a
profound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of
the space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her
with so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed
miraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon
herself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set
herself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which
the old ’squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she
remembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his
coats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,
and gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free
passage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had
discovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes
seemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw
this packet out.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak
to her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of
mind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had
palpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his
drunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man
up again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to
draw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had
gained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost
as heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was
done, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint
and muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be
neither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from
whom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,
however, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed
in the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted
from the sidewalk, in response to Reuben’s questions, sundry leading
facts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office
of the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted
the building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense
crowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had
ever seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,
was what puzzled him.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some
said they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a
“horning.” He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the
rheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as
it was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks
hinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt “Much
obliged,” and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of
the conflagration.The outer walls
of the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing
was left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Daniel went back to the hallway.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the
water-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where
hot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a
report that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of
hose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare
stones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the
streams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash
them into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore
onward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben
deemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng
in the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the
lawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came
therefrom.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and
rough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly
visible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook
old Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.“Hold these lines,” he said, “and wait here for me.--Or,” he turned to
Jessica with the sudden thought, “would you rather he drove you home?”

The girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At
the question she roused herself and shook her head.“No: let me stay
here,” she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to
free his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic
stride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit
upright, and then to rise to her feet.“You’d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn’t come back
right off,” she said to the ’squire.“Where are you going?” Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.“I’ll walk up and down,” she answered, clambering with difficulty out of
the sleigh.“I’m tired of sitting still.”

Once on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a
fence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her
heart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought
which this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon
the Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon
the Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and
gathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful
on-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and
disapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.There
was a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who
were out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys
and young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge
in horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone
up on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks
to the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any
answer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as
night.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to
follow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu
procession had it not been so hopelessly dark.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his
way up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was
offered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only
those immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path
was fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing
there.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a
joke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for
some sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity
of the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered
among them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last
Presidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o’-lantem made of a pumpkin
and elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among
the little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another’s caps,
shouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of
these lads raised the cry of “Here’s the coppers!” and the crowd at
this seemed to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran
across its surface like the wind over a field of corn.This sound was
one less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last
something was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,
placed himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the
head of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a
semblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the
men more readily than ever gave way.At this the other boys with
the torches and jack-o’-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy’s
immediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng
generally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of
the mansion.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,
some of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything
was, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least
visibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were
taken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any
rate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the
platform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered
to a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.This was
a suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the
low-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The
gathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds
that the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.Then there were
admonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the
horn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy’s name was passed from mouth to
mouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer
on the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile
interrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor
these, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.“My friends,” he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his
voice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of “louder!” rose
from the darkness of the central lawn.“He’s afraid of waking the fine ladies,” called out an anonymous voice.“Shut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,” was another shout.“Begorrah, it’s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin’ now!” cried a shrill third
voice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.“My friends,” began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without
immediate interruption, “although I don’t know precisely why you have
gathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to
say to you which I think you will regard as important.I have not seen
the persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily
understand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them
some anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,
will be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this
opportunity of speaking for them to you.If you had not taken this
notion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you
to meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters
over.“First of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened
promptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken
about the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as
the legal representative of two of these women.”

“Yes; they’ll be opened with the Frenchmen!” came a swift answering
shout.“Or will you get Chinamen?” cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: “No man who belongs to Thessaly
shall be crowded out by a newcomer.I give you my word for that, too.”

Some scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised
for the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the
prevalent anxiety to hear more.In this momentary interval Reuben caught
the sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the
front door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new
auditor might be.“Secondly,” he went on, “you ought to be told the truth about the
shutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at
all responsible for either action.I know of my own knowledge that both
things caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond
measure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to
undersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I
want you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your
minds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our
village and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,
for their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster’s memory, deserve
respect and liking at your hands.“I may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in
whom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power
to these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they
deplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called
into the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from
which they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I
have been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can
say with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to
impoverish you will be beaten all along the line.”

This time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When
it died away, some voice called out, “Three cheers for the ladies!” and
these were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o’-lantem boy,
who waved his pumpkin vigorously.“One word more,” called out Tracy, “and I hope you will take in good
part what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,
I was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come
here.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there
would be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,
would be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,
or who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don’t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and
uncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just
because it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one
another’s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a
citizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or
join a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room
for even thought of a riot.Our very strength lies in the idea that we
are our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in
a hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the
notion of coming itself was not American.Beware of men who suggest that
kind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are
puddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the
rest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I
am a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong
to different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented
it, and that that abominable word ‘classes’ could be wiped out of the
English language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if
you feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,
I guess there’s been no harm done by your coming which isn’t more than
balanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you
don’t mind, we’ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be
easier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won’t keep our
neighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.”

Out of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd
at this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:

“Give us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.”

“No, I can’t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of
indictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a
lawyer you’ll find them all there.”

The loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there
was a sustained roar when Tracy’s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many
others called out to him a personal “good-night.” The last of those to
shake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their
steps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had
suddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben’s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been
planned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as
the best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is
always spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded
because the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him
to succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and
bright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn’t a humbug.*****

At the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was
streaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,
and the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great
excitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway
opened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the
servant on the threshold, said: “We want you to come in, Mr.Tracy,” he
turned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort
and a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of
his speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to
all his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of
claret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the
drawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,
so very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears
in his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the
anger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary
years.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through
which he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and
mental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the
beautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones
which wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of
shining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious
recompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow
of death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright
spell by speech.“We heard almost every word of what you said,” Kate was saying.“When
you began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,
Ethel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at
first we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your
voice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have
been---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I’ve heard
you speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,
and lifted the window--and oh!“And from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt
perfectly safe.It doesn’t seem now that we were very much afraid, even
before that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and
that dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the
door-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So
I daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that
made us really nervous.We got that brave girl’s warning about the mob’s
coming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the
blaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--”

“What girl?“Here it is,” answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her
bosom, and reading aloud:

“Dear Miss Minster:

“I have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night
to do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to
do.“Gratefully yours,

“Jessica Lawton.”

Reuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.“I am ashamed of myself,” he said; “I’ve left her out there all this
while.There was so much else that really she
escaped my memory altogether.”

He had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.“You will come back, won’t you?” Kate asked.“There are so many things
to talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will
come.”

With a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the
steps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,
disappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off
as soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her
home, but she refused.She’s a curiously independent girl.”

“I am very sorry,” said Kate.“But I will go over the first thing in the
morning and thank her.”

“You don’t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,”
 put in the lawyer.“I don’t mean that it was so great a thing--my
coming--but she drove all the way out to my mother’s farm to bring me
here to-night, and fainted when she got there.If
her father is still here, I think he’d better go at once to her place,
and see about her.”

The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben
Lawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as
the responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the
hallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank
face.He assented with readiness to Reuben’s idea, when it was explained to
him.“So she druv out to your mother’s place for you, did she?” he commented,
admiringly.“That girl’s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,” he
added, with an apologetic smile, “of the old, old block.I ain’t got so
much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
regular snorter!”

“We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,” said
Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.“Be sure that you tell your
daughter, too, how grateful we all are.”

Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
with formal awkwardness.“I didn’t seem to do much,” he said, deprecatingly, “and perhaps I
wouldn’t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin’
and gougin’ and wras’lin’ round generally.But you can bet your boots,
ma’am, that I’d a-done what I could!”

With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
before.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,
and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.“If you will give me your arm,” she said, in a delicious murmur, “we
will go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us
there.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have
one to-night.”




CHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben’s eyes was like a vista of
fairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold
frames and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,
contributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of
the table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which
fell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and
softened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished
gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues
from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here
which gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,
and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which
can make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or
twice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was
in his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably
his future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted
path--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even
entertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward
to self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and
thereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them
to be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
disconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the
reflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced
breathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd
outside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at
the head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica’s ride, of her
fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this
he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he
had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
morning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
would summarily take.“So far as I can see, Mrs.Minster,” he concluded, when the servant
had again left the room, “no real loss will result from this whole
imbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared
up; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority
interest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not
entirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that
you will come out winner.”

Mrs.“My daughters thought that I knew
nothing about business!” she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the
matter undiscussed.“And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?” asked Ethel,
from Reuben’s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
bitterness had evaporated.“Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
they committed,” he said.“If only as a duty to the public, they should
be prosecuted.”

He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes
met, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:

“Of course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself
with the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I
was full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to
be punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even
tell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage
in settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand
jury.”

“That is a consideration which we won’t discuss,” said Kate.“If my mind
were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
decision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking
a great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce
was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.”

“Yes; I know.” Reuben bowed his head gravely.“Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.”

“No doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
youngster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits
came to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than
them.”

“Precisely,” urged Kate.“Credulous is just the word.He was weak,
foolish, vain--whatever you like.But I
don’t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,”
 the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, “to be frank, there are
reasons for my thinking so.”

Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
mirrored that feeling in his glance.“I quite follow you,” he said.“It is my notion that he was deceived, at
the beginning.”

“Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,” responded
Kate.“And that is why,” put in Ethel, “we feel like asking you not to take
the matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would
be too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,
and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange
Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into
prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down
on a treadmill.No; we mustn’t do that, Mr.Tracy.”

Kate added musingly: “He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
can we not?”

Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except “yes.”
 His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover’s interpretation of this
speech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words
about allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a
final decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the
table knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the
atmosphere grew lighter.“And now for the real thing,” said Kate, gayly.“I am commissioned on
behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our
rescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in
the library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were
in such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn’t tell her when you
began--but she couldn’t help hearing the horns, and she is as much
obliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!”

“Yes, indeed,” assented Mrs.“I don’t know where the police
were, at all.”

“The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been
here,” said Reuben.“The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and
discreditable in its way, but I don’t really imagine there was ever any
actual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works
and the importation of the French Canadians, and I don’t blame them;
but as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is
that the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve
in frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn’t know
what to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn’t an American
institution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals
to reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they
were quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.”

“Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
promptly,” said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: “Yes, Mrs.And so they must
be opened, on Monday.It is my dearest
wish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to
make a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we
should defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it
can.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and
who can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not
dare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian
of your interests quite as much as of your daughters’.I am very proud
and happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for
acting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot
now be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.”

“Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,” said Ethel,
merrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
considerable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
brought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,
was gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There
had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt
that he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that
were past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to
minister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of
attention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the
family had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy
had surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary
to keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one
another, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent
than spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world
had shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened
light was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,
of romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it
was centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark
upon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of
smiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely
prompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone
away, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He
held her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed
his lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect
again, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel’s
face, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal
dreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,
trembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
the path to the street.bless you!” was what the song-birds
carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
said, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
progress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was
there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
universe?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air
was colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
winter.To the lover’s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked
themselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward
glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
onward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****

At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
which lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama
spread overhead.John travelled to the bathroom.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his
cane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and
his brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
passed, “Hello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn’t it?” and had only
an inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories
of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and
General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That
Horace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only
too evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal
roof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but
indulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and
quip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him
like a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful
weakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and
to their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked
disgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but
winks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when
he came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very
vagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
which encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily
noted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the
snow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out
late.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which
gave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,
obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
arms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an
instant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped
it, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the
reverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,
unlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up
the gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very
ill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
Dr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--“I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!”

 Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed
by stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet
volatile sense of comfort.Jessica’s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
gigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no
impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it
finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
understanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness
before her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves
gradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still
downward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted
lily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely
apparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered
over these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came
through them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at
its disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her
dim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed
weeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her
was the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending
from it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at
it.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at
all.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of
a man’s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,
and thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not
to be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light
flashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She
knew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised
that he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about
things, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and
did not dream of speaking.“Are you better?” she heard him eagerly whisper.“Are you in pain?”

The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
troubled her remotely.She made some faint nodding motion of her head
and eyes, and then lay perfectly still again.She could hear the sound
of her own breathing--a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through
a comb--and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
heavy ache in her breast.Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
remembering things.The pictures came slowly, taking form with a
fantastic absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced
the effect of a recollection upon her mind.The starting point--and
everything else that went before that terrible sinking, despairing
struggle through the wet snow--was missing.She recalled most vividly
of all being seized with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness
and choking--her throat and chest all afire with the tortures of
suffocation.It was under a lamp-post, she remembered; and when the
vehement coughing was over, her mouth was full of blood, and there were
terrifying crimson spatters on the snow.She had stood aghast at this,
and then fallen to weeping piteously to herself with fright.How strange
it was--in the anguish of that moment she had moaned out, “O mother,
mother!” and yet she had never seen that parent, and had scarcely
thought of her memory even for many, many years.Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing
like leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart.She had
fallen in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
blackness and collapse.She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at
recollection had caused.Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided,
to a dream of the buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow
like the stertorous sound of her own breathing.The bee--a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
back and thighs--had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit enough
to go out again.Some of the children were giggling over this, but
she would not join them because Mr.Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
platform, did not wish it.Already
she delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of
the other girls--scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
have.Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains
tricked out with imitation garlands.They were worn now by older
girls--hard-faced, jealous, cruel creatures--and these sat in a room
with lace curtains and luxurious furniture.And some laughed with a ring
like brass in their voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some
cursed their God and all living things; and there was the odor of wine
and the uproar of the piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and
terror.Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil
fangs of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened
ears, led to a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting
sun spread a red light among the big tree-trunks.Against this deep,
far-distant sky there was the figure of a man coming.For him she waited
with a song in her heart.It was Reuben Tracy, and
he was too gentle and good not to see her when he passed.She would call
out to him--and lo!Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with
terrified longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him
