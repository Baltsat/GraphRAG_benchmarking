The tavern was deserted save for a few stragglers.Under the dim light
at the bar Mr.Lincoln took off his hat and drew the Judge's letter from
the lining.Stephen," said he, "would you like to come to Freeport with me
to-morrow and hear the debate?"An hour earlier he would have declined with thanks.Now his
face lighted at the prospect, and suddenly fell again.He laid his hand on the young man's shoulder, and
laughed."I reckon you're thinking of what the Judge will say.""I'll take care of the Judge," said Mr.He drew forth from the inexhaustible hat a slip of paper, and
began to write."There," said he, when he had finished, "a friend of mine is going to
Springfield in the morning, and he'll send that to the Judge."And this is what he had written:--

     "I have borrowed Steve for a day or two, and guarantee
     to return him a good Republican.It is worth remarking that this was the first time Mr.Brice had been
called "Steve" and had not resented it.Lincoln, but that
gentleman's quizzical look cut him short.And the next remark made him
gasp."Look here, Steve," said he, "you know a parlor from a drawing-room.What did you think of me when you saw me to-night?"Stephen blushed furiously, and his tongue clave to the roof of his
mouth.Lincoln, with his characteristic smile, "you
thought that you wouldn't pick me out of a bunch of horses to race with
the Senator."THE QUESTION

Many times since Abraham Lincoln has been called to that mansion which
God has reserved for the patriots who have served Him also, Stephen
Brice has thought of that steaming night in the low-ceiled room of the
country tavern, reeking with the smell of coarse food and hot humanity.He remembers vividly how at first his gorge rose, and recalls how
gradually there crept over him a forgetfulness of the squalidity and
discomfort.Then the
dawning of a worship for a very ugly man in a rumpled and ill-made coat.You will perceive that there was hope for Stephen.On his shake-down
that night, oblivious to the snores of his companions and the droning of
the insects, he lay awake.And before his eyes was that strange, marked
face, with its deep lines that blended both humor and sadness there.It
was homely, and yet Stephen found himself reflecting that honesty was
just as homely, and plain truth.And yet both were beautiful to those
who had learned to love them.He fell asleep wondering why Judge Whipple had sent him.It was in accord with nature that reaction came with the morning.Such a
morning, and such a place!He was awakened, shivering, by the beat of rain on the roof, and
stumbling over the prostrate forms of the four Beaver brothers, reached
the window.Clouds filled the sky, and Joshway, whose pallet was under
the sill, was in a blessed state of moisture.No wonder some of his enthusiasm had trickled away!He made his toilet in the wet under the pump outside; where he had to
wait his turn.And he rather wished he were going back to St.He had an early breakfast of fried eggs and underdone bacon, and coffee
which made him pine for Hester's.The dishes were neither too clean nor
too plentiful, being doused in water as soon as ever they were out of
use.But after breakfast the sun came out, and a crowd collected around the
tavern, although the air was chill and the muck deep in the street.Lincoln towering above the knots of
country politicians who surrounded him, and every once in a while a knot
would double up with laughter.There was no sign that the senatorial
aspirant took the situation seriously; that the coming struggle with
his skilful antagonist was weighing him down in the least.Stephen held
aloof from the groups, thinking that Mr.Louis on the morning train, and was even
pushing toward the tavern entrance with his bag in his hand, when he was
met by Mr."I had about given you up, Mr.Lincoln asked me to
get hold of you, and bring you to him alive or dead."Accordingly Stephen was led to the station, where a long train of twelve
cars was pulled up, covered with flags and bunting.On entering one of
these, he perceived Mr.Lincoln sprawled (he could think of no other
word to fit the attitude) on a seat next the window, and next him was
Mr.The seat just in front was reserved
for Mr.Sandra went back to the kitchen.Hill, who was to make any notes necessary.His appearance was even less attractive than the night before, as he
had on a dirty gray linen duster."I thought you'd got loose, Steve," he said, holding out his hand.Just you sit down there next to Bob, where I can talk to
you."Stephen sat down, diffident, for he knew that there were others in that
train who would give ten years of their lives for that seat."I've taken a shine to this Bostonian, Joe," said Mr Lincoln to Mr."We've got to catch 'em young to do anything with 'em, you know.Now, Steve, just give me a notion how politics are over in St.What do they think of our new Republican party?Lincoln seemed to feel Medill's objections, as by mental telepathy.But
he said:-- "We'll come to that little matter later, Joe, when the cars
start."But under the influence of that
kindly eye he thawed, and forgot himself.He felt that this man was
not one to feign an interest.The shouts of the people on the little
platform interrupted the account, and the engine staggered off with its
load.Louis is a nest of Southern Democrats," Mr.Lincoln
remarked, "and not much opposition.""There are quite a few Old Line Whigs, sir," ventured Stephen, smiling.Lincoln, "did you ever hear Warfield's definition of an
Old Line Whig?""A man who takes his toddy regularly, and votes the Democratic ticket
occasionally, and who wears ruffled shirts."Both of these gentlemen laughed, and two more in the seat behind, who
had an ear to the conversation."But, sir," said Stephen, seeing that he was expected to go on, "I think
that the Republican party will gather a considerable strength there in
another year or two.We have the material for powerful leaders in Mr."We are getting an
ever increasing population from New England, mostly of young men who
will take kindly to the new party."And then he added, thinking of
his pilgrimage the Sunday before: "South St.Louis is a solid mass of
Germans, who are all antislavery.But they are very foreign still, and
have all their German institutions.""Then they will the more easily be turned into soldiers if the time
should come," said Mr.And he added quickly, "I pray that it
may not."Stephen had cause to remember that observation, and the acumen it
showed, long afterward.The train made several stops, and at each of them shoals of country
people filled the aisles, and paused for a most familiar chat with the
senatorial candidate.His appearance was the equal
in roughness to theirs, his manner if anything was more democratic,--yet
in spite of all this Stephen in them detected a deference which might
almost be termed a homage.Had our
friend been older, he might have known that the presence of good women
in a political crowd portends something.He
was destined to be still more surprised that day.When they had left behind them the shouts of the little down of Dixon,
Mr.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Lincoln took off his hat, and produced a crumpled and not too
immaculate scrap of paper from the multitude therein."Now, Joe," said he, "here are the four questions I intend to ask Judge
Douglas."We don't care anything about the others," answered Mr.If you ask that second one, you'll never see the United
States Senate.""And the Republican party in this state will have had a blow from which
it can scarcely recover," added Mr.His eyes were far away over the
wet prairie.But neither he, nor Medill, nor Judd, nor Hill
guessed at the pregnancy of that moment.How were they to know that
the fate of the United States of America was concealed in that
Question,--was to be decided on a rough wooden platform that day in the
town of Freeport, Illinois?But Abraham Lincoln, the uncouth man in the linen duster with the
tousled hair, knew it.And the stone that was rejected of the builders
was to become the corner-stone of the temple.Lincoln recalled himself, glanced at the paper, and cleared
his throat.In measured tones, plainly heard above the rush and roar of
the train, he read the Question:

   "Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?""Abe," said he, solemnly, "Douglas will answer yes, or equivocate, and
that is all the assurance these Northern Democrats want to put Steve
Douglas in the Senate.Medill, reflecting the sheer astonishment of the
others; "then why the devil are you wearing yourself out?And why are we
spending our time and money on you?"Lincoln laid his hand on Medill's sleeve."Joe," said he, "a rat in the larder is easier to catch than a rat
that has the run of the cellar.You know, where to set your trap in the
larder.I'll tell you why I'm in this campaign: to catch Douglas now,
and keep him out of the White House in 1860.To save this country of
ours, Joe.There was a silence, broken by two exclamations."But see here, Abe," said Mr.Medill, as soon as ever he got his breath,
"what have we got to show for it?"Nowhere, I reckon," he answered simply."You mean to say, as the candidate of the Republican party, you don't
care whether you get to the Senate?""Not if I can send Steve Douglas there with his wings broken," was the
calm reply."Suppose he does answer yes, that slavery can be excluded?"Lincoln, "then Douglas loses the vote of the great
slave-holders, the vote of the solid South, that he has been fostering
ever since he has had the itch to be President.Without the solid South
the Little Giant will never live in the White House.And unless I'm
mightily mistaken, Steve Douglas has had his aye as far ahead as 1860
for some time."There was a stout man standing in
the aisle, and he spat deftly out of the open window."You may wing Steve Douglas, Abe," said he, gloomily, "but the gun will
kick you over the bluff.""Don't worry about me, Ed," said Mr.In a wave of comprehension the significance of all this was revealed to
Stephen Brice, The grim humor, the sagacious statesmanship, and (best of
all)--the superb self sacrifice of it, struck him suddenly.I think it
was in that hour that he realized the full extent of the wisdom he was
near, which was like unto Solomon's.Shame surged in Stephen's face that he should have misjudged him.And in after years, when
he thought of this new vital force which became part of him that day,
it was in the terms of Emerson: "Pythagoras was misunderstood, and
Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and
Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.How many have conversed with Lincoln before and since, and knew him not!Lincoln's greatness were
needed,--he had chosen to speak to them in homely parables.The story of
Farmer Bell was plain as day.Jim Rickets, who had life all his own way,
was none other than Stephen A. Douglas, the easily successful.The ugly
galoot, who dared to raise his eyes only to the pear, was Mr.And the pear was the Senatorship, which the galoot had denied
himself to save Susan from being Mr.Stephen could understand likewise the vehemence of the Republican
leaders who crowded around their candidate and tried to get him to
retract that Question.He listened quietly, he answered with a patient
smile.Now and then he threw a story into the midst of this discussion
which made them laugh in spite of themselves.The hopelessness of the
case was quite plain to Mr.Hill, who smiled, and whispered in Stephen's
ear: "He has made up his mind.They will not budge him an inch, and they
know it."Lincoln took the scrap of paper, which was even more dirty
and finger-marked by this time, and handed it to Mr.The train
was slowing down for Freeport.In the distance, bands could be heard
playing, and along the track, line upon line of men and women were
cheering and waving.It was ten o'clock, raw and cold for that time of
the year, and the sun was trying to come out.Lincoln, "be sure you get that right in your notes.And,
Steve, you stick close to me, and you'll see the show.Why, boys," he
added, smiling, "there's the great man's private car, cannon and all."All that Stephen saw was a regular day-car on a sidetrack.A brass
cannon was on the tender hitched behind it.CHAPTER V. THE CRISIS

Stephen A. Douglas, called the Little Giant on account of his intellect,
was a type of man of which our race has had some notable examples,
although they are not characteristic.Capable of sacrifice to their
country, personal ambition is, nevertheless, the mainspring of their
actions.They must either be before the public, or else unhappy.This
trait gives them a large theatrical strain, and sometimes brands them as
adventurers.Their ability saves them from being demagogues.In the case of Douglas, he had deliberately renewed some years before
the agitation on the spread of slavery, by setting forth a doctrine of
extreme cleverness.This doctrine, like many others of its kind, seemed
at first sight to be the balm it pretended, instead of an irritant, as
it really was.It was calculated to deceive all except thinking men, and
to silence all save a merciless logician.And this merciless logician,
who was heaven-sent in time of need, was Abraham Lincoln.Douglas was a juggler, a political prestidigitateur.He did things
before the eyes of the Senate and the nation.His balm for the healing
of the nation's wounds was a patent medicine so cleverly concocted that
experts alone could show what was in it.So abstruse and twisted were
some of Mr.Douglas's doctrines that a genius alone might put them into
simple words, for the common people.The great panacea for the slavery trouble put forth by Mr.Douglas
at that time was briefly this: that the people of the new territories
should decide for themselves, subject to the Constitution, whether they
should have slavery or not, and also decide for themselves all other
questions under the Constitution.Douglas, there was
the famous Dred Scott decision, which had set the South wild with joy
the year before, and had cast a gloom over the North.The Chief Justice
of the United States had declared that under the Constitution slaves
were property,--and as such every American citizen owning slaves could
carry them about with him wherever he went.Therefore the territorial
legislatures might pass laws until they were dumb, and yet their
settlers might bring with them all the slaves they pleased.He was a gentleman, a strong man, and a
patriot.He was magnanimous, and to his immortal honor be it said that
he, in the end, won the greatest of all struggles.He put down that mightiest thing that was in him,--his ambition for
himself.And he set up, instead, his ambition for his country.He bore
no ill-will toward the man whose fate was so strangely linked to his,
and who finally came to that high seat of honor and of martyrdom which
he coveted.We shall love the Judge, and speak of him with reverence,
for that sublime act of kindness before the Capitol in 1861.Abraham Lincoln might have prayed on that day of the Freeport debate:

"Forgive him, Lord.Lincoln descried the
danger afar, and threw his body into the breach.That which passed before Stephen's eyes, and to which his ears listened
at Freeport, was the Great Republic pressing westward to the Pacific.He
wondered whether some of his Eastern friends who pursed their lips when
the Wrest was mentioned would have sneered or prayed.A young English
nobleman who was there that day did not sneer.He was filled instead
with something like awe at the vigor of this nation which was sprung
from the loins of his own.Crudeness he saw, vulgarity he heard, but
Force he felt, and marvelled.America was in Freeport that day, the rush of her people and the
surprise of her climate.The rain had ceased, and quickly was come out
of the northwest a boisterous wind, chilled by the lakes and scented by
the hemlocks of the Minnesota forests.The sun smiled and frowned Clouds
hurried in the sky, mocking the human hubbub below.Cheering thousands
pressed about the station as Mr.They hemmed
him in his triumphal passage under the great arching trees to the new
Brewster House.The Chief Marshal and his aides, great men before,
were suddenly immortal.The county delegations fell into their proper
precedence like ministers at a state dinner."We have faith in Abraham,
Yet another County for the Rail-sputter, Abe the Giant-killer,"--so the
banners read.Here, much bedecked, was the Galena Lincoln Club, part of
Joe Davies's shipment.Fifes skirled, and drums throbbed, and the stars
and stripes snapped in the breeze.And here was a delegation headed
by fifty sturdy ladies on horseback, at whom Stephen gaped like a
countryman.Then came carryalls of all ages and degrees, wagons from
this county and that county, giddily draped, drawn by horses from one
to six, or by mules, their inscriptions addressing their senatorial
candidate in all degrees of familiarity, but not contempt.What they
seemed proudest of was that he had been a rail-splitter, for nearly all
bore a fence-rail.But stay, what is this wagon with the high sapling flagstaff in the
middle, and the leaves still on it?"Westward the Star of Empire takes its way.The girls link on to Lincoln; their mothers were for Clay."Here was glory to blind you,--two and thirty maids in red sashes and
blue liberty caps with white stars.Each was a state of the Union,
and every one of them was for Abraham, who called them his "Basket of
Flowers."Behind them, most touching of all, sat a thirty-third shackled
in chains.Alas, the men of Kansas was far from being
as sorrowful as the part demanded,--in spite of her instructions she
would smile at the boys.But the appealing inscription she bore, "Set me
free" was greeted with storms of laughter, the boldest of the young men
shouting that she was too beautiful to be free, and some of the old
men, to their shame be it said likewise shouted.But the young men who had
brought their sweethearts to town, and were standing hand in hand with
them, for obvious reasons saw nothing: They scarcely dared to look at
Kansas, and those who did were so loudly rebuked that they turned down
the side streets.During this part of the day these loving couples, whose devotion was so
patent to the whole world, were by far the most absorbing to Stephen.He watched them having their fortunes told, the young women blushing and
crying, "Say!"and the young men getting their
ears boxed for certain remarks.He watched them standing open-mouthed
at the booths and side shows with hands still locked, or again they were
chewing cream candy in unison.Or he glanced sidewise at them, seated in
the open places with the world so far below them that even the insistent
sound of the fifes and drums rose but faintly to their ears.And perhaps,--we shall not say positively,--perhaps Mr.Brice's thoughts
went something like this, "O that love were so simple a matter to all!"But graven on his face was what is called the "Boston scorn."And no
scorn has been known like unto it since the days of Athens.So Stephen made the best of his way to the Brewster House, the elegance
and newness of which the citizens of Freeport openly boasted.Lincoln had preceded him, and was even then listening to a few remarks
of burning praise by an honorable gentleman.Lincoln himself made a
few remarks, which seemed so simple and rang so true, and were so free
from political rococo and decoration generally, that even the young
men forgot their sweethearts to listen.Lincoln went into the
hotel, and the sun slipped under a black cloud.The lobby was full, and rather dirty, since the supply of spittoons was
so far behind the demand.Like the firmament, it was divided into little
bodies which revolved about larger bodies.But there lacked not here
supporters of the Little Giant, and discreet farmers of influence in
their own counties who waited to hear the afternoon's debate before
deciding.These and others did not hesitate to tell of the magnificence
of the Little Giant's torchlight procession the previous evening.Every
Dred-Scottite had carried a torch, and many transparencies, so that
the very glory of it had turned night into day.The Chief Lictor had
distributed these torches with an unheard-of liberality.But there
lacked not detractors who swore that John Dibble and other Lincolnites
had applied for torches for the mere pleasure of carrying them.Since
dawn the delegations had been heralded from the house-tops, and wagered
on while they were yet as worms far out or the prairie.All the morning
these continued to came in, and form in line to march past their
particular candidate.The second great event of the day was the event
of the special over the Galena roar, of sixteen cars and more than a
thousand pairs of sovereign lungs.With military precision they repaired
to the Brewster House, and ahead of then a banner was flung: "Winnebago
County for the Tall Sucker."And the Tall Sucker was on the steps to
receive them.Douglas, who had arrived the evening before to the booming
of two and thirty guns, had his banners end his bunting, too.The
neighborhood of Freeport was stronghold of Northern Democrats, ardent
supporters of the Little Giant if once they could believe that he did
not intend to betray them.Stephen felt in his bones the coming of a struggle, and was
thrilled.Once he smiled at the thought that he had become an active
partisan--nay, a worshipper--of the uncouth Lincoln.Terrible suspicion
for a Bostonian,--had he been carried away?Was his hero, after all, a
homespun demagogue?Had he been wise in deciding before he had taught
a glimpse of the accomplished Douglas, whose name end fame filled the
land?But in his heart there
lurked a fear of the sophisticated Judge and Senator and man of the
world whom he had not yet seen.In his notebook he had made a copy of
the Question, and young Mr.Hill discovered him pondering in a corner
of the lobby at dinnertime.After dinner they went together to their
candidate's room.They found the doors open and the place packed, and
there was Mr.Lincoln's very tall hat towering above those of the
other politicians pressed around him.Lincoln took three strides in
Stephen's direction and seized him by the shoulder."Why, Steve," said he, "I thought you had got away again."Turning to a
big burly man with a good-natures face, who was standing by, he added."Jim, I want you to look out for this young man.Get him a seat on the
stands where he can hear."He never knew what the gentleman's last name
was, or whether he had any.It was but a few minutes' walk to the grove
where the speaking was to be.And as they made their way thither Mr.Lincoln passed them in a Conestoga wagon drawn by six milk-white horses.Jim informed Stephen that the Little Giant had had a six-horse coach.Hovering about the hem of the crowd
were the sunburned young men in their Sunday best, still clinging fast
to the hands of the young women.Bands blared "Columbia, Gem of the
Ocean."Fakirs planted their stands in the way, selling pain-killers
and ague cures, watermelons and lemonade, Jugglers juggled, and beggars
begged.Jim said that there were sixteen thousand people in that grove.He tried to think of himself as
fifty years old, with the courage to address sixteen thousand people on
such a day, and quailed.What a man of affairs it must take to do
that!Sixteen thousand people, into each of whose breasts God had put
different emotions and convictions.He had never even imagined such a
crowd as this assembles merely to listen to a political debate.But then
he remembered, as they dodged from in front of the horses, what it was
not merely a political debate: The pulse of nation was here, a great
nation stricken with approaching fever.It was not now a case of excise,
but of existence.This son of toil who had driven his family thirty miles across the
prairie, blanketed his tired horses and slept on the ground the night
before, who was willing to stand all through the afternoon and listen
with pathetic eagerness to this debate, must be moved by a patriotism
divine.In the breast of that farmer, in the breast of his tired wife
who held her child by the hand, had been instilled from birth that
sublime fervor which is part of their life who inherit the Declaration
of Independence.Instinctively these men who had fought and won the West
had scented the danger.With the spirit of their ancestors who had left
their farms to die on the bridge at Concord, or follow Ethan Allen into
Ticonderoga, these had come to Freeport.What were three days of bodily
discomfort!What even the loss of part of a cherished crop, if the
nation's existence were at stake and their votes might save it!In the midst of that heaving human sea rose the bulwarks of a wooden
stand.The rough
farmers commonly squeezed a way for him.And when they did not, he made
it with his big body.As they drew near their haven, a great surging as
of a tidal wave swept them off their feet.There was a deafening shout,
and the stand rocked on its foundations.Before Stephen could collect
his wits, a fierce battle was raging about him.Abolitionist and
Democrat, Free Soiler and Squatter Sov, defaced one another in a rush
for the platform.The committeemen and reporters on top of it rose to
its defence.Jim was
recognized and hauled bodily into the fort, and Stephen after him.The
populace were driven off, and when the excitement died down again, he
found himself in the row behind the reporters.Hill paused
while sharpening his pencil to wave him a friendly greeting.Stephen, craning in his seat, caught sight of Mr.Lincoln slouched into
one of his favorite attitudes, his chin resting in his hand.But who is this, erect, compact, aggressive, searching with a confident
eye the wilderness of upturned faces?A personage, truly, to be
questioned timidly, to be approached advisedly.Here indeed was a lion,
by the very look of him, master of himself and of others.By reason of
its regularity and masculine strength, a handsome face.A man of the
world to the cut of the coat across the broad shoulders.Here was one
to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation, like a character in a
play, to arouse dreams of Washington and its senators and great men.For
this was one to be consulted by the great alone.A figure of dignity and
power, with magnetism to compel moods.Since, when he smiled, you warmed
in spite of yourself, and when he frowned the world looked grave.The inevitable comparison was come, and Stephen's hero was shrunk once
more.He drew a deep breath, searched for the word, and gulped.How country Abraham Lincoln looked beside Stephen
Arnold Douglas!Had the Lord ever before made and set over against each other two such
different men?Yes, for such are the ways of the Lord.........................

The preliminary speaking was in progress, but Stephen neither heard nor
saw until he felt the heavy hand of his companion on his knee."There's something mighty strange, like fate, between them two," he was
saying."I recklect twenty-five years ago when they was first in the
Legislatur' together.A man told me that they was both admitted to
practice in the S'preme Court in '39, on the same day, sir.Then you
know they was nip an' tuck after the same young lady.They've been in Congress together, the Little Giant in the Senate, and
now, here they be in the greatest set of debates the people of this
state ever heard; Young man, the hand of fate is in this here, mark my
words--"

There was a hush, and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled.A
man, lean, angular, with coat-tail: flapping-unfolded like a grotesque
figure at a side-show.Stooping forward, Abraham Lincoln began to
speak, and Stephen Brice hung his head and shuddered.Could this shrill
falsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning?Could this awkward, yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom
he had worshipped?Ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there, on
the stand and from the crowd.Thrice distilled was the agony of those
moments!But what was this feeling that gradually crept over him?The hands were coming around to the
front.Suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back, with a determined
gesture, the head was raised,--and--and his shame was for gotten.But soon he lost even that, for his mind was
gone on a journey.And when again he came to himself and looked upon
Abraham Lincoln, this was a man transformed.Nay, it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on
those who heard.Now it rose, and again it fell into tones so low as to
start a stir which spread and spread, like a ripple in a pond, until it
broke on the very edge of that vast audience."Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?"It was out, at last, irrevocably writ in the recording book of History,
for better, for worse.Beyond the reach of politician, committee, or
caucus.But what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that
these minutes even now basting into eternity held the Crisis of a nation
that is the hope of the world?Not you, Judge Douglas who sit there
smiling.Consternation is a stranger in your heart,--but answer the
question if you can.Yes, your nimble wit has helped you out of many a
tight corner.You do not feel the noose--as yet.You do not guess that
your reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country.It is not
you who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of Democracy
splitting on the rocks at Charleston and at Baltimore, when the power of
your name might have steered her safely.One by one he is
taking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your
ship.Look, he holds them in his hands without mixing them, and shows
the false construction of its secret parts.For Abraham Lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid
that many a farmer, dulled by toil, heard and understood and marvelled.The simplicity of the Bible dwells in those speeches, and they are now
classics in our literature.And the wonder in Stephen's mind was that
this man who could be a buffoon, whose speech was coarse and whose
person unkempt, could prove himself a tower of morality and truth.That
has troubled many another, before and since the debate at Freeport.That short hour came all too quickly to an end.And as the Moderator
gave the signal for Mr.Lincoln, it was Stephen's big companion who
snapped the strain, and voiced the sentiment of those about him.I didn't think Abe had it in
him."The Honorable Stephen A. Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled
as he rose to reply.As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to
die out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man's should
be.The question seemed not to trouble him in the least.But for Stephen
Brice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even
as Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors,
and left it punily naked.Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as
was the man himself.But he had the head
and shoulders of a lion, and even the lion's roar.What at contrast the
ring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr.If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly
disappointed.As if to show the people
how lightly he held his opponent's warnings, he made them gape by
putting things down Mr.Lincoln's shirt-front and taking them out of his
mouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that
the Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might
lead one to expect.Mary went back to the bathroom.Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at
Freeport?And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his
hearers "Black Republicans.""Not black," came from the crowd again
and again, and once a man: shouted, "Couldn't you modify it and call
it brown?"cried the Judge, and dubbed them "Yankees,"
although himself a Vermonter by birth.He implied that most of these
Black Republicans desired <DW64> wives.But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate
as he was, to get over that without offence to the great South?Very
skillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations.And
then, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might
have been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell.But
tighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length.How were you
to foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol?Had your
sight been long, you would have paused before your answer.Had your
sight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before
the Nation, and you are holding his hat.Judge Douglas, this act alone
has redeemed your faults.It has given you a nobility of which we did
not suspect you.At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so
you left the name of a patriot.Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis
which your craftiness might overcome."It matters not," you cried when you answered the Question, "it matters
not which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract
question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under
the Constitution.The people have the lawful means to introduce or to
exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist
a day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police
regulations."Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the
Freeport Heresy.It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster
House after the debate, found Mr.On his knee, in transports
of delight, was a small boy, and Mr.Lincoln was serenely playing on
the child's Jew's-harp.Standing beside him was a proud father who had
dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to
return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.In a
corner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who
wished to talk about the Question.Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome
that is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished."Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,"
he said.Lincoln," he exclaimed, "you have had no time."Lincoln replied, "and I think that I am
well repaid.Steve," said he, "unless I'm mightily mistaken, you know a
little more than you did yesterday."Didn't you feel sorry for
me last night?""I never shall again, sir," he said.The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went out.In
its stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--the sadness of the
world's tragedies, of Stephen stoned, of Christ crucified."Pray God that you may feel sorry for me again," he said.Awed, the child on his lap was still.Lincoln had kept Stephen's hand in his own."I have hopes of you, Stephen," he said.Why was it that he walked to the station with a
heavy heart?It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was
to be.This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor's cabin
and hoed his neighbor's corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster
and flat-boatman.Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice
around a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt;
rescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who
feared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but
these are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political
mobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers
east and west.This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the
Nation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and
whose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing.So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work
was done, died a martyr.Abraham Lincoln died in His name




CHAPTER VI.GLENCOE

It was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day,
dusty and travel-worn and perspiring.He had come straight from the
ferry, without going home.And he had visions of a quiet dinner with
Richter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about
Abraham Lincoln.But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was
more serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a
smile of welcome."You are a little behind your time, my friend," said he, "What has
happened you?""Ah, I know not," he answered, "He has gone is Glencoe.Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard.The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe.But
he would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the
country yesterday, and orders him.exclaimed Richter, impulsively,
"what wonderful women you have in America!I could lose my head when I
think of Miss Carvel.""Miss Carvel was here, you say?"said Richter, disgusted, "you don't care."And becoming grave again, added: "Except on
Judge Whipple's account.Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?""This morning one of Colonel Carvel's servants came for his letters.I--I pray that he is better," said Richter, his
voice breaking.But he had been conscious all at once of an
affection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself.That
afternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company's to inquire.Hopper said, and added that he "presumed
likely the Colonel would not be in for a week."Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel's sanctum behind the partition,
giving orders to several clerks at the time.He was so prosperous and
important that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who
went away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company's, Eliphalet was too
busy to see him.But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with
orders, told him that the "Jedge was wuss, suh."On Wednesday, there
being little change, Mrs.Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum.On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New
Code, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him.In reply to his
anxious question Ephum answered:

"I reckon he better, suh.He an' de Colonel done commence wrastlin'
'bout a man name o' Linkum.De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh."It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel's compliments, asking
Mr.Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the
Judge might wish to see.And since there was no convenient train in the
evening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr.The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from
the hot and treeless prairies of Illinois.As Stephen alighted at the
little station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel's
buggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and
flowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road.At last they
came to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden
house with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle.And then he saw
the Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar.As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward
the house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him."You are very welcome, sir," he said gravely."The Judge is asleep now,"
he added."I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning,
and my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day.Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr.Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen's bag, and led the way
upstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on
the south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table.After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden
from between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the
railroad upon him, and descended.The Colonel was still on the porch, in
his easy-chair.He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside
him stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint.Colonel Carvel
rose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.Brice," he said, "and I hope you will feel at home
here, sir.Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you
wish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country."Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him
a cigar.He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young
Yankee.The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of
hospitality to a stranger.He talked horse, and no great discernment on
Stephen's part was needed to perceive that this was Mr."I used to have a stable, Mr.Brice, before they ruined gentleman's
sport with these trotters ten years ago.Yes sir, we used to be at
Lexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames
track after that.Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?""Why, sir," he cried, "that very <DW65>, Ned, who drove you here from
the cars-he used to ride Netty Boone.He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track
here.He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one
hundred and a quarter.And I kept him down to that weight a whole year,
Mr.I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with
holes bored in the seat.Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him.Many
a time I took off ten pounds that way.It needs fire to get flesh off a
<DW65>, sir."He didn't notice his guest's amazement."Then, sir," he continued, "they introduced these damned trotting races;
trotting races are for white trash, Mr.I wish you
could have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then.A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted
back, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden.It was so that
these Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and
Yankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they
were ill.Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word.But Virginia turned to
him with perfect self-possession."He has been boring you with his horses, Mr."Has he
told you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and
a quarter?""Has he given you the points of Water Witch and
Netty Boone?""Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this
house.O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced
intolerable.Carvel reached for another cigar asked, "My dear," he asked, "how is
the Judge?""My dear," said Virginia, smiling, "he is asleep.Mammy Easter is with
him, trying to make out what he is saying.He talks in his sleep, just
as you do--"

"And what is he saying?""'A house divided against itself,'" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of
her arm, "'cannot stand.I believe that this Government cannot endure
permanently, half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to
dissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will
cease to be divided.'"No," cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table."Why,"
said he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, "cuss me
if that ain't from the speech that country bumpkin, Lincoln, made in
June last before the Black Republican convention in Illinois."And Stephen was very near it, for
he loved the Colonel.That gentleman suddenly checked himself in his
tirade, and turned to him."I beg your pardon, sir," he said; "I reckon that you have the same
political sentiments as the Judge.Believe me, sir, I would not
willingly offend a guest.""I am not offended, sir," he said.Carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him."You will pardon my absence for a while, sir," he said.In silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through
tall grass, a yellow setter at his heels.The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and
a rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.From a cabin
behind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song.To
the young man, after the burnt city, this was paradise.And then he
remembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in
town, and sighed.Only two years ago she had been at their own place at
Westbury.He looked up, and saw the girl watching him.He dared not think that the
expression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly."I am afraid you are the silent kind, Mr.Brice," said she; "I believe
it is a Yankee trait.""I have known a great many who were not," said he, "When they are
garrulous, they are very much so.""I should prefer a garrulous one," said Virginia."I should think a Yankee were bad enough, but a noisy Yankee not to be
put up with," he ventured.Virginia did not deign a direct reply to this, save by the corners of
her mouth."I wonder," said she, thoughtfully, "whether it is strength of mind or a
lack of ideas that makes them silent.""It is mostly prudence," said Mr."Prudence is our dominant
trait.""You have not always shown it," she said, with an innocence which in
women is often charged with meaning.He would have liked
greatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or
to his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before."We have something left to be thankful for," he answered."We are still
capable of action.""On occasions it is violence," said Virginia, desperately.This man must
not get ahead of her."It is just as violent," said he, "as the repressed feeling which
prompts it."This was a new kind of conversation to Virginia.Of all the young men
she knew, not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort.They were
either flippant, or sentimental, or both.She was at once flattered
and annoyed, flattered, because, as a woman, Stephen had conceded her
a mind.Many of the young men she knew had minds, but deemed that these
were wasted on women, whose language was generally supposed to be a kind
of childish twaddle.Even Jack Brinsmade rarely risked his dignity
and reputation at an intellectual tilt.This was one of Virginia's
grievances.She often argued with her father, and, if the truth were
told, had had more than one victory over Judge Whipple.Virginia's annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in Stephen
a natural and merciless logic,--a faculty for getting at the bottom
of things.His brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local
magnetic influences,--by beauty, for instance.He did not lose his head,
as did some others she knew, at the approach of feminine charms.Here
was a grand subject, then, to try the mettle of any woman.One with
less mettle would have given it up.But Virginia thought it would be
delightful to bring this particular Yankee to his knees; and--and leave
him there.Brice," she said, "I have not spoken to you since the night of my
party."Yes, we did," said he, "and I called, but was unfortunate."Now Miss Carvel was complacency itself."Jackson is so careless with cards," said she, "and very often I do not
take the trouble to read them.""I am sorry," said he, "as I wished for the opportunity to tell you how
much I enjoyed myself.She remembered how, she had opposed his
coning.But honesty as well as something else prompted her to say: "It
was my father who invited you."Stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received."At least you were good enough to dance with me.""I could scarcely refuse a guest," she replied."Had I thought it would have given you annoyance," he said quietly, "I
should not have asked you.""Which would have been a lack of good manners," said Virginia, biting
her lips.Stephen answered nothing, but wished himself in St.He could not
comprehend her cruelty.But, just then, the bell rang for supper, and
the Colonel appeared around the end of the house.It was one of those suppers for which the South is renowned.And when
at length he could induce Stephen to eat no more, Colonel Carvel reached
for his broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat smoking, with his feet against
the mantle.Virginia, who had talked but little, disappeared with a tray
on which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the
Judge.The Colonel regaled Stephen, when she was gone, with the pedigree and
performance of every horse he had had in his stable.And this was a
relief, as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon
Virginia's pronounced attitude of dislike.To him it was inconceivable
that a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have, should
assail him so persistently for freeing a negress, and so depriving her
of a maid she had set her heart upon.There were other New England young
men in society.They were not
her particular friends, to be sure.But they called on her and danced
with her, and she had shown them not the least antipathy.But it was to
Stephen's credit that he did not analyze her further.He was reflecting on these things when he got to his room, when there
came a knock at the door.It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and
apron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh."Is you got all you need, suh?"But Mammy showed no inclination to go, and
he was too polite to shut the door:

"How you like Glencoe, Mistah Bride?""We has some of de fust fam'lies out heah in de summer," said she."But
de Colonel, he a'n't much on a gran' place laik in Kaintuck.Shucks, no,
suh, dis ain't much of a'stablishment!Young Massa won't have no lawns,
no greenhouses, no nothin'.He say he laik it wil' and simple.He on'y
come out fo' two months, mebbe.But Miss Jinny, she make it lively.Las'
week, until the Jedge come we hab dis house chuck full, two-three young
ladies in a room, an' five young gemmen on trunnle beds."Den Miss Jinny low dey all hatter go.She say she a'n't
gwineter have 'em noun''sturbin' a sick man.He
done give the Judge his big room, and he say he and de young men gwine
ober to Mista, Catherwood's.You a'n't never seen Miss Jinny rise up,
suh!She des swep' 'em all out" (Mammy emphasized this by rolling her
hands) "an' declah she gwine ten' to the Jedge herself.She a'n't never
let me bring up one of his meals, suh."And so she left Stephen with
some food for reflection.Virginia was very gay at breakfast, and said that the Judge would see
Stephen; so he and the Colonel, that gentleman with his hat on, went
up to his room.The shutters were thrown open, and the morning sunlight
filtered through the leaves and fell on the four-poster where the Judge
sat up, gaunt and grizzled as ever.He smiled at his host, and then
tried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile."Well, Judge," cried the Colonel, taking his hand, "I reckon we talked
too much.""No such thing, Carvel," said the Judge, forcibly, "if you hadn't
left the room, your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two
minutes."Stephen sat down in a corner, unobserved, in expectation of a renewal.But at this moment Miss Virginia swept into the room, very cool in a
pink muslin."Colonel Carvel," said she, sternly, "I am the doctor's deputy here.I
was told to keep the peace at any cost.And if you answer back, out you
go, like that!"But the Judge, whose mind was on the argument,
continued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon Stephen."Well, sir, well, sir," he said, "you've turned up at last, have you?I send you off with papers for a man, and I get back a piece of yellow
paper saying that he's borrowed you."He took me to Freeport, sir, where I listened to the most remarkable
speech I ever expect to hear."cried the Judge, "so far from Boston?"Stephen hesitated, uncertain whether to laugh, until he chanced to look
at Virginia."I was very much surprised, sir," he said.Whipple, "and what did you chink of that ruffian,
Lincoln?""He is the most remarkable man that I have ever met, sir," answered
Stephen, with emphasis.It seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval.Stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing Mr.Lincoln there,
and he reddened.Virginia's expression bore a trace of defiance, and Mr.Carvel stood with his feet apart, thoughtfully stroking his goatee.Whipple seemed to have no scruples."You must agree with
that laudatory estimation of him which I read in the Missouri Democrat.""I do, sir, most decidedly," he answered."I should hardly expect a conservative Bostonian, of the class which
respects property, to have said that.It might possibly be a good thing
if more from your town could hear those debates.""They will read them, sir; I feel confident of it."At this point the Colonel could contain himself no longer."I reckon I might tell the man who wrote that Democrat article a few
things, if I could find out who he is," said he.But Stephen had turned a fiery red, "I wrote it, Colonel Carvel," he
said.For a dubious instant of silence Colonel Carvel stared.Then--then he
slapped his knees, broke into a storm of laughter, and went out of the
room.He left Stephen in a moist state of discomfiture.The Judge had bolted upright from the pillows."You have been neglecting your law, sir," he cried."I wrote the article at night," said Stephen, indignantly."Then it must have been Sunday night, Mr.At this point Virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled
visibly.Being a woman, whose ways are unaccountable, the older man took
no notice of her.But being a young woman, and a pretty one, Stephen was
angry."I don't see what right you have to ask me that sir," he said.Brice," said the Judge, "Virginia, you
may strike it from the records.And now, sir, tell me something about
your trip."An hour later Stephen descended to the veranda, and it was with
apprehension that he discerned Mr.Carvel seated under the vines at the
far end.To Stephen's surprise the Colonel rose, and, coming toward him, laid a
kindly hand on his shoulder."Stephen," said he, "there will be no law until Monday you must stay
with us until then.I shall have to go by the two o'clock train, I
fear."The Colonel turned to Virginia, who, meanwhile, had sat silently by."Jinny," he said, "we must contrive to keep him.""I'm afraid he is determined, Pa," she answered.Brice
would like to see a little of the place before he goes.It is very
primitive," she explained, "not much like yours in the East."Stephen thanked her, and bowed to the Colonel.And so she led him past
the low, crooked outbuildings at the back, where he saw old Uncle
Ben busy over the preparation of his dinner, and frisky Rosetta, his
daughter, playing with one of the Colonel's setters.Then Virginia took
a well-worn path, on each side of which the high grass bent with its
load of seed, which entered the wood.Oaks and hickories and walnuts
and persimmons spread out in a glade, and the wild grape twisted
fantastically around the trunks.All this beauty seemed but a fit
setting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him.So absorbed was he in contemplation of this, and in wondering whether
indeed she were to marry her cousin, Clarence Colfax, that he did not
see the wonders of view unrolling in front of him.She stopped at length
beside a great patch of wild race bushes.They were on the edge of the
bluff, and in front of them a little rustic summer-house, with seats on
its five sides.But Stephen, going to the edge,
stood and marvelled.Far, far below him, down the wooded steep, shot
the crystal Meramec, chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing
headlong at the deep passes.Beyond, the dimpled green hills rose and fell, and the stream ran indigo
and silver.A hawk soared over the water, the only living creature in
all that wilderness.And when at length he turned,
he saw that the girl was watching him.Virginia had taken other young men here, and they had looked only upon
her.This sincerity now was as new to her
as that with which he had surprised her in the Judge's room.A reply to those simple words of his
was impossible.At honest Tom Catherwood in the same situation she would
have laughed, Clarence never so much as glanced at scenery.Her replies
to him were either flippant, or else maternal, as to a child.A breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair.And with that womanly gesture which has been the same through the ages
she put up her hand; deftly tucking in the stray wisp behind.She glanced at the New Englander, against whom she had been in strange
rebellion since she had first seen him.His face, thinned by the summer
in town, was of the sternness of the Puritan.Stephen's features were
sharply marked for his age.Yet justice
was in the mouth, and greatness of heart.Conscience was graven on the
broad forehead.The eyes were the blue gray of the flint, kindly yet
imperishable.Struggling, then yielding to the impulse, Virginia let herself be led on
into the years.Sanity was the word that best described him.She saw him
trusted of men, honored of women, feared by the false.She saw him in
high places, simple, reserved, poised evenly as he was now."I wish that I might stay," he said regretfully."But I cannot, Miss
Carvel."Never before had she
stooped to urge young men to stay.The difficulty had always been to get
them to go.It was natural, perhaps, that her vanity was wounded.But it
hurt her to think that she had made the overture, had tried to conquer
whatever it was that set her against him, and had failed through him.Perhaps," she added, with a little
laugh, "perhaps it is Bellefontaine Road.""Then" (with a touch of derision), "then it is because you cannot miss
an afternoon's work."I was not always that kind," he answered.But now I have to or--or starve," he said.For the second time his complete simplicity had disarmed her.He had not
appealed to her sympathy, nor had he hinted at the luxury in which he
was brought up.She would have liked to question Stephen on this former
life."I thought him the ugliest man I ever saw, and the handsomest as well.""You believe with him that this government cannot exist half slave and
half free.Brice, when you and I shall be
foreigners one to the other.""You have forgotten," he said eagerly, "you have forgotten the rest
of the quotation.'I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not
expect the house to fall--but cease to be divided.'It will become all
one thing or all the other.""That seemed to me very equivocal," said she."Your
rail-sputter is well named.""Will you read the rest of that speech?"he asked

"Judge Whipple is very clever.He has made a convert of you," she
answered."The Judge has had nothing to do with it," cried Stephen."He is not
given to discussion with me, and until I went to Springfield had never
mentioned Lincoln's name to me."Glancing at her, he surprised a sparkle of amusement in her eyes."Why do you suppose that you were sent to Springfield?""And that most important communication was--your self.There, now, I
have told you," said Virginia."Then you haven't the sense I thought you had," she replied impatiently."Do you know what was in that note?Well, a year ago last June this
Black Republican lawyer whom you are all talking of made a speech before
a convention in Illinois.Judge Whipple has been crazy on the subject
ever since--he talks of Lincoln in his sleep; he went to Springfield and
spent two days with him, and now he can't rest until you have seen and
known and heard him.So he writes a note to Lincoln and asks him to take
you to the debate--"

She paused again to laugh at his amazement."But he told me to go to Springfield!"He knew that you would obey his orders, I
suppose.""But I didn't know--" Stephen began, trying to come pass within an
instant the memory of his year's experience with Mr."You didn't know that he thought anything about you," said Virginia.He has more private charities on his list
than any man in the city except Mr.He
thinks a great deal of you.But there," she added, suddenly blushing
crimson, "I am sorry I told you."She did not answer, but sat tapping the seat with her fingers.And when
she ventured to look at him, he had fallen into thought."I think it must be time for dinner," said Virginia, "if you really wish
to catch the train."The coldness in her voice, rather than her words, aroused him.He rose,
took one lingering look at the river, and followed her to the house.At dinner, when not talking about his mare, the Colonel was trying
to persuade Stephen to remain.Virginia did not join in this, and
her father thought the young man's refusal sprang from her lack of
cordiality.Colonel Carvel himself drove to the station.When he returned, he found his daughter sitting idly on the porch."I like that young man, if he is a Yankee," he declared."I don't," said Virginia, promptly."My dear," said her father, voicing the hospitality of the Carvels,
"I am surprised at you.One should never show one's feelings toward a
guest.As mistress of this house it was your duty to press him to stay.""Do you know why he went, my dear," asked the Colonel."He said that his mother was alone in town, and needed him."Virginia got up without a word, and went into Judge Whipple's room.And there the Colonel found her some hours later, reading aloud from a
scrap-book certain speeches of Mr.Lincoln's which Judge Whipple had cut
from newspapers.And the Judge, lying back with his eyes half closed,
was listening in pure delight.Little did he guess at Virginia's
penance!AN EXCURSION

I am going ahead two years.Two years during which a nation struggled
in agony with sickness, and even the great strength with which she was
endowed at birth was not equal to the task of throwing it off.In 1620
a Dutch ship had brought from Guinea to his Majesty's Colony of Virginia
the germs of that disease for which the Nation's blood was to be let
so freely.During these years signs of dissolution, of death, were not
wanting.In the city by the Father of Waters where the races met, men and women
were born into the world, who were to die in ancient Cuba, who were to
be left fatherless in the struggle soon to come, who were to live to
see new monsters rise to gnaw at the vitals of the Republic, and to
hear again the cynical laugh of Europe.But they were also to see their
country a power in the world, perchance the greatest power.While Europe
had wrangled, the child of the West had grown into manhood and taken
a seat among the highest, to share with them the responsibilities of
manhood.Meanwhile, Stephen Brice had been given permission to practise law
in the sovereign state of Missouri.It cannot be said that he was intimate with that rather
formidable personage, although the Judge, being a man of habits, had
formed that of taking tea at least once a week with Mrs.Stephen
had learned to love the Judge, and he had never ceased to be grateful to
him for a knowledge of that man who had had the most influence upon his
life,--Abraham Lincoln.For the seed, sowed in wisdom and self-denial, was bearing fruit.The
sound of gathering conventions was in the land, and the Freeport Heresy
was not for gotten.We shall not mention the number of clients thronging to Mr.Some of
Stephen's income came from articles in the newspapers of that day.What funny newspapers they were, the size of a blanket!No startling
headlines such as we see now, but a continued novel among the
advertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of
the town, signed Electra.And often a story of pure love, but more
frequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine, or
an anecdote of a cat or a chicken.There were letters from citizens who
had the mania of print, bulletins of different ages from all parts of
the Union, clippings out of day-before-yesterday's newspaper of Chicago
or Cincinnati to three-weeks letters from San Francisco, come by the
pony post to Lexington and then down the swift Missouri.Of course,
there was news by telegraph, but that was precious as fine gold,--not to
be lightly read and cast aside.In the autumn of '59, through the kindness of Mr.Brinsmade, Stephen had
gone on a steamboat up the river to a great convention in Iowa.On this
excursion was much of St.He widened his circle
of acquaintances, and spent much of his time walking the guards between
Miss Anne Brinsmade and Miss Puss Russell.Perhaps it is unfair to these
young ladies to repeat what they said about Stephen in the privacy of
their staterooms, gentle Anne remonstrating that they should not gossip,
and listening eagerly the while, and laughing at Miss Puss, whose
mimicry of Stephen's severe ways brought tears to her eyes.Clarence Colfax was likewise on the boat, and passing Stephen on the
guards, bowed distantly.But once, on the return trip, when Stephen had
a writing pad on his knee, the young Southerner came up to him in his
frankest manner and with an expression of the gray eyes which was not to
be withstood."I hear you are the kind that cannot be
idle even on a holiday.""Not as bad as all that," replied Stephen, smiling at him."Reckon you keep a diary, then," said Clarence, leaning against the
rail.He made a remarkably graceful figure, Stephen thought.He was
tall, and his movements had what might be called a commanding indolence.Stephen, while he smiled, could not but admire the tone and gesture with
which Colfax bade a passing <DW64> to get him a handkerchief from his
cabin.The alacrity of the black to do the errand was amusing enough.Stephen well knew it had not been such if he wanted a handkerchief.Colfax was too well bred to inquire
further; so he never found out that Mr.Brice was writing an account of
the Convention and the speechmaking for the Missouri Democrat."Brice," said the Southerner, "I want to apologize for things I've done
to you and said about you.I hated you for a long time after you beat me
out of Hester, and--" he hesitated.For the first time he actually liked Colfax.He had
been long enough among Colfax's people to understand how difficult it
was for him to say the thing he wished."You may remember a night at my uncle's, Colonel Carvel's, on the
occasion of my cousin's birthday?""Well," blurted Clarence, boyishly, "I was rude to you in my uncle's
house, and I have since been sorry.""He held out his hand, and Stephen took it warmly.Colfax," he said, "and I didn't understand your
point of view as well as I do now.Not that I have changed my ideas," he
added quickly, "but the notion of the girl's going South angered me.I
was bidding against the dealer rather than against you.Had I then known
Miss Carvel--" he stopped abruptly.The winning expression died from the face of the other.He turned away, and leaning across the rail, stared at the high bluffs,
red-bronzed by the autumn sun.A score of miles beyond that precipice
was a long low building of stone, surrounded by spreading trees,--the
school for young ladies, celebrated throughout the West, where our
mothers and grandmothers were taught,--Monticello.Hither Miss Virginia
Carvel had gone, some thirty days since, for her second winter.Perhaps Stephen guessed the thought in the mind of his companion, for
he stared also.The music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause, and only
the tumbling of waters through the planks of the great wheels broke the
silence.They were both startled by laughter at their shoulders.There
stood Miss Russell, the picture of merriment, her arm locked in Anne
Brinsmade's."It is the hour when all devout worshippers turn towards the East," she
said."The goddess is enshrined at Monticello."Both young men, as they got to their feet, were crimson.But this was not
the first time Miss Russell had gone too far.Colfax, with the
excess of manner which was his at such times, excused himself and left
abruptly.This to the further embarrassment of Stephen and Anne, and the
keener enjoyment of Miss Russell."Why, you are even writing
verses to her!""I scarcely know Miss Carvel," he said, recovering."And as for writing
verse--"

"You never did such a thing in your life!Miss Russell made a face in the direction Colfax had taken."He always acts like that when you mention her," she said."But you are so cruel, Puss," said Anne."That has been the way of the world ever since Adam and Eve," remarked
Puss."I suppose you meant to ask: Mr.Brice, whether Clarence is to
marry Virginia Carvel."Brice," Puss continued, undaunted."I shall tell you some
gossip.Virginia was sent to Monticello, and went with her father to
Kentucky and Pennsylvania this summer, that she might be away from
Clarence."Colonel Carvel is right," she went on.They are first cousins, and the Colonel doesn't like that.But he isn't good for anything in the world except horse
racing and--and fighting.He wanted to help drive the Black Republican
emigrants out of Kansas, and his mother had to put a collar and chain on
him.He wanted to go filibustering with Walker, and she had to get down
on her knees.And yet," she cried, "if you Yankees push us as far as
war, Mr."Oh, I know what you are going to say,--that Clarence has money.""Come, Anne," she said, "we mustn't interrupt the Senator any longer.That was the way in which Stephen got his nickname.It is scarcely
necessary to add that he wrote no more until he reached his little room
in the house on Olive Street.They had passed Alton, and the black cloud that hung in the still autumn
air over the city was in sight.It was dusk when the 'Jackson' pushed
her nose into the levee, and the song of the <DW64> stevedores rose from
below as they pulled the gang-plank on to the landing-stage.Stephen
stood apart on the hurricane deck, gazing at the dark line of sooty
warehouses.How many young men with their way to make have felt the same
as he did after some pleasant excursion.The presence of a tall form
beside him shook him from his revery, and he looked up to recognize the
benevolent face of Mr.Brice may be anxious, Stephen, at the late hour," said he."My
carriage is here, and it will give me great pleasure to convey you to
your door."He is in heaven now, and knows at last the good
he wrought upon earth.Of the many thoughtful charities which Stephen
received from him, this one sticks firmest in his remembrance: A
stranger, tired and lonely, and apart from the gay young men and women
who stepped from the boat, he had been sought out by this gentleman, to
whom had been given the divine gift of forgetting none."Oh, Puss," cried Anne, that evening, for Miss Russell had come to spend
the night, "how could you have talked to him so?He scarcely spoke on
the way up in the carriage."Why should I set him upon a pedestal?"said Puss, with a thread in
her mouth; "why should you all set him upon a pedestal?He is only a
Yankee," said Puss, tossing her head, "and not so very wonderful.""I did not say he was wonderful," replied Anne, with dignity.He had better
marry Belle Cluyme.A great man, he may give some decision to that
family."Then--Virginia Carvel is in love with him.""She thinks she hates him," said Miss Russell, calmly.Anne looked up at her companion admiringly.Her two heroines were Puss
and Virginia.Both had the same kind of daring, but in Puss the trait
had developed into a somewhat disagreeable outspokenness which made many
people dislike her.Her judgments were usually well founded, and her
prophecies had so often come to pass that Anne often believed in them
for no other reason."Do you remember that September, a year ago, when we were all out at
Glencoe, and Judge Whipple was ill, and Virginia sent us all away and
nursed him herself?"Brice had gone out, with letters, when the
Judge was better?""It was a Saturday afternoon that he left, although they had begged him
to stay over Sunday.Virginia had written for me to come back, and I
arrived in the evening.I asked Easter where Jinny was, and I found
her--"

"You found her--?"Sitting alone in the summer-house over the river.Easter said she
had been there for two hours.And I have never known Jinny to be such
miserable company as she was that night."But you did," said Anne, with conviction.Miss Russell's reply was not as direct as usual."You know Virginia never confides unless she wants to," she said."Virginia has scarcely seen him since then," she said."You know that
I was her room-mate at Monticello last year, and I think I should have
discovered it."I heard her repeat once what Judge
Whipple told her father of him; that he had a fine legal mind.He was
often in my letters from home, because they have taken Pa's house next
door, and because Pa likes them.I used to read those letters to Jinny,"
said Anne, "but she never expressed any desire to hear them.""I, too, used to write Jinny about him," confessed Puss."No," replied Miss Puss,--"but that was just before the holidays, you
remember.And then the Colonel hurried her off to see her Pennsylvania
relatives, and I believe they went to Annapolis, too, where the Carvels
come from."Stephen, sitting in the next house, writing out his account, little
dreamed that he was the subject of a conference in the third story front
of the Brinsmades'.Later, when the young ladies were asleep, he carried
his manuscript to the Democrat office, and delivered it into the hands
of his friend, the night editor, who was awaiting it.Toward the end of that week, Miss Virginia Carvel was sitting with her
back to one of the great trees at Monticello reading a letter.Every
once in a while she tucked it under her cloak and glanced hastily
around."I have told you all about the excursion, my dear, and how we missed
you.You may remember" (ah, Anne, the guile there is in the best of us),
"you may remember Mr.Stephen Brice, whom we used to speak of.Pa and Ma
take a great interest in him, and Pa had him invited on the excursion.He is more serious than ever, since he has become a full-fledged lawyer.But he has a dry humor which comes out when you know him well, of which
I did not suspect him.His mother is the dearest lady I have ever known,
so quiet, so dignified, and so well bred.Brice told Pa so many things about the
people south of Market Street, the Germans, which he did not know; that
Pa was astonished.He told all about German history, and how they were
persecuted at home, and why they came here.Pa was surprised to hear
that many of them were University men, and that they were already
organizing to defend the Union.I heard Pa say, 'That is what Mr.Blair
meant when he assured me that we need not fear for the city.'"Jinny dear, I ought not to have written you this, because you are for
Secession, and in your heart you think Pa a traitor, because he comes
from a slave state and has slaves of his own."It is sad to think how rich Mrs.Brice lived in Boston, and what she
has had to come to.One servant and a little house, and no place to go
to in the summer, when they used to have such a large one.I often go in
to sew with her, but she has never once mentioned her past to me."Your father has no doubt sent you the Democrat with the account of the
Convention.It is the fullest published, by far, and was so much admired
that Pa asked the editor who wrote it.Who do you think, but Stephen
Brice!Brice hesitated when Pa asked him to go
up the river, and then consented.Yesterday, when I
went in to see Mrs.Brice, a new black silk was on her bed, and as long
as I live I shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said,
'It is a surprise from my son, my dear.I did not expect ever to have
another.'Jinny, I just know he bought it with the money he got for the
article.That was what he was writing on the boat when Clarence Colfax
interrupted him.Puss accused him of writing verses to you."At this point Miss Virginia Carvel stopped reading.Whether she had read
that part before, who shall say?But she took Anne's letter between her
fingers and tore it into bits and flung the bits into the wind, so that
they were tossed about and lost among the dead leaves under the great
trees.And when she reached her room, there was the hated Missouri
Democrat lying, still open, on her table.A little later a great black
piece of it came tossing out of the chimney above, to the affright
of little Miss Brown, teacher of Literature, who was walking in the
grounds, and who ran to the principal's room with the story that the
chimney was afire.THE COLONEL IS WARNED

It is difficult to refrain from mention of the leave-taking of Miss
Virginia Carvel from the Monticello "Female Seminary," so called in the
'Democrat'.Most young ladies did not graduate in those days.Stephen chanced to read in the 'Republican' about these
ceremonies, which mentioned that Miss Virginia Carvel, "Daughter of
Colonel Comyn Carvel, was without doubt the beauty of the day.She
wore--" but why destroy the picture?The words are meaningless to all males, and young women might laugh at
a critical time.Miss Emily Russell performed upon "that most superb of
all musical instruments the human voice."Was it 'Auld Robin Gray' that
she sang?I am sure it was Miss Maude Catherwood who recited 'To My
Mother', with such effect.Miss Carvel, so Stephen learned with alarm,
was to read a poem by Mrs.Browning, but was "unavoidably prevented."The truth was, as he heard afterward from Miss Puss Russell, that
Miss Jinny had refused point blank.So the Lady Principal, to save her
reputation for discipline, had been forced to deceive the press.There was another who read the account of the exercises with intense
interest, a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak.It is to be doubted if
that somewhat easy-going gentleman, Colonel Carvel, realized the
full importance of Eliphalet to Carvel & Company.Ephum still opened the store in the mornings, but Mr.Hopper was within the ground-glass office before the place was warm, and
through warerooms and shipping rooms, rubbing his hands, to see if any
were late.Many of the old force were missed, and a new and greater
force were come in.These feared Eliphalet as they did the devil, and
worked the harder to please him, because Eliphalet had hired that kind.To them the Colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the
world.He was at the store every day in the winter, and Mr.Hopper
always followed him obsequiously into the ground-glass office, called in
the book-keeper, and showed him the books and the increased earnings.Hood and his slovenly management, and sighed,
in spite of his doubled income.Hopper had added to the Company's
list of customers whole districts in the growing Southwest, and yet the
honest Colonel did not like him.Hopper, by a gradual process,
had taken upon his own shoulders, and consequently off the Colonel's,
responsibility after responsibility.There were some painful scenes,
of course, such as the departure of Mr.Hood, which never would have
occurred had not Eliphalet proved without question the incapacity of
the ancient manager.Hopper only narrowed his lids when the Colonel
pensioned Mr.But the Colonel had a will before which, when
roused, even Mr.So that Eliphalet was always polite
to Ephum, and careful never to say anything in the darkey's presence
against incompetent clerks or favorite customers, who, by the charity of
the Colonel, remained on his books.One spring day, after the sober home-coming of Colonel Carvel from the
Democratic Convention at Charleston, Ephum accosted his master as
he came into the store of a morning.Ephum's face was working with
excitement."What's the matter with you, Ephum?""No, Marsa, I ain't 'zactly."Ephum put down the duster, peered out of the door of the private office,
and closed it softly."Marse Comyn, I ain't got no use fo' dat Misteh Hoppa', Ise kinder
sup'stitious 'bout him, Marsa.""Has he treated you badly, Ephum?"The faithful <DW64> saw another question in his master's face.He well
knew that Colonel Carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning
the conduct of a superior.And I ain't sayin' nuthin' gin his honesty.He straight,
but he powerful sharp, Marse Comyn.An' he jus' mussiless down to a
cent."He realized that which was beyond the grasp of the
<DW64>'s mind.New and thriftier methods of trade from New England were
fast replacing the old open-handedness of the large houses.Competition
had begun, and competition is cruel.Edwards, James, & Company had taken
a Yankee into the firm.They were now Edwards, James, & Doddington, and
Mr.Edwards's coolness towards the Colonel was manifest since the rise
of Eliphalet.But Colonel
Carvel did not know until after years that Mr.Hopper had been offered
the place which Mr.Hopper, increase of salary had not changed him.He still
lived in the same humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane's
boarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had
that first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel's store.He
was superintendent, now, of Mr.Davitt's Sunday School, and a church
officer.At night, when he came home from business, he would read the
widow's evening paper, and the Colonel's morning paper at the office.Of
true Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco.It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman's Bank began to
point out Mr.Hopper's back to casual customers, and he was more than
once seen to enter the president's room, which had carpet on the floor.Eliphalet's suavity with certain delinquent customers from the Southwest
was A wording to Scripture.When they were profane, and invited him
into the street, he reminded them that the city had a police force and a
jail.While still a young man, he had a manner of folding his hands
and smiling which is peculiar to capitalists, and he knew the laws
concerning mortgages in several different states.But Eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which
Providence had placed him, and so to be an example for many of us.He did not buy, or even hire, an evening suit.He was pleased to
superintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before
Virginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the stair-landing.Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in conversation with
the teller of the Boatman's Bank) chanced upon him.Cluyme was so
charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted the rise and fall
of sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr.And
from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of
which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society.If the Cluyme
household was not polite, it was nothing.Eliphalet sat next to Miss
Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he
cherished for future use.Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which
(if the truth were told) needed an apology.All of which is significant,
but sordid and uninteresting.Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before
a rise.There was only one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into
prominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent.If, upon entering
the ground-glass office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel,
Captain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty.The
inquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum.Hopper
had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest
Captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth
Street, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast."Colonel," said he, without an introduction."I don't like this here
business of letting Hopper run your store."Lige," he said gently, "he's nearly doubled my income.It isn't the old
times, when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in
and year out.The Captain took a deep draught of the coffee which Jackson had laid
before him."Colonel Carvel," he said emphatically, "the fellow's a damned rascal,
and will ruin you yet if you don't take advice.""The books show that he's honest, Lige.""Yes," cried Lige, with his fist on the table.But
if that fellow ever gets on top of you, or any one else, he'll grind you
into dust.""He isn't likely to get on top of me, Lige.I know the business, and
keep watch.And now that Jinny's coming home from Monticello, I feel
that I can pay more attention to her--kind of take her mother's place,"
said the Colonel, putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair."Lige,
I want that girl to have every advantage.She ought to go to Europe and
see the world.That trip East last summer did her a heap of good.When
we were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had
written about London, and she was regularly fired.First I must take
her to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall.The Captain walked over to the window, and said nothing.He did not see
the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him."Lige, why don't you give up steamboating and come along to Europe?You're not forty yet, and you have a heap of money laid by."The Captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him."This ain't no time for me to leave," he said."Colonel; I tell you
there's a storm comin'."The Colonel pulled his goatee uneasily.Here, at last, was a man in whom
there was no guile."Lige," he said, "isn't it about time you got married?"Upon which the Captain shook his head again, even with more vigor.After the Christmas holidays he had
driven Virginia across the frozen river, all the way to Monticello, in a
sleigh.It was night when they had reached the school, the light of its
many windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees.He had
helped her out, and had taken her hand as she stood on the step."Be good, Jinny," he had said."Remember what a short time it will be
until June.And your Pa will come over to see you."She had seized him by the buttons of his great coat, and said tearfully:
"O Captain Lige!I shall be so lonely when you are away.He had put his lips to her forehead, driven madly back to Alton, and
spent the night.The first thing he did the next day when he reached
St.Louis was to go straight to the Colonel and tell him bluntly of the
circumstance."Lige, I'd hate to give her up," Mr.Carvel said; "but I'd rather you'd
marry her than any man I can think of."SIGNS OF THE TIMES

In that spring of 1860 the time was come for the South to make her
final stand.And as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground,
Stephen Brice was not the only one who thought of the Question at
Freeport.The hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit.Meanwhile, his hero, the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech,
Abraham Lincoln, had made a little tour eastward the year before, and
had startled Cooper Union with a new logic and a new eloquence.They
were the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled Stephen.Even as he predicted who had given it birth, the Question destroyed the
great Democratic Party.Colonel Carvel travelled to the convention in
historic Charleston soberly and fearing God, as many another Southern
gentleman.In old Saint Michael's they knelt to pray for harmony, for
peace; for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them.All through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain.Judge Douglas,
you flattered yourself that you had evaded the Question.Do you see
the Southern delegates rising in their seats?Alabama leaves the hall,
followed by her sister stakes.The South has not forgotten your Freeport
Heresy.Once she loved you now she will have none of you.Gloomily, indeed, did Colonel Carvel return home.He loved the Union and
the flag for which his grandfather Richard had fought so bravely.So the Judge, laying his hand upon the knee
of his friend, reminded him gravely.The
very calmness of their argument had been portentous.You of the North are bent upon taking away from us the
rights we had when our fathers framed the Constitution.However the
<DW65> got to this country, sir, in your Bristol and Newport traders, as
well as in our Virginia and Maryland ships, he is here, and he was here
when the Constitution was written.He is happier in slavery than are
your factory hands in New England; and he is no more fit to exercise the
solemn rights of citizenship, I say, than the halfbreeds in the South
American states.""Suppose you deprive me of my few slaves, you do not ruin me.Yet you
do me as great a wrong as you do my friend Samuels, of Louisiana, who
depends on the labor of five hundred.Shall I stand by selfishly and see
him ruined, and thousands of others like him?"Profoundly depressed, Colonel Carvel did not attend the adjourned
Convention at Baltimore, which split once more on Mason and Dixon's
line.The Democrats of the young Northwest stood for Douglas and
Johnson, and the solid South, in another hall, nominated Breckenridge
and Lane.This, of course, became the Colonel's ticket.What a Babel of voices was raised that summer!Each with its cure
for existing ills.Between the extremes of the Black Republican
<DW64> Worshippers and the Southern Rights party of Breckenridge, your
conservative had the choice of two candidates,--of Judge Douglas
or Senator Bell.A most respectable but practically extinct body of
gentlemen in ruffled shirts, the Old Line Whigs, had likewise met
in Baltimore.A new name being necessary, they called themselves
Constitutional Unionists Senator Bell was their candidate, and they
proposed to give the Nation soothing-syrup.So said Judge Whipple,
with a grunt of contempt, to Mr.Cluyme, who was then a prominent
Constitutional Unionist.Other and most estimable gentlemen were also
Constitutional Unionists, notably Mr.Far be it from
any one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party,
whose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren.One Sunday evening in May, the Judge was taking tea with Mrs.The occasion was memorable for more than one event--which was that he
addressed Stephen by his first name for the first time."You're an admirer of Abraham Lincoln," he had said.Whipple's ways, smiled quietly at his mother.He had never dared mention to the Judge his suspicions concerning his
journey to Springfield and Freeport."Stephen," said the Judge (here the surprise came in), "Stephen, what do
you think of Mr."We hear of no name but Seward's, sir," said Stephen, When he had
recovered."Do you think that Lincoln would make a good President?""I have thought so, sir, ever since you were good enough to give me the
opportunity of knowing him."It was a bold speech--the Judge drew his great eyebrows together, but he
spoke to Mrs."I'm not as strong as I was once, ma'am," said he."And yet I am going
to that Chicago convention."Brice remonstrated mildly, to the effect that he had done his share
of political work."I shall take a younger man with me, in case anything happens.In fact,
ma'am, I had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him."And so it was that Stephen went to that most dramatic of political
gatherings,--in the historic Wigwam.It was so that his eyes were
opened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the
Republic,--the political machine.Seward had brought his machine
from New York,--a legion prepared to fill the Wigwam with their bodies,
and to drown with their cries all names save that of their master.Through the kindness of Judge
Whipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates
from other states--Pennsylvania and Illinois and Indiana and elsewhere.He perceived that the Judge was no nonentity in this new party.Whipple sat in his own room, and the delegates came and ranged
themselves along the bed.Late one night, when the delegates were gone,
Stephen ventured to speak what was in his mind.Lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man, sir; who would permit
a bargain."Lincoln's at home playing barn-ball," said the Judge, curtly."Then," said Stephen, rather hotly, "I think you are unfair to him.""Stephen, I hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become
a delegate," he answered, with just the suspicion of a smile."Supposing
you are convinced that Abraham Lincoln is the only man who can save the
Union, and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet
Seward's gang with their own methods, what would you do, sir?I want
a practical proposition, sir," said Mr.Whipple, "one that we can use
to-night.As Stephen was silent, the Judge advised him to go to bed.Seward's henchmen, confident and uproarious, were
parading the streets of Chicago with their bands and their bunting, the
vast Wigwam was quietly filling up with bony Westerners whose ally was
none other than the state of Pennsylvania.These gentlemen possessed
wind which they had not wasted in processions.And the Lord delivered
Seward and all that was his into their hands.Seward's hope went out after the first ballot,
and how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept; and how the
voices shook the Wigwam, and the thunder of the guns rolled over the
tossing water of the lake, many now living remember.That day a name was
delivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was
destined to enter history that of the saviour of the Nation.Down in little Springfield, on a vacant lot near the station, a tall
man in his shirt sleeves was playing barn-ball with some boys.The game
finished, he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under
the tree--when a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram.The
tall man read it, and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet
taking long strides, Later in the day he was met by a friend."Abe," said the friend, "I'm almighty glad there somebody in this town's
got notorious at last."In the early morning of their return from Chicago Judge Whipple
and Stephen were standing in the front of a ferry-boat crossing the
Mississippi.The Judge had taken off his hat,
and his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze.Illness had set
a yellow seal on the face, but the younger man remarked it not.For
Stephen, staring at the black blur of the city outline, was filled
with a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his Puritan
forefathers.Now at length was come his chance to be of use in life,--to
dedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to Abraham Lincoln
uncouth prophet of the West.With all his might he would work to save
the city for the man who was the hope of the Union.The great paddles scattered the brow waters with white
foam, and the Judge voiced his thoughts."Stephen," said he, "I guess we'll have to put on shoulders to the wheel
this summer.If Lincoln is not elected I have lived my sixty-five years
for nothing."As he descended the plank, he laid a hand on Stephen's arm, and
tottered.The big Louisiana, Captain Brent's boat, just in from New
Orleans, was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the
levee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it.The clatter of hooves
and the crack of whips reached their ears, and, like many others before
them and since, they stepped into Carvel & Company's.On the inside of
the glass partition of the private office, a voice of great suavity was
heard.It was Eliphalet Hopper's."If you will give me the numbers of the bales, Captain Brent, I'll send
a dray down to your boat and get them.""No, sir, I prefer to do business with my friend, Colonel Carvel."I could sell the goods to Texas buyers who are here in the store right
now.""Until I get instructions from one of the concern," vowed Captain Lige,
"I shall do as I always have done, sir.The Captain's fist was heard to come down on the desk."You don't manage me," he said, "and I reckon you don't manage the
Colonel."Hopper's face was not pleasant to see as he emerged.But at sight of
Judge Whipple on the steps his suavity returned."The Colonel will be in any minute, sir," said he.But the Judge walked past him without reply, and into the office.Captain Brent, seeing him; sprang to his feet."Well, well, Judge," said he, heartily, "you fellows have done it now,
sure.I'll say this for you, you've picked a smart man.""Better vote for him, Lige," said the Judge, setting down."A man's got a lot of choice this year;" said he."Two governments,
thirty-three governments, one government patched up for a year ox two.""Lige, you're not such a fool as
to vote against the Union?""Judge," said the Captain, instantly, "I'm not the only one in this town
who will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong."It's not a question of sympathy, Captain," answered the Judge, dryly."Abraham Lincoln himself was born in Kentucky."If Abraham Lincoln is elected, the South
leaves this Union."The speaker was Colonel Carvel
himself.Whipple cried hotly, "then you will be chastised
and brought back.For at last we have chosen a man who is strong
enough,--who does not fear your fire-eaters,--whose electors depend on
Northern votes alone."Stephen rose apprehensively, So did Captain Lige The Colonel had taken a
step forward, and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes.Judge Whipple, deathly pale, staggered and fell into
Stephen' arms.But it was the Colonel who laid him on the horsehair
sofa.Nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the Colonel
put into those two words.And the brusqueness in his weakened voice
was even more pathetic-- "Tut, tut," said he."A little heat, and no
breakfast."The Colonel already had a bottle of the famous Bourbon day his hand,
and Captain Lige brought a glass of muddy iced water.Carvel made an
injudicious mixture of the two, and held it to the lips of his friend.cried the Judge, and with this effort he slipped back again.Those
who stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on Judge
Whipple's face.But the lips were firmly closed, bidding defiance, as ever, to the
world.The Colonel, stroking his goatee, regarded him curiously."Silas," he said slowly, "if you won't drink it for me, perhaps you will
drink it--for--Abraham--Lincoln."The two who watched that scene have never forgotten it.Outside, in the
great cool store, the rattle of the trucks was heard, and Mr.The straight figure of the Colonel
towered above the sofa while he waited.Once Judge
Whipple's bony hand opened and shut, and once his features worked.Then,
without warning, he sat up."Colonel," said he, "I reckon I wouldn't be much use to Abe if I took
that.But if you'll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--"

Mr.In two strides he had reached the door
and given the order.Then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa.He had forgotten the convention
He told her what had happened at Mr.Carvel's store, and how the Colonel
had tried to persuade Judge Whipple to take the Glencoe house while he
was in Europe, and how the Judge had refused.Tears were in the widow's
eyes when Stephen finished."And he means to stay here in the heat and go through, the campaign?""It will kill him, Stephen," Mrs.And he said that he would die willingly--after
Abraham Lincoln was elected.He had nothing to live for but to fight for
that.He had never understood the world, and had quarrelled with at all
his life."He didn't dare to look at his mother, nor she at him.And when he
reached the office, half an hour later, Mr.Whipple was seated in his
chair, defiant and unapproachable.Stephen sighed as he settled down to
his work.The thought of one who might have accomplished what her father
could not was in his head.Brinsmade's buggy drew up at Mrs.The Brinsmade family had been for some time in the country.And
frequently, when that gentleman was detained in town by business, he
would stop at the little home for tea.The secret of the good man's
visit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward."I fear that it will be a hot summer, ma'am," he had said to Mrs."The heat agrees with me remarkably, Mr.Brinsmade," said the lady,
smiling."I have heard that Colonel Carvel wishes to rent his house at Glencoe,"
Mr.Brinsmade continued, "The figure is not high.""It struck me that a change of air would do you
good, Mrs.Knowing that you shared in our uneasiness
concerning Judge Whipple, I thought--"

He stopped, and looked at her.It was a hard task even for that best
and roost tactful of gentlemen, Mr.He too had misjudged this
calm woman.She saw, as did Stephen,
the kindness behind the offer--Colonel Carvel's kindness and his own.The gentleman's benevolent face brightened:

"And, my dear Madam, do not let the thought of this little house trouble
you.It was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer.If
we could induce the Judge to go to Glencoe with you for the summer; I am
sure it would be a relief for us all."He did not press the matter; but begged Stephen to call on him in a day
or two, at the bank."What do you think, Stephen," asked his mother, when Mr.Brinsmade was
gone, Stephen did not reply at once.The
vision of that proud figure of Miss Virginia was before him, and he
revolted.What was kindness from Colonel Carvel and Mr.Brinsmade was
charity from her.He could not bear the thought of living in a house
haunted by her.And yet why should he let his pride and his feelings
stand in the way of the health--perhaps of the life--of Judge Whipple?It was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the
subject again that evening.But
when he rose in the morning he had made up his mind.After breakfast he
went straight to the Colonel's store, and fortunately found.Carvel
at his desk, winding up his affairs.The next morning, when the train for the East pulled out of
Illinoistown, Miss Jinny Carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving
good-by to a knot of friends.Presently she
went into the sleeping-car to join the Colonel, who wore a gray liners
duster.For a long time she sat gazing at the young, corn waving on
the prairie, fingering the bunch of June roses on her lap.Clarence had
picked them only a few hours ago, in the dew at Bellegarde.She saw her
cousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds, just as she had left
him.She pictured him riding out the Bellefontaine Road that afternoon,
alone.Now that the ocean was to be between them, was it love that she
felt for Clarence at last?Once or twice she
had suspected him of wishing to separate them.Her Aunt Lillian, indeed,
had said as much, and Virginia had silenced her.But when she had asked
the Colonel to take Clarence to Europe, he had refused.And yet she knew
that he had begged Captain Lige to go.She had seen the change in
Clarence and exulted.The very first day she had surprised him on the
porch at Bellegarde with "Hardee's tactics".From a boy Clarence had
suddenly become a man with a Purpose,--and that was the Purpose of the
South."They have dared to nominate that dirty Lincoln," he said.--"Do you
think that we will submit to <DW65> equality rule?"If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until my legs
are shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the
ground."Virginia's heart had leaped within her at the words, and into her eyes
had flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in
vain.Sandra went to the hallway.He had the carriage of a soldier, the animation and endurance
of the thoroughbred when roused.He was of the stuff that made the
resistance of the South the marvel of the world.And well we know,
whatever the sound of it, that his speech was not heroics.Nor was it
love for his cousin that inspired it, save in this: he had apotheosized
Virginia.To him she was the inspired goddess of the South--his country.His admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar.Her
ambition for him he felt was likewise the South's ambition for him.His mother, Virginia's aunt, felt this too, and strove against it with
her feeble might.She never had had power over her son; nor over any
man, save the temporal power of beauty.And to her mortification she
found herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her
daughter.So in Virginia's presence she became more trivial and petty
than ever.It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join
Company A. Few young men of family did not.And now he ran to his room
to don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high
bearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and
the gorgeous, priceless shackle.He
held his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high
resolve there was no mistaking.The high color of her pride was on the
cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his
mistress.And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses
awaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless
determination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her
in the summer house at Glencoe.Strive as she might against the thought,
deny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the
face of the North.Her patriotism and all that was in her of race
rebelled.To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and
Clarence's.Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried
out aloud that it was not inflexible.And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the
prairie, the memory of this was bitter within her."Did you rent our house at Glencoe?"Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent,
even to save Mr.The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise.She was leaning
back on the seat, her eyes half closed."Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it.I always had
a fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than
ever before.It was I who insulted them by naming that rent."'Colonel Carvel,' said he,
'I hear you wish to rent your house.''You rented it once
before, sir,' said he.'May I ask you what price you got
for it?'"I told him," said the Colonel, smiling."But I explained that I could
not expect to command that price now on short notice.He replied that
they would pay it, or not consider the place."Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case
last winter, and since then has had some practice.I believe he declined some sort of an editorial
position, preferring to remain at the law.""And so they are going into the house?""Whipple refused point-blank to go to the
country.He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life
likely to be worth anything.CHAPTER X. RICHTER'S SCAR

This was the summer when Mr.Stephen Brice began to make his appearance
in public.The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise,
although they were not all so.It was at a little town on the outskirts
of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to
listen.In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of
advice which Mr."Speak so that the lowest may
understand, and the rest will have no trouble."At
the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately
wide of the mark.After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his
audience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in
the rear, out of sight of the stand.This may have been Judge Whipple,
although we have no proof of the fact.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech.He
laughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it
was.I have no doubt that many of the master's phrases slipped in, as
young Mr.Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union
speech by heart.He had caught more than the phrasing, however.So
imbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught
it; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages.The event
is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to
ask questions.For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition.Wasn't it
true, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the <DW64> from his master,
give him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man
that owned him?"Slavery may stay where it is," cried the young orator."If it is content there, so are we content.What we say is that it shall
not go one step farther.No, not one inch into a northern territory."Brice was one of the orators at a much larger
meeting in a garden in South St.And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr.Brice was able to
trace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic
wars to its Revolution.Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated
to this great and free country.And when in an inspired moment he
coupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of
the trees above them trembled at their cheers.And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove
with Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena.There was
Herr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly;
and Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and
ponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache
that pointed upward.They clattered their steins on the table and sang
wonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried
off to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with
its towers and crooked streets.And when they sang the Trolksmelodie,
"Bemooster Bursche zieh' ich aus,--Ade!"a big tear rolled down the scar
on Richter's cheek."Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm
        Ich zieh' nicht mehr in euch herum,
        Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,
        Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang."As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness
of that farewell song.It was Richter who brought the full force of it
home to Stephen."Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my
friend?"He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even
to his mother.And here was the difference between the Saxon and the
Anglo-Saxon.Richter smoked his pipe'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his
face."Tiefel and I were at the University together," he said at length."He
remembers the day I left Jena for good and all.Ah, Stephen, that is
the most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland.We
dine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy
little tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us.We swear for
the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for
the Fatherland, if God so wills.And then we march at the head of a slow
procession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first,
then the fox major and the foxes.""The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them," answered Richter,
smiling."And after the foxes," said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, "after the
foxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four.And so we go
slowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many
a schlager-bout with the aristocrats.And the president of our society
makes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all
the honors.And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!"And Herr
Tiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air,
shouting:

"Lebe wohl, Carl!Salamander, salamander, salamander!Ein ist
ein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei!And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they
complimented on his speech.And he soon learned to cry Salamander,
and to rub his mug on the table, German fashion.He was not long in
discovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his
companions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South
St.In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom
Stephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a
United States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in
the singing.But presently he carried Richter away with him."What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!""I think he was the best man with the Schlager
that Jena ever saw.Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask
and fencing hat, all padded.Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent."I have still a welt that he gave me a month since," he said."He has
left his mark on many an aristocrat.""And why did you always fight the aristocrats?"They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed."Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend," he
cried."Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor.Because the
most of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be
by morality and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued.And
so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs.We swore to live by the
standards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke.We swore to strive for
the freedom of Germany with manly courage.And when we were not duelling
with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.""Ja wohl," answered Korner, puffing heavily.The slit in his nose was
plain even in the moonlight."To keep our hands in, as you would say.You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager.But we fought
that we might not become effete."It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long
burning within him.Korner," said he, "how did Richter come by that scar?He
always gets red when I mention it."Ah, I can well believe that," answered Korner."I will recount that
matter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund.Brice," Herr Korner continued, "has never heard of the Count von
Kalbach.We at Jena had, and all Germany.Many of us of
the Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager.Von
Kalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was
worshipped.When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather
to look at them.exclaimed
Herr Korner, "there is something in blood, when all is said.He was as
straight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a
poplar.It is so with the Pomeranians."It was in the year '47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin
before his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von
Kalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion.He
boasted openly that day that none of the despised 'Burschenschaft' dare
stand before him.Before night
all Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena
'Burschenschaft'.To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl
likewise feared for him."Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at
Jena, since killed in the Breite Strasse.And if you will believe me,
my friend.I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak
smoking his pipe.The place was filled, the nobles on one side and
the Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees.Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon.He would
not have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the
neck covering--Nothing!So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap,
and his apron with the device of the Germanians."There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue.And
when it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly
smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon
all.At the sight of the pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf,
and when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast.You,
my friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot
know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade.It was music
that morning: You should have seen the noble's mighty strokes--'Prim und
Second und Terz und Quart'.You would have marked how Richter met him
at every blow.Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke
from the bowl.He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think
how we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was
driven back a step, and then another.You must know that it is a lasting
disgrace to be forced over one's own line.It seemed as if we could not
bear the agony.And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the
half, came a snap like that of a whip's lash, and the bowl of Richter's
pipe lay smouldering on the grass.The noble had cut the stem as clean
as it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still
clenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood.He
pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles.The Count
was smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around
him, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second
mensur,--though the wound was three needles long.Then Kalbach cried
aloud that he would kill him.Something
was in them that made us think as we washed the cut.But when we spoke
to him he said nothing.Nor could we force the pipe stems from his
teeth.exclaimed Herr Korner, but reverently, "if I live to a
hundred I never hope to see such a sight as that 'Mensur'.The Schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard
the ring alone.Before we of the Burschenschaft knew what had happened
the Count von Kalbach was over his line and had flung his Schlager into
a great tree, and was striding from the place with his head hung and the
tears streamin down his face."Amid a silence, Herr Korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly.A wind was rising, bearing with it song and laughter from distant
groups,--Teutonic song and, laughter.The moonlight trembled through the
shifting leaves.And Stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous.It was as if this fierce duel, so full of national significance to a
German, had been fought in another existence, It was incredible to him
that the unassuming lawyer he knew, so wholly Americanized, had been the
hero of it.Strange, indeed, that the striving life of these leaders of
European Revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor.There
came to Stephen a flash of that world-comprehension which marks great
statesmen.Was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force
of patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the
nations, that its high mission might be fulfilled?She and her brothers and Jack
Brinsmade used to banter him when he came a-visiting in Bellefontaine
Road.The time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon
neighbor, when friends of long standing passed each other with averted
looks.It was not even a wild dream that white-trash Lincoln would be
elected.Jack, who made speeches for Breckenridge in the face
of Mr.Brinsmade's Union leanings, laughed at Stephen when he came to
spend the night.He joined forces with Puss in making clever fun of the
booby Dutch, which Stephen was wise enough to take good-naturedly.But
once or twice when he met Clarence Colfax at these houses he was aware
of a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman.This
troubled him more than he cared to admit.For he liked Clarence, who
reminded him of Virginia--at once a pleasure and a pain.It is no harm to admit (for the benefit of the Society for Psychical
Research) that Stephen still dreamed of her.He would go about his work
absently all the morning with the dream still in his head, and the girl
so vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in
England, as Miss Russell said.Puss and Anne were careful to keep him
informed as to her whereabouts.Stephen set this down as a most natural
supposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in
Virginia Carvel.How needless to add that Virginia in her correspondence never mentioned
Stephen, although Puss in her letters took pains to record the fact
every time that he addressed a Black Republican meeting: Miss Carvel
paid no attention to this part of the communications.Her concern for
Judge Whipple Virginia did not hide.How he stood the
rigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike.HOW A PRINCE CAME

Who has not heard of the St.And what memories
of its October days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew
that hallowed place as children.There was the vast wooden amphitheatre
where mad trotting races were run; where stolid cattle walked past the
Chinese pagoda in the middle circle, and shook the blue ribbons on their
horns.But it was underneath the tiers of seats (the whole way around
the ring) that the chief attractions lay hid.These were the church
booths, where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and
ice-cream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity.These ladies
wore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers.And toward the
close of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted.Thayer's,
Unitarian, where Mrs.Davitt's, conducted
by Mr.Eliphalet Hopper on strictly business principles, and the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, where Miss Renault and other young ladies of French
descent presided: and Dr.Posthelwaite's, Presbyterian, which we shall
come to presently.And others, the whole way around the ring.Louisans still delight to recall,--that
of the autumn of 1860--Think for a minute.You will remember that
Virginia Carvel came back from Europe; and made quite a stir in a
town where all who were worth knowing were intimates.Stephen caught a
glimpse of her an the street, received a distant bow, and dreamed of her
that night.Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday suit, was at the ferry
to pay his respects to the Colonel, to offer his services, and to
tell him how the business fared.Louis face that
Virginia saw (Captain Lige being in New Orleans), and if she conversed
with Eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before, there is
nothing strange in that.Hopper rode home with them in the carriage,
and walked to Miss Crane's with his heart thumping against his breast,
and wild thoughts whirling in his head.The next morning, in Virginia's sunny front room tears and laughter
mingled.There was a present for Eugenie and Anne and Emily and Puss
and Maude, and a hear kiss from the Colonel for each.And more tears
and laughter and sighs as Mammy Easter and Rosetta unpacked the English
trunks, and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each Parisian
gown upon the bed.At the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me.Why mention the
dread possibility of the <DW64>-worshiper Lincoln being elected the
very next month?Why listen, to the rumblings in the South?Pompeii had
chariot-races to the mutterings of Vesuvius.Louis was in gala garb
to greet a Prince.That was the year that Miss Virginia Carvel was given charge of the
booth in Dr.Posthelwaite's church,--the booth next one of the great
arches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came.Now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with Miss Jinny?Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?Who slipped into her hand
the contribution for the church, and refused to take the cream candy she
laughingly offered him as an equivalent?None other than Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Duke of Saxony, Duke of
Cornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron Renfrew, and
Lord of the Isles.Out of compliment to the Republic which he visited,
he bore the simple title of Lord Renfrew.Bitter tears of envy, so it was said, were shed in the other booths.Belle Cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed.Eliphalet Hopper,
in Mr.Davitt's booths, stared until his eyes watered.A great throng
peered into the covered way, kept clear for his Royal Highness and
suite, and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them.And when
the Prince was seen to turn to His Grace, the Duke of Newcastle, and the
subscription was forthcoming, a great cheer shook the building, while
Virginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled.Colonel Carvel, who was a Director, laid his hand paternally on the
blue coat of the young Prince.Reversing all precedent, he presented
his Royal Highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies.It was
done with the easy grace of a Southern gentleman.Whereupon Lord Renfrew
bowed and smiled too, and stroked his mustache, which was a habit he
had, and so fell naturally into the ways of Democracy.Miss Puss Russell, who has another name, and whose hair is now white,
will tell you how Virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her
country.It is safe to say that the Prince forgot "Silver Heels" and "Royal Oak,"
although they had been trotted past the Pagoda only that morning for his
delectation.He had forgotten his Honor the Mayor, who had held fast to
the young man's arm as the four coal-black horses had pranced through
the crowds all the way from Barnum's Hotel to the Fair Grounds.His
Royal Highness forgot himself still further, and had at length withdrawn
his hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs
into his yellow waistcoat.And who shall blame him if Miss Virginia's
replies to his sallies enchained him?Not the least impressive of those who stood by, smiling, was the figure
of the tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written on his
face.Oh, that his dear wife might have lived to see this!What was said in that historic interview with a future Sovereign of
England, far from his royal palaces, on Democratic sawdust, with an
American Beauty across a board counter, was immediately recorded by the
Colonel, together with an exact description of his Royal Highness's blue
coat, and light, flowing pantaloons, and yellow waist-coat, and 
kids; even the Prince's habit of stroking his mustache did not escape
the watchful eye.It is said that his Grace of Newcastle smiled twice at
Miss Virginia's retorts, and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, has more
than two to his credit.Miss
Virginia in the very midst of a sentence paused, and then stopped.Her
eyes had strayed from the Royal Countenance, and were fixed upon a
point in the row of heads outside the promenade.Her sentence was
completed--with some confusion.Perhaps it is no wonder that my Lord
Renfrew, whose intuitions are quick, remarked that he had already
remained too long, thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise
should have had.This was a graceful speech, and a kingly.Followed by
his retinue and the prominent citizens, he moved on.And it was remarked
by keen observers that his Honor the Mayor had taken hold once more of
the Prince's elbow, who divided his talk with Colonel Carver.What a true American of the old type you were.You,
nor the Mayor, nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not
blinded by the light of a royal Presence.You saw in him only an amiable
and lovable young man, who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable
of sovereigns, Victoria.You, Colonel Carvel, were not one to cringe to
royalty.Out of respect for the just and lenient Sovereign, his mother,
you did honor to the Prince.But you did not remind him, as you might
have, that your ancestors fought for the King at Marston Moor, and that
your grandfather was once an intimate of Charles James Fox.Cluyme, and of a few others whose wealth alone
enabled them to be Directors of the Fair?Miss Isabel Cluyme
