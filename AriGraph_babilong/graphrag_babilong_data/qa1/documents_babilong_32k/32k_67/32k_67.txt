Every
case has gone against us, and no appeal, madam.You are left hopelessly
destitute, and penniless.Daymon should have employed me ten years
ago--but now, it is too late.Everything is gone, madam,” and the
Governor paused.“My mother was once a poor, penniless girl, and I can
bear it too,” said Roxie, calmly.“But you see,” said the Governor,
softening his voice; “you are a handsome young lady; your fortune is yet
to be made.For fifty dollars, madam, I can fix you up a _shadow_, that
will marry you off.You see the law has some _loop holes_ and--and in
your case, madam, it is no harm to take one; no harm, no harm, madam,”
 and the Governor paused again.Roxie looked at the man sternly, and
said: “I have no further use for a lawyer, Sir.”

“Any business hereafter, madam, that you may wish transacted, send your
card to No.77, Strait street,” and the Governor made a side move toward
the door, touched the rim of his hat and disappeared.It was in the golden month of October, and calm, smoky days of
Indian summer, that a party of young people living in Chicago, made
arrangements for a pleasure trip to New Orleans.There were four or five
young ladies in the party, and Roxie Daymon was one.She was handsome
and interesting--if her fortune _was gone_.The party consisted of the
moneyed aristocracy of the city, with whom Roxie had been raised and
educated.Every one of the party was willing to contribute and pay
Roxie's expenses, for the sake of her company.A magnificent steamer, of
the day, plying between St.Louis and New Orleans, was selected for
the carrier, three hundred feet in length, and sixty feet wide.The
passenger cabin was on the upper deck, nearly two hundred feet in
length; a guard eight feet wide, for a footway, and promenade on the
outside of the hall, extended on both sides, the fall length of the
cabin; a plank partition divided the long hall--the aft room was the
ladies', the front the gentlemen's cabin.The iron horse, or some of
his successors, will banish these magnificent floating palaces, and I
describe, for the benefit of coming generations.Nothing of interest occured to our party, until the boat landed at the
Simon plantations.Young Simon and cousin Cæsar boarded the boat, for
passage to New Orleans, for they were on their way to the West Indies,
to spend the winter.Young Simon was in the last stage of consumption
and his physician had recommended the trip as the last remedy.Young
Simon was walking on the outside guard, opposite the ladies' cabin, when
a female voice with a shrill and piercing tone rang upon his ear--“_Take
Roxie Daymon away_.” The girls were romping.--“Take Roxie Daymon away,”
 were the mysterious dying words of young Simon's father.Simon turned,
and mentally bewildered, entered the gentlemen's cabin.A <DW52> boy,
some twelve years of age, in the service of the boat, was passing--Simon
held a silver dollar in his hand as he said, “I will give you this, if
you will ascertain and point out to me the lady in the cabin, that they
call _Roxie Daymon_.” The imp of Africa seized the coin, and passing on
said in a voice too low for Simon's ear, “good bargain, boss.” The Roman
Eagle was running down stream through the dark and muddy waters of the
Mississippi, at the rate of twenty miles an hour.In the dusk of the evening, Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were sitting
side by side--alone, on the aft-guard of the boat.The ever open ear
of the Angel of observation has furnished us with the following
conversation..

“Your mother's maiden name, is what I am anxious to learn,” said Simon
gravely.“Roxie Fairfield, an orphan girl, raised in Kentucky,” said Roxie sadly.“Was she an only child, or did she have sisters?” said Simon
inquiringly.“My mother died long years ago--when I was too young to remember,
my father had no relations--that I ever heard of--Old aunt Patsey
Perkins--a great friend of mother's in her life-time, told me after
mother was dead, and I had grown large enough to think about kinsfolk,
that mother had two sisters somewhere, named Rose and Suza, _poor
trash_, as she called them; and that is all I know of my relations: and
to be frank with you, I am nothing but poor trash too, I have no family
history to boast of,” said Roxie honestly.“You will please excuse me Miss, for wishing to know something of your
family history--there is a mystery connected with it, that may prove
to your advantage”--Simon was _convinced_.--He pronounced the
word twenty--when the Angel of caution placed his finger on his
lip--_hush!_--and young Simon turned the conversation, and as soon as
he could politely do so, left the presence of the young lady, and sought
cousin Cæsar, who by the way, was well acquainted with the most of the
circumstances we have recorded, but had wisely kept them to himself.Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story.Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his
estate.Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others
lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant
of Brindle Bill.Mary went back to the hallway.The pleasure party with Simon and cousin Cæsar, stopped
at the same hotel in the Crescent City.At the end of three weeks the
pleasure party returned to Chicago.Young Simon and cousin Cæsar left
for the West Indies.--Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were engaged to be
married the following spring at Chicago.Simon saw many beautiful women
in his travels--but the image of Roxie Daymon was ever before him.The
good Angel of observation has failed to inform us, of Roxie Daymon's
feelings and object in the match.A young and beautiful woman; full of
life and vigor consenting to wed a dying man, _hushed_ the voice of the
good Angel, and he has said nothing.Spring with its softening breezes returned--the ever to be remembered
spring of 1861.The shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival of young Simon
and cousin Cæsar in Chicago, on the 7th day of April, 1861.Simon had lived upon excitement, and reaching the destination of his
hopes--the great source of his life failed--cousin Cæsar carried
him into the hotel--he never stood alone again--the marriage was put
off--until Simon should be better.On the second day, cousin Cæsar was
preparing to leave the room, on business in a distant part of the city.Roxie had been several times alone with Simon, and was then present.Roxie handed a sealed note to cousin Cæsar, politely asking him to
deliver it.Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law
appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all
of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon.“How much,” said
Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave.“Only ten dollars, madam,”
 said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket
and departed.Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the
dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul
of young Simon was with his fathers.The day was consumed in making
preparations for the last, honor due the dead.Cousin Cæsar arranged
with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the
side of the father, on the home plantation.The next morning as cousin
Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice
attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter,
who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his
whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a
young lady of this city.”

Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished.He was a stranger in the
city; he rubbed his hand across his forehead to collect his thoughts,
and remembered No.“Yes I observed it--it is a
law office,” he said mentally, “there is something in that number
seventy-seven, I have never understood it before, since my dream on the
steam carriage _seventy-seven_,” and cousin Cæsar directed his steps
toward Strait street.“Important business, I suppose sir,” said Governor Mo-rock, as he read
cousin Cæsar's anxious countenance.“Yes, somewhat so,” said cousin Cæsar, pointing to the notice in the
paper, he continued: “I am a relative of Simon and have served him
faithfully for two years, and they say he has willed his estate to a
stranger.”

“Is it p-o-s-s-i-b-l-e-,” said the Governor, affecting astonishment.“What would you advise me to do?” said cousin Cæsar imploringly.“Break the will--break the will, sir,” said the Governor emphatically.that will take money,” said cousin Cæsar sadly.“Yes, yes, but it will bring money,” said the Governor, rubbing his
hands together.“I s-u-p p-o-s-e we would be required to prove incapacity on the part of
Simon,” said cousin Cæsar slowly.“Money will prove anything,” said the Governor decidedly.The Governor struck the right key, for cousin Cæsar was well schooled in
treacherous humanity, and noted for seeing the bottom of things; but he
did not see the bottom of the Governor's dark designs.“How much for this case?” said cousin Cæsar.I am liberal--I am liberal,” said the Governor rubbing his hands
and continuing, “can't tell exactly, owing to the trouble and cost of
the things, as we go along.A million is the stake--well, let me see,
this is no child's play.A man that has studied for long years--you
can't expect him to be cheap--but as I am in the habit of working for
nothing--if you will pay me one thousand dollars in advance, I will
undertake the case, and then a few more thousands will round it
up--can't say exactly, any more sir, than I am always liberal.”

Cousin Cæsar had some pocket-money, furnished by young Simon, to pay
expenses etc., amounting to a little more than one thousand dollars.His
mind was bewildered with the number seventy-seven, and he paid over to
the Governor one thousand dollars.After Governor Morock had the money
safe in his pocket, he commenced a detail of the cost of the suit--among
other items, was a large amount for witnesses.The Governor had the case--it was a big case--and the Governor has
determined to make it pay him.Cousin Caeser reflected, and saw that he must have help, and as he left
the office of Governor Morock, said mentally: “One of them d--n figure
sevens I saw in my dream, would fall off the pin, and I fear, I have
struck the wrong lead.”

In the soft twilight of the evening, when the conductor cried, “all
aboard,” cousin Cæsar was seated in the train, on his way to Kentucky,
to solicit aid from Cliff Carlo, the oldest son and representative man,
of the family descended from Don Carlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, and
Suza Fairfield, the belle of Port William.SCENE SEVENTH--WAR BETWEEN THE STATES.|The late civil war between the States of the American Union was the
inevitable result of two civilizations under one government, which no
power on earth could have prevented We place the federal and confederate
soldier in the same scale _per se_, and one will not weigh the other
down an atom.So even will they poise that you may mark the small allowance of the
weight of a hair.But place upon the beam the pea of their actions while
upon the stage, _on either side_, an the poise may be up or down.More than this, your orator has nothing to say of the war, except its
effect upon the characters we describe.The bright blossoms of a May morning were opening to meet the sunlight,
while the surrounding foliage was waving in the soft breeze ol spring;
on the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio, where the momentous events
of the future were concealed from the eyes of the preceding generation
by the dar veil of the coming revolutions of the globe.We see Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo in close counsel, upon the subject
of meeting the expenses of the contest at law over the Simon estate, in
the State of Arkansas.Cliff Carlo was rather non-committal.Roxie Daymon was a near relative,
and the unsolved problem in the case of compromise and law did not admit
of haste on the part of the Carlo family.Compromise was not the forte
of Cousin Cæsar, To use his own words, “I have made the cast, and will
stand the hazard of the die.”

But the enterprise, with surrounding circumstances, would have baffled a
bolder man than Cæsar Simon.The first gun of the war had been fired at
Fort Sumter, in South Carolina, on the 12th day of April, 1861.The President of the United States had called for seventy-five thousand
war-like men to rendezvous at Washington City, and form a _Praetorian_
guard, to strengthen the arm of the government._To arms, to arms!_ was
the cry both North and South.The last lingering hope of peace between
the States had faded from the minds of all men, and the bloody crest of
war was painted on the horizon of the future.The border slave States,
in the hope of peace, had remained inactive all winter.They now
withdrew from the Union and joined their fortunes with the South,
except Kentucky--the _dark and bloody ground_ historic in the annals
of war--showed the _white feather_, and announced to the world that her
soil was the holy ground of peace.This proclamation was _too thin_
for Cæsar Simon.Some of the Carlo family had long since immigrated
to Missouri.To consult with them on the war affair, and meet with an
element more disposed to defend his prospect of property, Cousin
Cæsar left Kentucky for Missouri.On the fourth day of July, 1861,
in obedience to the call of the President, the Congress of the United
States met at Washington City.This Congress called to the contest five
hundred thousand men; “_cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war_,” and
Missouri was invaded by federal troops, who were subsequently put under
the command of Gen.About the middle of July we see Cousin Cæsar
marching in the army of Gen.Sterling Price--an army composed of all
classes of humanity, who rushed to the conflict without promise of
pay or assistance from the government of the Confederate States of
America--an army without arms or equipment, except such as it gathered
from the citizens, double-barreled shot-guns--an army of volunteers
without the promise of pay or hope of reward; composed of men from
eighteen to seventy years of age, with a uniform of costume varying from
the walnut  roundabout to the pigeon-tailed broadcloth coat.The
mechanic and the farmer, the professional and the non-professional,'
the merchant and the jobber, the speculator and the butcher, the country
schoolmaster and the printer's devil, the laboring man and the dead
beat, all rushed into Price's army, seemingly under the influence of the
watchword of the old Jews, “_To your tents, O Israeli_” and it is a
fact worthy of record that this unarmed and untrained army never lost a
battle on Missouri soil in the first year of the war.Jackson
had fled from Jefferson City on the approach of the federal army, and
assembled the Legislature at Neosho, in the southwest corner of the
State, who were unable to assist Price's army.The troops went into the
field, thrashed the wheat and milled it for themselves; were often upon
half rations, and frequently lived upon roasting ears.Except the Indian
or border war in Kentucky, fought by a preceding generation, the first
year of the war in Missouri is unparalleled in the history of war
on this continent.Price managed to subsist an army without
governmental resources.His men were never demoralized for the want of
food, pay or clothing, and were always cheerful, and frequently danced
'round their camp-fires, bare-footed and ragged, with a spirit of
merriment that would put the blush upon the cheek of a circus.Price wore nothing upon his shoulders but a brown linen duster, and, his
white hair streaming in the breeze on the field of battle, was a picture
resembling the _war-god_ of the Romans in ancient fable.* The so called battle of Boonville was a rash venture of
     citizens, not under the command of Gen.This army of ragged heroes marched over eight hundred miles on Missouri
soil, and seldom passed a week without an engagement of some kind--it
was confined to no particular line of operations, but fought the enemy
wherever they found him.It had started on the campaign without a
dollar, without a wagon, without a cartridge, and without a bayonet-gun;
and when it was called east of the Mississippi river, it possessed about
eight thousand bayonet-guns, fifty pieces of cannon, and four hundred
tents, taken almost exclusively from the Federals, on the hard-fought
fields of battle.When this army crossed the Mississippi river the star of its glory had
set never to rise again.The invigorating name of _state rights_ was
_merged_ in the Southern Confederacy.With this prelude to surrounding circumstances, we will now follow the
fortunes of Cousin Cæsar.Enured to hardships in early life, possessing
a penetrating mind and a selfish disposition, Cousin Cæsar was ever
ready to float on the stream of prosperity, with triumphant banners, or
go down as _drift wood_.And whatever he may have lacked in manhood, he was as brave as a lion on
the battle-field; and the campaign of Gen.Price in Missouri suited no
private soldier better than Cæsar Simon.Like all soldiers in an active
army, he thought only of battle and amusement.Consequently, the will,
Gov.Morock and the Simon estate occupied but little of Cousin Cæsar's
reflections.One idea had taken possession of him, and that was southern
victory.He enjoyed the triumphs of his fellow soldiers, and ate his
roasting ears with the same invigorating spirit.A sober second thought
and cool reflections only come with the struggle for his own life, and
with it a self-reproach that always, sooner or later, overtakes the
faithless.The battle of Oak Hill, usually called the battle of Springfield, was
one of the hardest battles fought west of the Mississippi river.Lyon, amounted to nearly ten thousand men.The confederate t oops, under Generals McCulloch, Price, and Pearce,
were about eleven thousand men.On the ninth of August the Confederates camped at Wilson's Creek,
intending to advance upon the Federals at Springfield.The next morning
General Lyon attacked them before sunrise.The battle was fought with
rash bravery on both sides.General Lyon, after having been twice
wounded, was shot dead while leading a rash charge.Half the loss on the
Confederate side was from Price's army--a sad memorial of the part they
took in the contest.Soon after the fall of General Lyon the Federals
retreated to Springfield, and left the Confederates master of the field.About the closing scene of the last struggle, Cousin Cæsar received a
musket ball in the right leg, and fell among the wounded and dying.The wound was not necessarily fatal; no bone was broken, but it was very
painful and bleeding profusely.When Cousin Cæsar, after lying a
long time where he fell, realized the situation, he saw that without
assistance he must bleed to death; and impatient to wait for some one to
pick him up, he sought quarters by his own exertions.He had managed to
crawl a quarter of a mile, and gave out at a point where no one would
think of looking for the wounded.Weak from the loss of blood, he could
crawl no farther.The light of day was only discernable in the dim
distance of the West; the Angel of silence had spread her wing over
the bloody battle field.In vain Cousin Cæsar pressed his hand upon the
wound; the crimson life would ooze out between his fingers, and Cousin
Cæsar lay down to die.It was now dark; no light met his eye, and no
sound came to his ear, save the song of two grasshoppers in a cluster of
bushes--one sang “Katie-did!” and the other sang “Katie-didn't!” Cousin
Cæsar said, mentally, “It will soon be decided with me whether Katie did
or whether she didn't!” In the last moments of hope Cousin Cæsar heard
and recognized the sound of a human voice, and gathering all the
strength of his lungs, pronounced the word--“S-t-e-v-e!” In a short
time he saw two men approaching him.It was Steve Brindle and a Cherokee
Indian.As soon as they saw the situation, the Indian darted like a wild
deer to where there had been a camp fire, and returned with his cap full
of ashes which he applied to Cousin Cæsar's wound.Steve Brindle bound
it up and stopped the blood.The two men then carried the wounded man to
camp--to recover and reflect upon the past.Steve Brindle was a private,
in the army of General Pearce, from Arkansas, and the Cherokee Indian
was a camp follower belonging to the army of General McCulloch.They
were looking over the battle field in search of their missing friends,
when they accidentally discovered and saved Cousin Cæsar.Early in the month of September, Generals McCulloch and Price having
disagreed on the plan of campaign, General Price announced to his
officers his intention of moving north, and required a report of
effective men in his army.A lieutenant, after canvassing the company to
which Cousin Cæsar belonged, went to him as the last man.Cousin Cæsar
reported ready for duty.“All right, you are the last man--No.77,” said
the lieutenant, hastily, leaving Cousin Cæsar to his reflections.“There
is that number again; what can it mean?Marching north, perhaps to
meet a large force, is our company to be reduced to seven?One of them
d------d figure sevens would fall off and one would be left on the pin.How should it be counted--s-e-v-e-n or half?Set up two guns and take
one away, half would be left; enlist two men, and if one is killed, half
would be left--yet, with these d------d figures, when you take one you
only have one eleventh part left.Cut by the turn of fortune; cut with
short rations; cut with a musket ball; cut by self-reproach--_ah, that's
the deepest cut of all!_” said Cousin Cæsar, mentally, as he retired to
the tent.Steve Brindle had saved Cousin Cæsar's life, had been an old comrade
in many a hard game, had divided his last cent with him in many hard
places; had given him his family history and opened the door for him to
step into the palace of wealth.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Yet, when Cousin Cæsar was surrounded
with wealth and power, when honest employment would, in all human
possibility, have redeemed his old comrade, Cousin Cæsar, willing to
conceal his antecedents, did not know S-t-e-v-e Brindle.General Price reached the Missouri river, at Lexington, on the 12th of
September, and on the 20th captured a Federal force intrenched there,
under the command of Colonel Mulligan, from whom he obtained five
cannon, two mortars and over three thousand bayonet guns.In fear
of large Federal forces north of the Missouri river, General Price
retreated south.Cousin Cæsar was again animated with the spirit of
war and had dismissed the superstitious fear of 77 from his mind.He
continued his amusements round the camp fires in Price's army, as he
said, mentally, “Governor Morock will keep things straight, at his
office on Strait street, in Chicago.”

Roxie Daymon had pleasantly passed the summer and fall on the reputation
of being _rich_, and was always the toast in the fashionable parties
of the upper-ten in Chicago.During the first year of the war it was
emphatically announced by the government at Washington, that it would
never interfere with the slaves of loyal men.Roxie Daymon was loyal
and lived in a loyal city.It was war times, and Roxie had received no
dividends from the Simon estate.In the month of January, 1862, the cold north wind from the lakes swept
the dust from the streets in Chicago, and seemed to warn the secret,
silent thoughts of humanity of the great necessity of m-o-n-e-y.The good Angel of observation saw Roxie Daymon, with a richly-trimmed
fur cloak upon her shoulders and hands muffed, walking swiftly on Strait
street, in Chicago, watching the numbers--at No.The good Angel opened his ear and has furnished us with the following
conversation;

“I have heard incidentally that Cæsar Simon is preparing to break the
will of my _esteemed_ friend, Young Simon, of Arkansas,” said Roxie,
sadly.“Is it p-o-s s-i-b-l-e?” said Governor Morock, affecting astonishment,
and then continued, “More work for the lawyers, you know I am always
liberal, madam.”

“But do you think it possible?” said Roxie, inquiringly.“You have money
enough to fight with, madam, money enough to fight,” said the Governor,
decidedly.“I suppose we will have to prove that Simon was in full
possession of his mental faculties at the time,” said Roxie, with legal
_acumen_.“Certainly, certainly madam, money will prove anything; will
prove anything, madam,” said the Governor, rubbing his hands.“I believe
you were the only person present at the time,” said Roxie, honestly.“I am always liberal, madam, a few thousands will arrange the testimony,
madam.Leave that to me, if you please,” and in a softer tone of voice
the Governor continued, “you ought to pick up the _crumbs_, madam, pick
up the crumbs.”

“I would like to do so for I have never spent a cent in the prospect of
the estate, though my credit is good for thousands in this city.. I want
to see how a dead man's shoes will fit before I wear them,” said Roxie,
sadly.“Good philosophy, madam, good philosophy,” said the Governor, and
continued to explain.“There is cotton on the bank of the river at the
Simon plantations.Some arrangement ought to be made, and I think
I could do it through some officer of the federal army,” said the
Governor, rubbing his hand across his forehead, and continued, “that's
what I mean by picking up the crumbs, madam.”

“_How much?_” said Roxie, preparing to leave the office.“I m always liberal, madam, always liberal.Let me see; it is attended
with some difficulty; can't leave the city; too much business pressing
(rubbing his hands); well--well--I will pick up the crumbs for half.Think I can secure two or three hundred bales of cotton, madam,” said
the Governor, confidentially.“How much is a bale of cotton worth?” said Roxie, affecting ignorance.“Only four hundred dollars, madam; nothing but a crumb--nothing but a
crumb, madam,” said the Governor, in a tone of flattery.“Do the best you can,” said Roxie, in a confidential tone, as she left
the office.Governor Morock was enjoying the reputation of the fashionable lawyer
among the upper-ten in Chicago.Roxie Daymon's good sense condemned him,
but she did not feel at liberty to break the line of association.Cliff Carlo did nothing but write a letter of inquiry to Governor
Morock, who informed him that the Simon estate was worth more than a
million and a quarter, and that m-o-n-e-y would _break the will_.The second year of the war burst the bubble of peace in Kentucky.The clang of arms on the soil where the
heroes of a preceding generation slept, called the martial spirits in
the shades of Kentucky to rise and shake off the delusion that peace and
plenty breed cowards.Cliff Carlo, and many others of the brave sons of
Kentucky, united with the southern armies, and fully redeemed their war
like character, as worthy descendents of the heroes of the _dark and
bloody ground_.Cliff Carlo passed through the struggles of the war without a sick day
or the pain of a wound.We must, therefore, follow the fate of the less
fortunate Cæsar Simon.During the winter of the first year of the war, Price's army camped on
the southern border of Missouri.On the third day of March, 1862, Maj.Earl Van Dorn, of the
Confederate government, assumed the command of the troops under Price
and McCulloch, and on the seventh day of March attacked the Federal
forces under Curtis and Sturgis, twenty-five thousand strong, at
Elkhorn, Van Dorn commanding about twenty thousand men.Price's army constituted the left and center, with McCulloch on the
right.About two o'clock McCulloch
fell, and his forces failed to press the contest.The Federals retreated in good order, leaving the Confederates master of
the situation.For some unaccountable decision on the part of Gen.Van Dorn, a retreat
of the southern army was ordered, and instead of pursuing the Federals,
the wheels of the Southern army were seen rolling south.Van Dorn had ordered the sick and disabled many miles in advance of
the army.Cousin Cæsar had passed through the conflict safe and sound;
it was a camp rumor that Steve Brindle was mortally wounded and sent
forward with the sick.The mantle of night hung over Price's army, and
the camp fires glimmered in the soft breeze of the evening.Silently and
alone Cousin Cæsar stole away from the scene on a mission of love and
duty.Poor Steve Brindle had ever been faithful to him, and Cousin Cæsar
had suffered self-reproach for his unaccountable neglect of a faithful
friend.An opportunity now presented itself for Cousin Cæsar to relieve
his conscience and possibly smooth the dying pillow of his faithful
friend, Steve Brindle.Bravely and fearlessly on he sped and arrived at the camp of the sick.Worn down with the march, Cousin Cæsar never rested until he had looked
upon the face of the last sick man.Slowly and sadly Cousin Cæsar returned to the army, making inquiry of
every one he met for Steve Brindle.After a long and fruitless inquiry,
an Arkansas soldier handed Cousin Cæsar a card, saying, “I was
requested by a soldier in our command to hand this card to the man whose
name it bears, in Price's army.” Cousin Cæsar took the card and read,
“Cæsar Simon--No.77 deserted.” Cousin Cæsar threw the card down as
though it was nothings as he said mentally, “What can it mean.There are
those d----d figures again.Steve understood my ideas of the mysterious
No.Steve has deserted and takes this plan
to inform me.that is it!_ Steve has couched the information in
language that no one can understand but myself.Two of us were on the
carriage and two figure sevens; one would fall off the pin.He knew I would understand his card when no one else could.But did Steve only wish me to understand that he had left, or did he
wish me to follow?” was a problem Cousin Cæsar was unable to decide.It
was known to Cousin Cæsar that the Cherokee Indian who, in company with
Steve, saved his life at Springfield, had, in company with some of his
race, been brought upon the stage of war by Albert Pike.And
Cousin Cæsar was left alone, with no bosom friend save the friendship
of one southern soldier for another.And the idea of _desertion_ entered
the brain of Cæsar Simon for the first time.Cæsar Simon was a born soldier, animated by the clang of arms and roar
of battle, and although educated in the school of treacherous humanity,
he was one of the few who resolved to die in the last ditch, and he
concluded his reflections with the sarcastic remark, “Steve Brindle is a
coward.”

Before Gen.Sandra moved to the bathroom.Van Dorn faced the enemy again, he was called east of the
Mississippi river.Price's army embarked at Des Arc, on White river, and
when the last man was on board the boats, there were none more cheerful
than Cousin Cæsar.He was going to fight on the soil of his native
State, for it was generally understood the march by water was to
Memphis, Tennessee.It is said that a portion of Price's army showed the _white feather_
at Iuka.Cousin Cæsar was not in that division of the army.After that
event he was a camp lecturer, and to him the heroism of the army owes
a tribute in memory for the brave hand to hand fight in the streets
of Corinth, where, from house to house and within a stone's throw of
Rosecrans'' headquarters, Price's men made the Federals fly.But the
Federals were reinforced from their outposts, and Gen.Van Dorn was in
command, and the record says he made a rash attack and a hasty retreat.T. C. Hindman was the southern commander of what was called
the district of Arkansas west of the Mississippi river.He was a petty
despot as well as an unsuccessful commander of an army.The country
suffered unparalleled abuses; crops were ravaged, cotton burned, and
the magnificent palaces of the southern planter licked up by flames.The
torch was applied frequently by an unknown hand.The Southern commander
burned cotton to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy.Straggling soldiers belonging to distant commands traversed the country,
robbing the people and burning.How much of this useless destruction
is chargable to Confederate or Federal commanders, it is impossible to
determine.Much of the waste inflicted upon the country was by the hand
of lawless guerrillas.Four hundred bales of cotton were burned on the
Simon plantation, and the residence on the home plantation, that cost
S. S. Simon over sixty-five thousand dollars, was nothing but a heap of
ashes.Governor Morock's agents never got any _crumbs_, although the Governor
had used nearly all of the thousand dollars obtained from Cousin
Cæsar to pick up the _crumbs_ on the Simon plantations, he never got a
_crumb_.General Hindman was relieved of his command west of the Mississippi, by
President Davis.Generals Kirby, Smith, Holmes and Price subsequently
commanded the Southern troops west of the great river.The federals had
fortified Helena, a point three hundred miles above Vicks burg on the
west bank of the river.They had three forts with a gun-boat lying in
the river, and were about four thousand strong.They were attacked by
General Holmes, on the 4th day of July, 1863.General Holmes had under
his command General Price's division of infantry, about fourteen hundred
men; Fagans brigade of Arkansas, infantry, numbering fifteen hundred
men, and Marmaduke's division of Arkansas, and Missouri cavalry, about
two thousand, making a total of four thousand and nine hundred men.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Marmaduke was ordered to attack the northern fort; Fagan was to attack
the southern fort, and General Price the center fort.The onset to be
simultaneously and at daylight.The
gun-boat in the river shelled the captured fort.Price's men sheltered
themselves as best they could, awaiting further orders.The scene
was alarming above description to Price's men.The failure of their comrades in arms would
compel them to retreat under a deadly fire from the enemy.While thus
waiting, the turn of battle crouched beneath an old stump.Cousin Cæsar
saw in the distance and recognized Steve Brindle, he was a soldier in
the federal army.must I live to learn thee still Steve Brindle
fights for m-o-n-e-y?” said Cæsar Simon, mentally.The good Angel
of observation whispered in his car: “Cæsar Simon fights for land
_stripped of its ornaments._” Cousin Cæsar scanned the situation and
continued to say, mentally: “Life is a sentence of punishment passed by
the court of existence on every _private soldier_.”

The battle field is the place of execution, and rash commanders are
often the executioners.After repeated efforts General Holmes failed to
carry the other positions.The retreat of Price's men was ordered;
it was accomplished with heavy loss.Cæsar Simon fell, and with him
perished the last link in the chain of the Simon family in the male
line.We must now let the curtain fall upon the sad events of the war until
the globe makes nearly two more revolutions 'round the sun in its
orbit, and then we see the Southern soldiers weary and war-worn--sadly
deficient in numbers--lay down their arms--the war is ended.The Angel
of peace has spread her golden wing from Maine to Florida, and from
Virginia to California.The proclamation of freedom, by President
Lincoln, knocked the dollars and cents out of the flesh and blood of
every slave on the Simon plantations.The last foot of the Simon land has been sold at sheriff's sale to pay
judgments, just and unjust.=

Cliff Carlo is a prosperous farmer in Kentucky and subscriber for


THE ROUGH DIAMOND.To allow, what would otherwise be, a useful worker to eat the bread
of idleness because it was regarded as too well bred or valuable to
wear a collar is not a policy to pursue or to recommend, especially to
farmers, seeing that the arable land tenant can put a colt into the
team, between two steady horses at almost any time of the year, while
the occupiers of grass farms may easily start their young Shires as
workers by hitching them to a log of wood or some chain harrows, and
afterwards work them in a roll.There is no doubt, whatever, that many stallions would leave a much
higher percentage of foals if they were “broken in” during their
two-year-old days, so that they would take naturally to work when they
grew older and could therefore be relied upon to work and thus keep
down superfluous fat.This would be far better than allowing them to
spend something like nine months of the year in a box or small paddock
with nothing to do but eat.In past times more working stallions could be found, and they
were almost invariably good stock getters, but since showing has
become popular it is almost a general rule to keep well-bred, or
prize-winning, colts quite clear of the collar lest they should work
themselves down in condition and so fail to please possible buyers on
the look-out for show candidates.A little more than twenty years ago there was an outcry against show
condition in Shires, and this is what a very eminent breeder of those
days said on the subject of fat--

    “It is a matter of no consequence to any one, save their
    owners, when second or third-class horses are laden with
    blubber; but it is a national calamity when the best
    animals--those that ought to be the proud sires and dams of
    an ever-improving race--are stuffed with treacle and drugged
    with poisons in order to compete successfully with their
    inferiors.Hence come fever in the feet, diseased livers, fatty
    degeneration of the heart, and a host of ailments that often
    shorten the lives of their victims and always injure their
    constitutions.”

This bears out my contention that Shires of both sexes would pay for a
course of training in actual collar work, no matter how blue-blooded as
regards ancestry or how promising for the show ring.The fact that a
colt by a London champion had been seen in the plough team, or between
a pair of shafts, would not detract from his value in the eyes of a
judge, or prevent him from becoming a weighty and muscular horse; in
fact, it would tend to the development of the arms and thighs which
one expects to find in a Shire stallion, and if from any cause a stud
or show career is closed, a useful one at honest work may still be
carried on.Wealthy stud owners can afford to pay grooms to exercise their horses,
but farmers find--and are more than ever likely to find--that it is
necessary to make the best possible use of their men; therefore,
if their colts and fillies are put to work and rendered perfectly
tractable, they will grow up as stallions which may be worked instead
of being aimlessly exercised, while the mares can spend at least half
of their lives in helping to carry on the ordinary work of the farm.It is certainly worth while to take pains to train a young Shire,
which is worth rearing at all, to lead from its foalhood days so that
it is always approachable if required for show or sale, and these
early lessons prepare it for the time when it is old enough to put its
shoulders into the collar, this being done with far less risk than it
is in the case of youngsters which have been turned away and neglected
till they are three years old.The breaking in of this class of colt
takes time and strength, while the task of getting a halter on is no
light one, and the whole business of lungeing, handling, and harnessing
requires more brute force and courage than the docile animal trained in
infancy calls for.The secret of training any horse is to keep it from knowing its own
strength; therefore, if it is taught to lead before it is strong enough
to break away, and to be tied up before it can break the headcollar
by hanging back it is obvious that less force is required.The horse
which finds he can break his halter by hanging back is likely to become
a troublesome animal to stand tied up, while the one which throws its
rider two or three times does not forget that it is possible to get a
man off its back; therefore it is better and safer if they never gain
such knowledge of their own powers.The Shire breeding farmer ought to be able to go into his field and put
a halter on any animal required, from a foal to an old horse, and he
can do this if they have been treated with kindness and handled from
their early days.This is a matter to which many farmers should give more attention than
they do, seeing that an ill-trained show animal may lose a prize for no
other reason than that its show manners are faulty, whereas those of
the nearest rival are perfect.The writer was taught this while showing at a County Show very early in
his career.The animal he was leading was--like himself--rather badly
educated, and this was noticed by one of the oldest and best judges of
that day, and this is what he whispered in his ear, “My lad, if you
would only spend your time training your horses instead of going to
cricket they would do you more credit and win more prizes.” This advice
I have never forgotten, and I pass it on for the benefit of those who
have yet to learn “the ropes.”




CHAPTER VI

REARING AND FEEDING


During the past few years we have heard much about early maturity with
all kinds of stock.Four-year-old bullocks are rarely seen in these
days, while wether sheep are being superseded by tegs.With Shire
Horses there has been a considerable amount of attention paid to size
in yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which, as before stated, is
equivalent to early maturity in the case of cattle and sheep.For the
purpose of getting size an animal must be well fed from birth, and this
applies to foals.Of course, the date of birth counts for a good deal
when foals are shown with their dams, as it does to a less extent with
yearlings, but after that age it makes very little difference whether a
foal is born in February or in May.From a farmer’s point of view I do not believe in getting Shire foals
too early.They have to be housed for a lengthened period, and the
dams fed on food which may be expensive.At the present time good oats
are worth 30_s._ per quarter, and hay, fit for horses, at least 90_s._
per ton, so that two or three months of winter feeding means a little
sum added to the cost of raising a foal.The middle of April is early enough for the average foal to arrive,
and he can then make quite a good size by September if his dam is an
ordinarily good suckler and he contracts no ailments, such as chills
or scour, to check his progress.When colts are a month old they will
begin to pick up crushed oats and bran while the dam is feeding,
therefore it is no trouble to teach them to eat from a manger.A word of caution is necessary to the inexperienced in the matter of
feeding the dam until the foal is a few days old and strong enough to
take all her milk.This is to feed the mare sparingly so as not to
flush her milk while the youngster is unable to take it fast enough.Of
course, the surplus can be milked away, as it should be if the bag is
tight, but this may be neglected and then scour is often set up, which
a very young foal often succumbs to.It is better that the mare should
have too little than too much milk while the youngster gets fairly on
his legs.Cows always have most of their milk taken away, but young lambs as well
as foals often suffer through taking too much of the dam’s milk during
the first day or two of their existence.If a foal is born during the grazing season the flow of milk can be
regulated by keeping the mare in a bare pasture, or shutting her up for
part of the day.Supposing that the foal survives the ills incidental to its early life,
and gains in strength with the lengthening days, its first dry food
will be taken when the mare is fed, which she should be, especially
if she is either a young or an old mare, while show candidates will
naturally need something more than grass.The object is to promote
steady growth and maintain good health, and it should not be forgotten
that oats are the best of all corn for horses; therefore no other kind
should be given to a foal, but on good grazing land a mare will usually
maintain herself and her foal in good condition for a good part of the
summer without manger food.It is towards weaning time that a manger is needed, into which should
be put crushed (not whole) oats, together with an equal quantity of
bran and a bit of good chaff.At the outset the mare will eat most of
it, but the foal will benefit by getting richer milk and more of it,
which he can now take without any ill effects.In time he acquires the
habit of standing up to the manger and taking his share.It is very
necessary to see that all foals eat well before they are weaned.The cost of feeding a foal during its first winter may be roughly
reckoned at ten shillings per week, which is made up as follows--

                             _s._ _d._

    80 lbs.of oats           6    0
    56    ”    hay            2    0
    28    ”    bran           1    6
    28    ”    oat straw      0    9
    28    ”    carrots        0    3

The bulk of the hay and all the oat straw should be fed in the form of
chaff with the oats, bran and carrots (well cleaned and pulped), then
a very good everyday diet can be formed by mixing the whole together,
and one which few horses will refuse.Of course the items are not
reckoned at the extreme prices prevailing in the winter of 1914-1915,
but they could often be bought for less, so that it is a fair average.It will be seen that oats form the biggest part, for the reason
aforesaid, that they are better than other kinds of corn.A little long hay should be given at night--more when there is snow on
the ground--the other mixture divided into two feeds per day, morning
and evening, unless showing is contemplated in the early Spring, when,
of course, an extra feed will be given at mid-day.The fashion has changed during the past few years as regards hay for
horses.Meadow hay is regarded, and rightly so, as too soft, so hard
seeds are invariably chosen by grooms or owners who want value for
money.It is quite easy to ascertain which a horse likes best by putting some
good hard mixture and equally well-gotten meadow hay side by side in
front of him.He will certainly eat that first which he likes best, and
it will be found to be the harder mixture.The quantities mentioned
are for foals which lie out or run on pasture.The best place for wintering them is in a paddock or field, with a
roomy shed open to the south.A yard, walled or slabbed on three sides,
the south again being open to the field, with doors wide enough to
admit a cart, is a very useful addition to the shed, as it is then
possible to shut the youngsters in when necessary.Both yard and shed should be kept littered, if straw is plentiful, but
if not the shed should contain a good bedding of peat-moss litter.No
overhead racks should be used, but one on the same level as the manger,
so that no seeds drop out of the rack into the colt’s eyes.It will be found that foals reared in this way are healthy and ready
for their feed, and they will often prefer to lie full length in
the open than to rest in the shed.To see them lying quite flat and
fast asleep, looking as if dead, is a pretty sure sign that they are
thriving.They will often snore quite loudly, so that a novice may
consider that they are ill.Rock salt should be within reach for them to lick, together with good
clean water.If a trough is used for the latter it should be cleaned
out at intervals, and if a pond or ditch is the drinking place, there
should be a stone mouth so as to avoid stalking in the mud.A healthy
horse is a hungry horse, therefore the feed should be cleaned up before
the next is put in.This must be noted in the case of foals just
weaned.Any left over should be taken away and given to older horses,
so that the little ones receive a sweet and palatable meal.Condition and bloom may be obtained by adding a small quantity of
boiled barley or a handful of linseed meal to the food above mentioned,
while horses lying in should have a boiled linseed and bran mash about
once a week.It should be remembered, as before stated, that horses are not like
cattle, sheep, or pigs, being fattened to be killed.They have a
comparatively long life in front of them, so that it is necessary to
build up a good constitution.Then they may change hands many times,
and if they pass from where cooked foods and condiments are largely
used to where plain food is given they are apt to refuse it and lose
flesh in consequence, thus leading the new owner to suppose that he
has got a bad bargain.Reference has already been made to the pernicious system of stuffing
show-animals, and it is not often that farmers err in this direction.They are usually satisfied with feeding their horses on sound and
wholesome home-grown food without purchasing costly extras to make
their horses into choice feeders.It is always better for the breeder of any class of stock if the
animals he sells give satisfaction to the purchasers, and this is
particularly true of Shire horses.A doubtful breeder or one which is
not all that it should be may be fattened up and sold at more than its
market value, but the buyer would not be likely to go to the same man
if he wanted another horse, therefore it is better to gain a reputation
for honest dealing and to make every effort to keep it.It might be here mentioned that it is not at all satisfactory to rear
a Shire foal by itself, even if it will stay in its paddock.It never
thrives as well as when with company, and often stands with its head
down looking very mopish and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is
not a suitable undertaking for a small holder, although he may keep
a good brood-mare to do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning
time.In the absence of a second foal a donkey is sometimes used as a
companion to a single one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory
playfellow, therefore the farmer with only one had far better sell it
straight from the teat, or if he has suitable accommodation he should
buy another to lie with it and rear the two together.Of course, two
will need more food than one, but no more journeys will be required to
carry it to the manger.Care should be taken, however, to buy one quite
as good, and if possible better, than the home-bred one.If they are to make geldings the colour should match, but if for
breeding purposes the colour need not necessarily be the same.Except
for making a working gelding, however, chestnuts should be avoided.It
is not a desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed enough of that
shade without buying one.A remark which may be also made with regard
to unsound ones, viz.that most horse-breeders get enough of them
without buying.During their second summer--that is as yearlings--Shires not wanted for
show purposes should be able to do themselves well at grass, supposing
the land is of average quality and not overstocked, but if the soil
is very poor it may be necessary to give a small feed once a day, of
which pulped mangolds may form a part if they are plentiful.This extra
feeding is better than stunting the growth, and the aim is to get a big
romping two-year-old colt, filly, or gelding as the case may be.Colts not up to the desired standard should be operated on during their
yearling days, preferably in May or June, and, as before indicated,
merit should be conspicuous in those left for stud purposes, while the
back breeding on both sides counts for much in a stallion.That is why
Lockinge Forest King, Childwick Champion, and a few others which could
be named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.After June or July colts should be separated from fillies unless the
colts have been castrated, and they must be put inside good fences,
this being something of a puzzle to a farmer with a few paddocks and
poor fences.Consequently, a second or third-rate young stallion often
causes a good deal of trouble, in fact, more than he leaves a return
for.For the second winter the young Shires still need a bit of help.If
they are to make, or are likely to make, anything out of the common
they should be fed liberally, otherwise a feed of chaff and corn once a
day will do, with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it must be good
wholesome forage.During their second spring, or when two years old, they should be put
to work as described in a former chapter, after which they are able at
least to earn their keep; the cost of rearing on the lines indicated up
to this age will be found to be considerable, so that a good saleable
animal is needed to make the business a profitable one; but I have kept
the rearing of good sound Shires in view, not crocks or mongrels.The effect of the war on the cost of feeding horses has led the Board
of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse owners
of substitutes for oats.When it was written beans were relatively
cheaper, so was maize, while rice-meal was recommended to form part of
the mixture, owing to its lower cost.Those who have fed horses are aware that they do not like any food
which is of a dusty nature.It sticks in their nostrils, causing them
annoyance, if not discomfort, which a horse indicates by blowing its
nose frequently.Any kind of light meal should therefore be fed either with damp chaff
or with pulped roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner described
elsewhere.If mangolds have to be purchased at £1 per ton, they help to
make the meals more palatable.The farmer who grows a variety of corn
and roots is usually able to prepare and blend his own foods so as to
make a diet on which horses will thrive although oats are scarce.In Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are largely used for farm horses,
but coal and labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.CHAPTER VII

CARE OF THE FEET


There is no part of a Shire to which more attention should be paid
than the feet, and it is safe to say that the foot of the present-day
cart-horse is infinitely better than were those of his ancestors of
forty, or even twenty, years ago.The shape as well as the size has
been improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is rarely met with, at least
in show animals of this breed.It is always advisable to keep the feet of foals, yearlings, and
two-year-olds attended to whether they are required for show or not,
and if they have their feet quietly picked up and the edges rasped, the
heels being lowered a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented from
breaking, and a better and more durable hoof well repays the trouble,
moreover the task of fixing the first set of shoes--which used to be
quite a tough job for the smith when the colts were neglected till
they were three years old--is rendered quite easy.Except for travelling on the road, or when required for show, there is
no advantage in keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they should be
taken off when lying idle, or if worked only on soft ground shoes are
not actually necessary.Where several are lying together, or even two, those with shoes on may
cause ugly wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with the naked hoof
is not often serious.There is also a possibility that colts turned
away to grass with their shoes on will have the removing neglected, and
thus get corns, so that the shoeless hoof is always better for young
Shires so long as it is sound and normal.If not, of course, it should
be treated accordingly.In a dry summer, when the ground is very hard, it may be advisable
to use tips so that the foot may be preserved, this being especially
necessary in the case of thin and brittle hoofs.For growing and preserving good strong feet in Shire horses clay land
seems to answer best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land farms
almost invariably possess tough horn on which a shoe can be affixed to
last till it wears out.For the purpose of improving weak feet in young Shires turning them out
in cool clay land may be recommended, taking care to assist the growth
by keeping the heels open so that the frog comes into contact with the
ground.Weakness in the feet has been regarded, and rightly so, as a bad fault
in a Shire stallion, therefore good judges have always been particular
to put bottoms first when judging.Horses of all kinds have to travel,
which they cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time if their
feet are ill-formed or diseased, and it should be borne in mind that
a good or a bad foot can be inherited.“No foot, no horse,” is an old
and true belief.During the past few years farmers have certainly paid
more attention to the feet of their young stock because more of them
are shown, the remarks of judges and critics having taught them that
a good top cannot atone for poor bottoms, seeing that Shires are not
like stationary engines, made to do their work standing.They have to
spend a good part of their lives on hard roads or paved streets, where
contracted or tender feet quickly come to grief, therefore those who
want to produce saleable Shires should select parents with the approved
type of pedals, and see that those of the offspring do not go wrong
through neglect or mismanagement.There is no doubt that a set of good feet often places an otherwise
moderate Shire above one which has other good points but lacks this
essential; therefore all breeders of Shires should devote time and
attention to the production of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering
the oft-quoted line, “The top may come, the bottom never.” In diseases
of the feet it is those in front which are the most certain to go
wrong, and it is these which judges and buyers notice more particularly.If fever manifests itself it is generally in the fore feet; while
side-bone, ring-bone, and the like are incidental to the front coronets.Clay land has been spoken of for rearing Shires, but there are various
kinds of soil in England, all of which can be utilized as a breeding
ground for the Old English type of cart-horses.In Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working red land, in Herts a
chalky soil prevails, yet champions abound there; while very light
sandy farms are capable of producing high-class Shires if the farmer
thereof sets his mind on getting them, and makes up for the poorness or
unsuitability of the soil by judicious feeding and careful management.It may be here stated that an arable farm can be made to produce a
good deal more horse forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,
therefore more horses can be kept on the former.Heavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne, etc., can be grown and mown
twice in the season, whereas grass can only be cut once.Oats and
oat straw are necessary, or at least desirable, for the rearing of
horses, so are carrots, golden tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an
arable-land farmer may certainly be a Shire horse breeder.This is getting away from the subject of feet, however, and it may be
returned to by saying that stable management counts for a good deal in
the growth and maintenance of a sound and healthy hoof.Good floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet in which roots appear,
moving shoes at regular intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not
rasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow shoe, may be mentioned as
aids in retaining good feet.As stated, the improvement in this particular has been very noticeable
since the writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but perfection
has not yet been reached, therefore it remains for the breeders of the
present and the future to strive after it.There was a time when exhibitors of “Agricultural” horses stopped the
cracks and crevices in their horses’ feet with something in the nature
of putty, which is proved by reading a report of the Leeds Royal of
1861, where “the judges discovered the feet of one of the heavy horses
to be stopped with gutta-percha and pitch.”




CHAPTER VIII

HOW TO SHOW A SHIRE


A few remarks on the above subject will not come amiss, at least to
the uninitiated, for it is tolerably certain that, other things being
equal, the candidate for honours which makes the best show when it is
actually before the judges stands the first chance of securing the
honours.It must not be expected that a colt can be fetched out of a grass field
one day and trained well enough to show himself off creditably in the
ring the next; and a rough raw colt makes both itself and its groom
look small.Training properly takes time and patience, and it is best
to begin early with the process, from birth for choice.The lessons
need not, and certainly should not, be either long or severe at the
outset, but just enough to teach the youngster what is required of him.When teaching horses to stand at “attention” they should not be made to
stretch themselves out as if they were wanted to reach from one side
of the ring to the other, neither should they be allowed to stand like
an elephant on a tub.They should be taught to stand squarely on all
fours in a becoming and businesslike way.The best place for the groom
when a horse is wanted to stand still is exactly in front and facing
the animal.The rein is usually gripped about a foot from the head.Mares can often be allowed a little more “head,” but with stallions
it may be better to take hold close to the bit, always remembering to
have the loop end of the rein in the palm, in case he suddenly rears
or plunges.The leader should “go with his horse,” or keep step with
him, but need not “pick up” in such a manner as to make it appear to
bystanders that he is trying to make up for the shortcomings of his
horse.Both horse and man want to practise the performance in the home paddock
a good many times before perfection can be reached, and certainly
a little time thus spent is better than making a bad show when the
critical moment arrives that they are both called out to exhibit
themselves before a crowd of critics.If well trained the horse will respond to the call of the judges with
only a word, and no whip or stick need be used to get it through the
required walks and trots, or back to its place in the rank.There is a class of men who would profit by giving a little time to
training young horse stock, and that is the farmers who breed but do
not show.Of course, “professional show-men” (as they are sometimes
called) prefer to “buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the polish
themselves, and then take the profits for so doing.But why should not
the breeder make his animals show to their very best, and so get a
better price into his own pocket?Finally, I would respectfully suggest that if some of the horse show
societies were to have a horse-showing competition, _i.e._ give prizes
to the men who showed out a horse in the best manner, it would be both
interesting and instructive to horse lovers.CHAPTER IX

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SHIRE


It is evident that a breed of comparatively heavy horses existed in
Britain at the time of the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s
warriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were on foot) in war chariots
drawn by active but powerful horses, remarkable--as Sir Walter Gilbey’s
book on “The Great Horse” says--for “strength, substance, courage and
docility.”

These characteristics have been retained and improved upon all down the
ages since.The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow down the
enemy was superseded by regiments of cavalry, the animals ridden being
the Old English type of War Horse.In those days it was the lighter or
second-rate animals, what we may call “the culls,” which were left for
agricultural purposes.The English knight, when clad in armour, weighed
something like 4 cwt., therefore a weedy animal would have sunk under
such a burden.This evidently forced the early breeders to avoid long backs by
breeding from strong-loined, deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,
seeing that slackness meant weakness and, therefore, worthlessness for
war purposes.It is easy to understand that a long-backed, light-middled mount with
a weight of 4 cwt.on his back would simply double up when stopped
suddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe at the head of his
antagonist, so we find from pictures and plates that the War Horse of
those far-off days was wide and muscular in his build, very full in his
thighs, while the saddle in use reached almost from the withers to the
hips, thus proving that the back was short.There came a time, however, when speed and mobility were preferred to
mere weight.The knight cast away his armour and selected a lighter and
fleeter mount than the War Horse of the ancient Britons.The change was, perhaps, began at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314.It is recorded that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that battle, on
which he dodged the charges of the ponderous English knights, and
he took a very heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of their
massive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable to suppose that some
of the latter were used for breeding purposes, and thus helped to build
up the Scottish, or Clydesdale, breed of heavy horses; but what was
England’s loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale breed had
a class devoted to it at the Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas
his English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive recognition by the
Royal Agricultural Society of England till 1883, sixty years later.As
a War Horse the British breed known as “The Great Horse” seems to have
been at its best between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the date of
Bannockburn above-mentioned, owing to the fact that the Norman nobles,
who came over with William the Conqueror, fought on horseback, whereas
the Britons of old used to dismount out of their chariots, and fight on
foot.The Battle of Hastings was waged between Harold’s English Army of
infantry-men and William the Conqueror’s Army of horsemen, ending in a
victory for the latter.The Flemish horses thus became known to English horse breeders, and
they were certainly used to help lay the foundation of the Old English
breed of cart horses.It is clear that horses with substance were used for drawing chariots
at the Roman invasion in the year 55 B.C., but no great development
in horse-breeding took place in England till the Normans proved that
warriors could fight more effectively on horseback than on foot.After
this the noblemen of England appear to have set store by their horses,
consequently the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be regarded
as the age in which Britain’s breed of heavy horses became firmly
established.In Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation showing that “Cart Horses
fit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot” were on sale at
Smithfield (London) every Friday, the extract being made from a book
written about 1154, and from the same source we learn that during the
reign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred stallions “of large stature”
were imported from the low countries--Flanders and Holland.Passing from this large importation to the time of the famous Robert
Bakewell of Dishley (1726-1795), we find that he too went to Flanders
for stock to improve his cart horses, but instead of returning
with stallions he bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,
these being of the old black breed peculiar--in those days--to
Leicestershire.There is no doubt that the interest taken by this great
breed improver in the Old English type of cart horse had an effect far
more important than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed of cattle,
seeing that this has long lost its popularity, whereas that of the
Shire horse has been growing and widening from that day to this.Bakewell was the first English stockbreeder to let his stud animals for
the season, and although his greatest success was achieved with the
Dishley or “New Leicester” sheep, he also carried on the system with
Longhorn bulls and his cart horses, which were described as “Bakewell’s
Blacks.”

That his horses had a reputation is proved by the fact that in 1785
he had the honour of exhibiting a black horse before King George III.James’s Palace, but another horse named “K,” said by Marshall
to have died in that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen years,
was described by the writer just quoted as a better animal than that
inspected by His Majesty the King.From the description given he
appears to have had a commanding forehand and to have carried his head
so high that his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore feet, as
Bakewell held that the head of a cart horse should.It can hardly be
questioned that he was a believer in weight, seeing that his horses
were “thick and short in body, on very short legs.”

The highest price he is credited with getting for the hire of a
stallion for a season is 150 guineas, while the service fee at home is
said to have been five guineas, which looks a small amount compared
with the 800 guineas obtained for the use of his ram “Two Pounder” for
a season.What is of more importance to Shire horse breeders, however, is the
fact that Robert Bakewell not only improved and popularized the Shire
horse of his day, but he instituted the system of letting out sires
for the season, which has been the means of placing good sires before
farmers, thus enabling them to assist in the improvement which has made
such strides since the formation of the Shire Horse Society in 1878.It is worth while to note that Bakewell’s horses were said to be
“perfectly gentle, willing workers, and of great power.” He held that
bad pullers were made so by bad management.He used two in front of
a Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being “four acres a day.”
Surely a splendid advertisement for the Shire as a plough horse.FLEMISH BLOOD

In view of the fact that Flanders has been very much in the public eye
for the past few months owing to its having been converted into a vast
battlefield, it is interesting to remember that we English farmers of
to-day owe at least something of the size, substance and soundness of
our Shire horses to the Flemish horse breeders of bygone days.Bakewell
is known to have obtained marvellous results among his cattle and sheep
by means of in-breeding, therefore we may assume that he would not have
gone to the Continent for an outcross for his horses unless he regarded
such a step beneficial to the breed.It is recorded by George Culley that a certain Earl of Huntingdon had
returned from the Low Countries--where he had been Ambassador--with a
set of black coach horses, mostly stallions.These were used by the
Trentside farmers, and without a doubt so impressed Bakewell as to
induce him to pay a visit to the country whence they came.If we turn from the history of the Shire to that of the Clydesdale it
will be found that the imported Flemish stallions are credited by the
most eminent authorities, with adding size to the North British breed
of draught horses.The Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous for their interest in horse
breeding.One was said to have imported six black Flemish stallions--to
cross with the native mares--towards the close of the seventeenth
century, while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported one, which he
named “Clyde.”

This is notable, because it proves that both the English and Scotch
breeds have obtained size from the very country now devastated by war.It may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders
of heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke
of Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the
Shire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which
have done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr.Robert Bakewell,
had the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)
before Royalty.Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland
Counties of England.So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a
winner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the
next station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the
likely animal.On at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,
so the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough
from the carriage window on the railway.Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr.Drew in
England was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.This horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he
also begot Lincolnshire Lad II.1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion
of the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion
in London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),
Markeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the
Shires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other
celebrities.Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,
by Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and
the dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all
of which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.There is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than
Flanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the
Flemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour
where it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read
of deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses
in Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing
feature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.CHAPTER X

FACTS AND FIGURES


The London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.The entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.This led to the
adoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two
entries in one class.The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the
number of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the
total being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in
the latter year than in the former.Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in
London was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of
charging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.Another innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered
for show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form
of certificate drawn up:--

    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr.________ for
    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,
    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the
    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),
    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,
    Sidebone, Shivering.”

These alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at
which the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited
by a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who
served on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).But to hark back to
the 1890 Show.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s
(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the
Sort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the
second-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.The Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr.R. N.
Sutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,
for 925 guineas to Mr.Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the
Shire Horse world for several years.Starlight rewarded him by winning
Champion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories
being a record in championships for females at the London Show.Others
have won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.In 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the
amount given in prizes being just over £700.A curious thing about that
1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of
£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their
thousands as they do now.The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and
the entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time
this is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of
1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her
Allies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been
carried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the
country cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression
that “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any
method of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally
to the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly
that which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among
members of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in
existence.At the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to
the prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two
geldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most
notable feature being that Mr.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won
the Challenge Cup for mares and died later.Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the
eldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,
the yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.But for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the
yearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age.At
this show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of
winning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other
two, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,
and son, viz.Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this
made the victory particularly noteworthy.The last named also succeeded
in winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.The cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours
the previous year for Mr.W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful
if a better gelding has been exhibited since.He was also cup winner
again in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the
London Show.It should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes
was introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced
from £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those
for mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each
breeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare
£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.This was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire
Horse Society and its London Show a lift up in the eyes of farmers
who had bred Shires but had not exhibited.Since then they have never
lost their claim on any good animal they have bred, that is why they
flock to the Show in February from all parts of England, and follow the
judging with such keen interest; there is money in it.This Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of the most important ever held.It marked the beginning of a more democratic era in the history of the
Great Horse.The sum of £1142 was well spent.By the year 1900 the prize money had reached a total of £1322, the
classes remaining as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for
mares, and two for geldings.The next year, 1901, another class, for
mares 16 hands 2 inches and over, was added, and also another class
for geldings, resulting in a further rise to £1537 in prize money.The sensation of this Show was the winning of the Championship by new
tenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs.J. and M. Walwyn, with an unknown
two-year-old colt, Bearwardcote Blaze.This was a bigger surprise than
the success of Rokeby Harold as a yearling in 1893, as he had won
prizes for his breeder, Mr.A. C. Rogers, and for Mr.John Parnell
(at Ashbourne) before getting into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore
great things were expected of him, whereas the colt Bearwardcote Blaze
was a veritable “dark horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one of
the judges, and subsequently purchased him for Lord Ellesmere.The winning of the Championship by a yearling colt was much commented
on at the time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary colt.The
critics of that day regarded him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.Said one, “We breed Shire horses every day, but a colt like this comes
only once in a lifetime.” Fortunately I saw him both in London and at
the Chester Royal, where he was also Champion, my interest being all
the greater because he was bred in Bucks, close to where I “sung my
first song.”

Of two-year-old champions there have been at least four, viz.Prince
William, in 1885; Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze, 1901; and
Champion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.Three-year-olds have also won supreme honours fairly often.Those
within the writer’s recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,
after being first in his class for the two previous years, and reserve
champion in 1891; Rokeby Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,
and cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in 1899, thus repeating his
two-year-old performance; Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the Royal
Champion as a two-year-old.The 1909 Show was remarkable for the successes of Lord Rothschild, who
after winning one of the championships for the previous six years, now
took both of the Challenge Cups, the reserve championship, and the Cup
for the best old stallion.The next and last three-year-old to win was, or is, the renowned
Champion’s Goalkeeper, who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the
second time.When comparing the ages of the male and female champions of the London
Show, it is seen that while the former often reach the pinnacle of
fame in their youth, the latter rarely do till they have had time to
develop.CHAPTER XI

HIGH PRICES


It is not possible to give particulars of sums paid for many animals
sold privately, as the amount is often kept secret, but a few may be
mentioned.The first purchase to attract great attention was that of
Prince William, by the late Lord Wantage from Mr.John Rowell in 1885
for £1500, or guineas, although Sir Walter Gilbey had before that given
a real good price to Mr.W. R. Rowland for the Bucks-bred Spark.The
next sensational private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the Royal
Champion of 1891, to Mr.Joseph Wainwright, the seller again being
Mr.John Rowell and the price 2500 guineas.In that same year, 1891,
Chancellor, one of Premier’s noted sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale at Calwich, when eighteen of Premier’s sons and
daughters were paraded with their sire, and made an average, including
foals, of £273 each.In 1892 a record in letting was set up by the Welshpool Shire Horse
Society, who gave Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan (the
champion of the 1891 London Show) to serve 100 mares.This society
was said to be composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected a good
return for their money.” Since then a thousand pounds for a first-class
sire has been paid many times, and it is in districts where they have
been used that those in search of the best go for their foals.Two
notable instances can be mentioned, viz.Champion’s Goalkeeper and
Lorna Doone, the male and female champions of the London Show of 1914,
which were both bred in the Welshpool district.Other high-priced
stallions to be sold by auction in the nineties were Marmion to Mr.Arkwright in 1892 for 1400 guineas, Waresley
Premier Duke to Mr.Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of Devonshire) for
1100 guineas at Mr.W. H. O. Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum
by the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s Hendre Crown Prince in the
same year.For the next really high-priced stallion we must come to the dispersion
of the late Lord Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley purchased the five-year-old Tatton Dray King (London Champion
in 1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated Devonshire stud.At this sale Tatton Herald, a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to
Messrs.Ainscough, who won the championship with him at the Liverpool
Royal in 1910, but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured, and won, as a
gelding.As a general rule, however, these costly sires have proved well worth
their money.As mentioned previously, the year 1913 will be remembered by the
fact that 4100 guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale for the
two-year-old Shire colt Champion’s Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion,
who, like Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to prove a good
investment at his cost.Twice since then he has championed the London
Show, and by the time these lines are read he may have accomplished
that great feat for the third time, his age being four years old in
1915.Of mares, Starlight, previously mentioned, was the first to approach a
thousand pounds in an auction sale.At the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late Mr.Philo Mills exhibited
Moonlight, a mare which he had purchased privately for £1000, but she
only succeeded in getting a commended card, so good was the company in
which she found herself.The first Shire mare to make over a thousand
guineas at a stud sale was Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold.This was at
the second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894, the price being 1010 guineas,
and the purchaser Mr.W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen, from whom
she was repurchased by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again
included in the Dunsmore catalogue of January 27, 1898, when she
realized 780 guineas, Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,
the word being used because she won the challenge cup in London, both
in 1899 and 1900.Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by Harold (London
Champion), dam by Staunton Hero (London Champion), she was sold at
King Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200 guineas.As a three- and
a four-year-old she was second in London, and she also won second
prize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A. Muntz, finally winning supreme
honours at nine and ten years of age, a very successful finish to a
distinguished career.On February 11th, 1898, another record was set by
His Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old filly Sea Breeze, by
the same sire as Bearwardcote Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J. Blundell
Maple again being the buyer.The next mare to make four figures at a
stud sale was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge sale of February
14, 1900, the successful bidder being Mr.H. H. Smith-Carington,
Ashby Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought and bred many good
Shires.This date, February 14, seems to
be a particularly lucky one for Shire sales, for besides the one just
mentioned Lord Rothschild has held at least two sales on February 14.In 1908 the yearling colt King Cole VII.was bought by the late Lord
Winterstoke for 900 guineas, the highest price realized by the stud
sales of that year.Then there is the record sale at Tring Park on
February 14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions Goalkeeper, made 4100
guineas, and another, Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.The honour for being the highest priced Shire mare sold at a stud sale
belongs to the great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir Arthur
Nicholson gave 1200 guineas at the dispersion sale of Mr.Max Michaelis
at Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911.It will be remembered by
Shire breeders that she made a successful appearance in London each
year from one to eight years old, her list being: First, as a yearling;
sixth, as a two-year-old; second, as a three-year-old; first and
reserve champion at four years old, five and seven; first in her class
at six.She was not to be denied the absolute championship, however,
and it fell to her in 1911.No Shire in history has achieved greater
distinction than this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won first prize
at the Royal Show six years in succession, as the competition in those
far-off days was much less keen than that which Pailton Sorais had to
face, and it should be mentioned that she was also a good breeder,
the foal by her side when she was sold made 310 guineas and another
daughter 400 guineas.Such are the kind of Shire mares that farmers want.Those that will
work, win, and breed.As we have seen in this incomplete review, Aurea
won the championship of the London show, together with her son.Belle
Cole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt which realized 900 guineas
as a yearling a few days before she herself gained her victory, a clear
proof that showing and breeding are not incompatible.CHAPTER XII

A FEW RECORDS


The highest priced Shires sold by auction have already been given.So a
few of the most notable sales may be mentioned, together with the dates
they were held--

                                                     £   _s._ _d._

    Tring Park (draft), January 12, 1898:
                               35 Shires averaged   209  18    2
    Dunsmore (dispersion), February 11, 1909:

    Tandridge (dispersion), October 28, 1911:
                               84 Shires averaged   188  17    6

These ten are worthy of special mention, although there are several
which come close up to the £200 average.That given first is the most
noteworthy for the reason that Lord Rothschild only sold a portion of
his stud, whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton of Tatton
sold their whole lot of twenty-one head, hence the higher average.Two clear records were, however, set up at the historical Tring Park
sale in 1913, viz.the highest individual price for a stallion and the
highest average price for animals by one sire, seven sons and daughters
of Childwick Champion, making no less than £927 each, including two
yearling colts.The best average of the nineteenth century was that made at its close
by the late Lord Llangattock, who had given a very high price privately
for Prince Harold, by Harold, which, like his sire, was a very
successful stock horse, his progeny making a splendid average at this
celebrated sale.A spirited bidder at all of the important sales and a
very successful exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed in winning
either of the London Championships.One private sale during 1900 is worth mentioning, which was that of Mr.James Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon Extraordinary and Barrow
Farmer for 225 guineas each, a price which has only been equalled once
to the writer’s knowledge.This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.Truman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at Messrs.Manley’s Repository,
Crewe, this specimen of the English lorry horse being bought for export
to the United States.In 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a sale which possessed unique
features in that fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the dual
London Champion and Windsor Royal (Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner,
Prince William, to whom reference has already been made.As a great supporter of the old English breed, Lord
Wantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran, deserves to be bracketed with the
recently deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that in 1890 he gave
the Lockinge Cup for the best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,
which Starlight succeeded in winning outright for Mr.Sir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup for the best stallion, value
100 guineas, in 1884, which, however, was not won permanently till the
late Earl of Ellesmere gained his second championship with Vulcan in
1891.Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has continued to give
the Challenge Cups both for the best stallion and mare.The sales hitherto mentioned have been those of landowners, but it must
not be supposed that tenant farmers have been unable to get Shires
enough to call a home sale.A. H. Clark sold
fifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate, the average being £127 5_s._, the
striking feature of this sale being the number of grey (Thumper) mares.F. W. Griffin, another very
successful farmer breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,
the former’s average being £100 6_s._ 9_d._, and the latter’s £123
9_s._ 8_d._, each selling twenty-five animals.The last home sale held by a farmer was that of Mr.Mary went back to the bedroom.Matthew Hubbard
at Eaton, Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an average of £73 was
obtained for fifty-seven lots.Reference has already been made to Harold, Premier, and Prince William,
as sires, but there have been others equally famous since the Shire
Horse Society has been in existence.Among them may be mentioned Bar
None, who won at the 1882 London Show for the late Mr.James Forshaw,
stood for service at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a dozen
seasons, and is credited with having sired over a thousand foals.They
were conspicuous for flat bone and silky feather, when round cannon
bones and curly hair were much more common than they are to-day,
therefore both males and females by Bar None were highly prized; £2000
was refused for at least one of his sons, while a two-year-old daughter
made 800 guineas in 1891.For several years the two sires of Mr.A. C.
Duncombe, at Calwich, Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and in
those days the Ashbourne Foal Show was worth a journey to see.In 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first prize in London with a
big-limbed yearling, Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the sire
of strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds, which carried all
before them in the show ring for several years, and a three-year-old
son made the highest price ever realized at any of the Dunsmore Sales,
when the stud was dispersed in 1909.This was 1025 guineas given by
Lord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II.For four years in succession,
1903 to 1906, Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number of winners, not
only in London, but at all the principal shows.His service fee was
fifteen guineas to “approved mares only,” a high figure for a horse
which had only won at the Shire Horse Show as a yearling.Among others
he sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion
mare at the London Shows of 1912 and 1913.Jameson contained the blood
of Lincolnshire Lad on both sides of his pedigree.By the 1907 show
another sire had come to the front, and his success was phenomenal;
this was Lockinge Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage in 1889,
purchased by the late Mr.J. P. Cross, of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who
won first prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him in London as
a three-year-old, also first and champion at the (Carlisle) Royal
Show the same year, 1902.It is worth while to study the breeding of
Lockinge Forest King._Sire_--Lockinge Manners._Great grand sire_--Harold._Great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad II._Great great great grand sire_--Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).The dam of Lockinge Forest King was The Forest Queen (by Royal Albert,
1885, a great sire in his day); she was first prize winner at the Royal
Show, Nottingham, 1888, first and champion, Peterborough, 1888, first
Bath and West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other prizes.Her dam traced
back to (Dack’s) Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an authority
than the late Mr.James Forshaw described as “the sire of all time.”

This accounts for the marvellous success of Lockinge Forest King as a
stud horse, although his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late in
his life of ten years.We have already seen that he
has sired the highest priced Shire mare publicly sold.At the Newcastle
Royal of 1908, both of the gold medal winners were by him, so were
the two champions at the 1909 Shire Horse Show.His most illustrious
family was bred by a tenant farmer, Mr.John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,
Leicester.The eldest member is Halstead Royal Duke, the London
Champion of 1909, Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910, both owned
by Lord Rothschild, and Halstead Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup
in London for her breeder in 1912.The dam of the trio is Halstead
Duchess III by Menestrel, by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion, 1890).Two other matrons deserve to be mentioned, as they will always shine in
the history of the Shire breed.One is Lockington Beauty by Champion
457, who died at a good old age at Batsford Park, having produced
Prince William, the champion referred to more than once in these pages,
his sire being William the Conqueror.Then Marmion II (by Harold),
who was first in London in 1891, and realized 1400 guineas at Mr.Also a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at London Show
of 1889 for Mr.R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but, unfortunately, died from
foaling in that year.Another famous son was Mars Victor, a horse of
great size, and also a London winner, on more than one occasion.Freeman-Mitford (Lord
Redesdale) in the year of his sire’s--Hitchin Conqueror’s--championship
in 1890, for the sum of £1500.Blue Ruin was own sister to Prince William, but the other three were by
different sires.To look at--I saw her in 1890--Lockington Beauty was quite a common
mare with obviously small knees, and none too much weight and width,
her distinguishing feature being a mane of extraordinary length.The remaining dam to be mentioned as a great breeder is Nellie
Blacklegs by Bestwick’s Prince, famous for having bred five sons--which
were all serving mares in the year 1891--and a daughter, all by
Premier.The first was Northwood, a horse used long and successfully by
Lord Middleton and the sire of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall
Menestrel, London champion of 1904.The second, Hydrometer, first
in London in 1889, then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough, and
purchased when his stud was dispersed in 1893 by the Warwick Shire
Horse Society for 600 guineas.A.
C. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for 1100 guineas, a record in those days,
to Mr.F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough Society in 1892 for
£500.Calwich Topsman, another son, realized 500 guineas when sold, and
Senator made 350.The daughter, rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr.John
Smith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal by Harold in 1893, which
turned out to be Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion stallion of 1897.This chapter was headed “A few records,” and surely this set up by
Premier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.The record show of the Shire Horse Society, as regards the number of
entries, was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the next for size was
the 1902 meeting when 860 were catalogued.Of course the smallest
show was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions and 34 mares made
a total of 110 entries.The highest figure yet made in the public
auction sales held at the London Show is 1175 guineas given by Mr.R. Heath, Biddulph Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming
King, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord Winterstoke, and sold by
his executors, after having won fourth in his class, although first
and reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old.He was sired by
Ravenspur, with which King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,
his price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke at the Wolferton Sale
of February 8, 1907, being the highest at any sale of that year.The
lesson to be learned is that if you want to create a record with Shires
you must begin and continue with well-bred ones, or you will never
reach the desired end.CHAPTER XIII

C., Newton Solney, Burton-on-Trent.Green, Edward, The Moors, Welshpool.Mackereth, Henry Whittington, Kirkby Lonsdale, Lancs.This list is interesting for the reason that those who have awarded
the prizes at the Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent, fixed the
type to find favour at other important shows.Very often the same
judges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the
same season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning
Shires.On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its
Council from as many counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection.For instance, Warwickshire--a great
county for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them--Mr.Potter--had recently come from Lockington
Grounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William.For many
years Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has
hailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number
of breeders of Shire horses.No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out.It is no light task, and nobody
but an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,
and Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,
whereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book
is 4200.The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their
old title of “War Horses.”




CHAPTER XIV

THE EXPORT TRADE


Among the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of
the Shire were the Americans.Very few London shows had been held
before they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take
across the Atlantic.Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse
Society granted 1264 export certificates.A society to safeguard the
interests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks
of Mr.A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in
his introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have
first-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour
to secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of
enhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England
and America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by
exercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to
pedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only
reap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to
this country.”

From the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June
3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of
Canada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the
merits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many
good Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was
118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United
States and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire
Classes.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done
is Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to
fifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be
extended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about
the stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore
they have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their
breeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to
extinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for
building up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred
re-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910
the number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if
the export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,
English breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British
Empire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial
prizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire
Horse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign
and Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES

The following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”
for 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--

    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is
    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal
    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,
    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,
    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in
    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire
    horses became known, and the more they came into competition
    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught
    purposes were appreciated.’

    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have
    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of
    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,
    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire
    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries
    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade
    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further
    development.The number of export certificates granted by the
    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal
    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire
    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,
    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,
    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and
    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a
    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,
    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,
    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more
    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present
    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings
    continue to be scarce and dear.”


THE NUMBER EXPORTED

“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year
or two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those
that go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is
worked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the
admiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,
except in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers
is to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than
on the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put
are also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very
high prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same
spirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal
could be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire
it is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is
unquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most
important horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the
breed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial
farmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a
similar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large
railway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a
binder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West
Territory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in
the stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are
keeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough
for their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only
kind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which
is certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the
native draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING

“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,
which is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire
horse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows
like Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at
the best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an
increase in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of
a thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;
but the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be
over, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have
declined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the
record average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general
average for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the
highest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being
1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre
Champion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and
Chancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,
1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases
of Mr.These figures show that the
worth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and
it is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is
by no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there
is ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in
view and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions
it behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American
word, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they
come to ‘the stud farm of the world.’

“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock
which has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly
emphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British
market being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of
males, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which
breeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood
famous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as
showing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after
year if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of
merit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply
of mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring
societies, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade
sires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,
and the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS

“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for
Shires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,
but from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either
forming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not
been responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable
that with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western
Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to
help the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be
useful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well
known, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an
average of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British
breeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest
fairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus
further the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the
export trade.”

It may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and
Lord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of
America for exhibition.CHAPTER XV

PROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS


Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge
cups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name
is mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show
of 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased
the second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.)He is
remembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short
legs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been
found at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan
and Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the
Filly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a
very high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,
which won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him
750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord
Rothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in
1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as
models of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in
1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win
highest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through
Lord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as
a two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,
so we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central
figure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Woldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the
Tring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire
Horse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased
Windley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the
Tandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the
Lockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir
Walpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King
blood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at
the Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a
brilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.
Ewart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at
Peterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt
deserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD

At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased
Dunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,
for 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won
second and third for him in London the same month, this being the first
show at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by
Messrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas
created quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so
for nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is
Mollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is
Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased
privately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines
is Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,
won first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards
selling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With
such animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,
although they do not come from the district known to the law makers of
old as the breeding ground of �
