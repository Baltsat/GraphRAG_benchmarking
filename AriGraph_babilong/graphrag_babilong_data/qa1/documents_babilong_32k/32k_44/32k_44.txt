The storm had ceased, but the wind sobbed and moaned through the trees
like a thing of life, sighing one moment like a person in anguish, and
then wailing like a lost soul.An owl near by added its solemn hootings
to the already dismal night.Fred felt Ferror shudder and try to creep
still closer to him.Both boys remained silent for a long time, but at
length Fred said:

"Ferror, shooting that sentinel was awful.I had almost rather have
remained a prisoner."I did not know the sentinel was there," answered Ferror, "or I could
have avoided him.As it was, it had to be done.It was a case of life or
death.Fred, do you know who the sentinel was?""It was Drake; I saw his face by the flash of my pistol, just for a
second, but it was enough.I can see it now," and he shuddered."No, Ferror; if I had been in your place, I might have done the same,
but that would have made it none the less horrible.""Fred, you will despise me; but I must tell you.""Drake is not the first man I have killed to-night."Fred sprang up and involuntarily drew away from him."After I was relieved from guard, and before I joined you, I stabbed
Captain Bascom through the heart."A low cry of horror escaped Fred's lips."Listen to my story, Fred, and then despise me as a murderer if you
will.My mother is a widow, residing in Tazewell county, Virginia.I am
an only son, but I have two lovely sisters.I was always headstrong,
liking my own way.Of course, I was humored and petted.When the war
broke out I was determined to enlist.My mother and sisters wept and
prayed, and at last I promised to wait.But about two months ago I was
down at Abingdon, and was asked to take a glass of wine.I think it was
drugged, for when I came to myself I found that I was an enlisted
soldier.Worse than all, I found that this man Bascom was an officer in
the company to which I belonged.Bascom is a low-lived, drunken brute.Mother had him arrested for theft
and sent to jail.When he got out, he left the neighborhood, but swore
he would have revenge on every one of the name.I think he was in hopes that by brutal treatment he could make me
desert, so he could have me shot if captured.When he struck me the
other day, when I spoke to you, I resolved then and there to kill him.""I know," replied Fred, in a low tone."God only knows what I have suffered from the hands of that man during
the last two months.I have had provocation enough to kill him a
thousand times.""I know, I know," replied Fred; "but to kill him in his sleep.I would
not have blamed you if you had shot him down when he gave you that blow."It would have been best," sobbed Ferror, for the first time giving way
to his feelings."Oh, mother, what will you think of your boy!"Then he
said, chokingly: "Fred, don't desert me, don't despise me; I can't bear
it.I believe if you turn from me now, I shall become one of the most
desperate of criminals.""No, Ferror," said Fred; "I will neither desert nor judge you.You have
done something I had rather lose my life than do.But for the present
our fortunes are linked together.If we are captured, both will suffer
an ignominious death.Therefore, much as I abhor your act, I cannot
divorce myself from the consequences.Then let us resolve, come what
may, we will never be taken alive."Ferror grasped Fred's hand, and pressing it fervently, replied: "If we
are captured, it will only be my dead body which will be taken, even if
I have to send a bullet through my own heart."After this the boys said little, and silently waited for the light.With the first gleam of the morning, they started on their way, thinking
only of getting as far as possible from the scene of that night of
horror.As the sun arose, the mountains and then the valleys were flooded with
its golden light.At any other time the glorious landscape spread out
before them would have filled Fred's soul with delight; but as it was,
he only eagerly scanned the road which ran through the valley, hoping to
catch sight of Nelson's advancing columns."They will surely come before long," said Fred."By ten o'clock we
should be inside of the Federal lines and safe."But if Fred had heard what was passing in the Rebel camp he would not
have been so sanguine.Lieutenant Davis, officer of the guard, and Colonel Williams were in
close consultation."Colonel," said the lieutenant, "I do not believe the Yankees are
pursuing us.Those boys will take it for granted that we will continue
our retreat, and will soon come down off the mountains into the road.Let me take a couple of companies of cavalry, and I will station men in
ambush along the road as far back as it is safe to go.In this way I
believe we stand a chance to catch them."The colonel consented, and, therefore, before the sun had lighted up the
valley, pickets had been placed along the road for several miles back.The boys trailed along the mountain side until nearly noon, but the
sides of the mountain were so seamed and gashed they made slow progress.Gaining a high point, they looked towards Piketon, and in the far
distance saw an advancing column of cavalry."There is nothing to be seen to the south," said Fred."I think we can
descend to the road in safety."So they cautiously made their way down
to the road."Let us look well to our arms," said Fred."We must be prepared for any
emergency."So their revolvers were carefully examined, fresh caps put in, and every
precaution taken.They came out on the road close to a little valley
farm.In front of the cabin stood a couple of horses hitched.After
carefully looking at the horses, Ferror said: "Fred, one of those horses
belongs to Lieutenant Davis.He has ridden back to see if he could not
catch sight of us.Nelson's men will soon send him back flying."Then a wild idea took possession of the boys.It was no less than to try
and get possession of the horses.Wouldn't it be grand to enter the
Federal lines in triumph, riding the horses of their would-be captors!Without stopping to think of the danger, they at once acted on the idea.From the cabin came sounds of laughter mingled with the music of women's
voices.Getting near the horses, the boys made a dash, were on their backs in a
twinkling, and with a yell of triumph were away.The astonished
officers rushed to the door, only to see them disappear down the road.Then they raged like madmen, cursing their fortunes, and calling down
all sorts of anathemas on the boys."Never mind," at last said Sergeant Jones, who was the lieutenant's
companion in misfortune, "the squad down the road will catch them.""Poor consolation for the disgrace of having our horses stolen," snapped
the lieutenant.The elation of the boys came to a sudden ending.In the road ahead of
them stood a squad of four horsemen.Involuntarily the boys checked the
speed of their horses.They looked into each other's faces, they read
each other's thoughts."It can only be death," said Fred."It can only be death," echoed Ferror, "and I welcome it.I know, Fred,
you look on me as a murderer.I want to show you how I can die in a fair
fight."Fred hardly realized what Ferror was saying; he was debating a plan of
attack."Ferror," he said, "let us ride leisurely forward until we get within
about fifty yards of them.No doubt they know the horses, and will be
nonplused as to who we are.It will be
all over in a moment--safety or death."He was as pale as his victims of the night before, but
his eyes blazed, his teeth were set hard, every muscle was strained.Just as Fred turned to say, "Now!"Ferror shouted, "Good-bye, Fred,"
and dashed straight for the horsemen.The movement was so sudden it left
Fred slightly behind.The revolvers of the four Confederates blazed, but
like a thunderbolt Ferror was on them.The first man and horse went down
like a tenpin before the ball of the bowler; the second, and boy and man
and both horses went down in an indistinguishable mass together.As for Fred, not for a second did he lose command of himself or his
horse.He saw what was coming, and swerved to the right.Here a single
Confederate confronted him.This man's attention had been attracted for
a moment to the fate of his comrades in the road, and before he knew it
Fred was on him.He raised his smoking revolver to fire, but Fred's
revolver spoke first, and the soldier reeled and fell from his saddle.The road was now open for Fred to escape, but he wheeled his horse and
rode back to see what had become of his comrade.One Confederate still
sat on his horse unhurt.Seeing Fred, he raised his pistol and fired.Fred felt his left arm grow numb, and then a sensation like that of hot
water running down the limb.Before the soldier could fire the second
time, a ball from Fred's pistol crashed through his brain, and he fell,
an inert mass, in the road.Of the two Confederates overthrown in the wild charge of Ferror, one was
dead, the other was untouched by bullets, but lay groaning with a
broken leg and arm.He lay partly
under his horse, his eyes closed, his bosom stained with blood.[Illustration: Fred raised his Head, "Ferror!"It's all right, Fred--all right,"
he gasped."That was no murder--that was a fair fight, wasn't it?""It is better as it is, Fred.He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was with a far-away
look."Yes, mother," he whispered, and then
his eyes closed forever.The clatter of horses' hoofs, and the clang of sabers were now heard.Fred looked up; a party of Federal cavalry was bearing down upon him.They looked on the bloody scene in astonishment.A dashing young captain
rode up.Fred pointed to young Ferror's lifeless body, and said: "Bring
his body back to Piketon with you.I am one of
General Nelson's scouts."Then everything grew black before him, and he knew no more.He had
fainted from the loss of blood.The rough troopers bound up his arm, staunched the flow of blood, and
soon Fred was able to ride to Piketon.General Nelson received him with
astonishment; yet he would not let him talk, but at once ordered him to
the hospital.As for Robert Ferror, he was given a soldier's burial.A year after the war closed, Frederic Shackelford, a stalwart young man,
sought out the home of Mrs.He found a gray-haired,
brokenhearted mother and two lovely young ladies, her daughters.They
had mourned the son and brother, not only as dead, but as forever
disgraced, for they had been told that Robert had been shot for
desertion.Fred gave them the little mementoes he had kept through the years for
them.He told them how Robert had given his life to try and save him,
and that the last word that trembled on his lips was "Mother."The gray-haired mother lifted her trembling hands, and thanked God that
her son had at least died the death of a soldier.Learning that the family had been impoverished by the war, when Fred
left, he slipped $1,000 in Mrs.Ferror's hand, and whispered, "For
Robert's sake;" and the stricken mother, through tear-dimmed eyes,
watched his retreating form, and murmured: "And Robert would have been
just such a man if he had lived."CRAZY BILL SHERMAN.The ball had gone through the
fleshy part of the arm, causing a great loss of blood; but no bones were
broken, and it was only a question of a few weeks before he would be as
well as ever.The story of the two boys charging four Confederate cavalrymen, killing
three, and disabling the fourth was the wonder of the army.But Fred
modestly disclaimed any particular bravery in the affair."It is to poor Bob Ferror that the honor should be given," he would say;
"the boy that knowingly rode to his death that I might be saved."Fred gave General Nelson the particulars of his capture and escape, and
the general looked grave and said:

"If I had known I was going to place you in such extreme danger, I
should not have sent for you.On account of the crime of young Ferror,
you would have met with a most ignominious death if you had been
recaptured; yet the charging on those four cavalrymen was one of the
pluckiest things I have heard of during the war.You deserve and shall
have a good rest.I have just finished making up some dispatches for
General Sherman, and you shall be my messenger.A dispatch boat leaves
in the morning, and you shall go with it.When you get to Catlettsburg,
you can take an Ohio river steamer for Louisville.The trip being all by
water, will be an easy one, and as a number of sick and wounded will be
sent away on the same boat, you will have good surgical attendance for
your wounded arm.Here is a paper that will admit you to the officers'
hospital when you get to Louisville.I do
not think it will be long before I, with my command, will be ordered
back to Louisville.The enemy has retreated through Pound Gap into
Virginia, and there is nothing more for me to do here.Stay in
Louisville until you hear from me."The next morning found Fred on his way down the Big Sandy.The whole
voyage was uneventful, and after a quick trip Fred once more found
himself in Louisville.The rest and quiet of the voyage had almost cured
the ill-effects of his experience, and with the exception of his wounded
arm, which he was compelled to carry in a sling, he was feeling about as
well as ever.Once in Louisville, he lost no time in turning over his dispatches to
General Sherman.He found the general surrounded by a delegation of the
prominent Union men of the city.They seemed to be arguing with Sherman
about something, and as for the general, he was in a towering rage, and
was swearing in a manner equal to General Nelson in one of his outbreaks
of anger.Fred was surprised to find the usually mild and gentlemanly officer in
such a passion, but there was no mistake, he was angry clear through."There is no use talking, gentlemen," he was saying, as he paced the
room with quick nervous tread, "I am not only going to resign, but I
have already sent in my resignation.I will not remain in command of the
Department of Kentucky another day; the command of the armies of the
United States would not induce me to remain and be insulted and outraged
as I have been.""We are very sorry to hear it, General," replied the spokesman of the
delegation."We had great hopes of what you would accomplish when you
were appointed to the command of the department, and our confidence in
you is still unabated.""I am thankful," replied the general, "for that confidence, but what can
you expect of a man bound hand and foot.They seem to know a great deal
better in Washington what we need here than we do who are on the ground.This, in a measure, is to be expected; but to be reviled and insulted is
more than I can stand.But if I had not resigned, I should be removed, I
know that.Just let the newspapers begin howling at a general, and
denouncing him, and every official at Washington begins shaking in his
boots.What can be expected of a general with every newspaper in the
land yelping at his heels like a pack of curs?If I wanted to end this
war quickly, I would begin by hanging every editor who would publish a
word on how the war should be conducted."Are you not a little too severe on the newspaper fraternity, General?"mildly put in one of the citizen delegates.They think
they know more about war, and how to conduct campaigns than all the
military men of the country combined.Not satisfied with telling me how
and when to conduct a campaign, they attack me most unjustly and
cruelly, attack me in such a manner I cannot reply.Just listen to
this," and the general turned and took up a scrapbook in which numerous
newspaper clippings had been pasted."Here is an editorial from that
esteemed and influential paper, _The Cincinnati Commerce_," and the
general read:

"'It is a lamentable fact that many of our generals are grossly
incompetent, but when incipient insanity is added to incompetency, it is
time to cry a halt.Right here at home, the general who commands the
Department of Kentucky and therefore has the safety of our city in his
hands, is W. T. Sherman.We have it on the most reliable evidence that
he is of unsound mind.Not only do many of his sayings excite the pity
of his friends and ridicule of his enemies, but they are positively
dangerous to the success of our cause.The Government should at least
put the department in charge of a general of sound mind.'"Now, if that is not enough," continued the general, with a touch of
irony in his tones, "I will give you a choice clipping from the great
_New York Tricate_."'It is with sorrow that we learn that General W. T. Sherman, who is in
command of the Department of Kentucky, is not in his right mind.It is
said that the authorities at Washington have been aware of this for some
time, but for political reasons fear to remove him.He is a brother of
John Sherman, one of the influential politicians of Ohio, and United
States Senator-elect.While the affair is to be regretted, the
Government should not hesitate on account of political influence.That he is mentally unsound
is admitted, even by his best friends.The whole company was smiling at the absurdity of the affair."I will read once more," said the general."It is from the _Chicago
Timer_, and hits others as well as myself.Here it is:

"'General Bill Sherman, in command of the Department of Kentucky, is
said to be insane.In our mind the whole Lincoln
Government, from President down, is insane--insane over the idea that
they can coerce the South back into the Union.The only difference that
we can see is that Bill Sherman may be a little crazier than the rest;
that's all.'"There," continued the general, "are only a few of the scores of
extracts which I have from the most influential papers in the land.Of
course the smaller papers have taken their cue from the larger ones, and
now the whole pack of little whiffets are after me, snapping at my
heels; and the good people believe the story because it is published.Hundreds of letters are being received at Washington, asking for my
removal.My brother writes that he is overwhelmed with inquiries
concerning me.I believe the War Department more than half believes I am
of unsound mind.They are only waiting for an excuse to get rid of me,
and I know that my resignation will be received with joy.""General," asked one of the citizens present, "have you any idea of how
the story of your insanity started?""When Secretary of War Cameron was here,
I laid before him the wants of Kentucky, and among other things said
that I needed 60,000 men for defensive work, but for offensive
operations I should need 200,000.The Secretary spoke of it as an
'insane request.'Some reporter got hold of it, and then it went.The
Secretary has never taken the pains to correct the impressions.""Were you not a little extravagant in your demands?"The politicians at Washington have never yet recognized
the magnitude of the war in which we are engaged.Then their whole life
is office, and they are afraid of doing something that will lose them a
vote.As for the newspapers, they would rather print a sensation than
have us win a victory.They have called me crazy so much they
have alarmed my wife," and the general again indulged in another burst
of anger.When he became calmer, he said: "Gentlemen, I thank you for
your expressions of sympathy and confidence.I trust my successor will
be more worthy than I," and he bowed the delegation out.The general noticed him, and asked: "Well, my
boy, what is it?Why, bless my soul, it's Fred Shackelford!"Yes, General, with dispatches," and he handed them to him."I will read them when I cool off a little; I have been rather warm.I
see your arm is in a sling; been in a skirmish?"The wound didn't amount to much; it is
nearly well.""You should be thankful it is no worse.Come in in the morning, Fred; I
will have the dispatches read by that time."Fred called, as requested, the next morning, and found the general calm
and courteous as ever."General Nelson writes good news," said Sherman."He reports he has
entirely driven the Rebels out of the valley of the Big Sandy.He also
tells me in a private letter of your capture and escape.He speaks of
the desperate conflict that you and your comrade had with four Rebel
cavalrymen.My boy, I shall keep my
eye on you.I surely should ask for your services myself if I were going
to remain in command of the department.""General, I am sorry to have you resign," answered Fred, hardly knowing
what to say.The general's face darkened, and then he answered lightly: "I do not
think they will be sorry at Washington."And they were not; his resignation was gladly accepted, and the general
who afterward led his victorious army to Atlanta, and then made his
famous march to the sea, and whose fame filled the world, retired under
a cloud.And the injustice of it rankled in his breast and imbittered
his heart for months.The general appointed to succeed Sherman was Don Carlos Buell, a
thorough soldier, and, like McClellan, a splendid organizer; but, like
that general, he was unsuccessful in the field, and during what is known
as the "Bragg-Buell campaign" in Kentucky in the fall of 1862, he
entirely lost the confidence of his soldiers.Buell's first attention was given to the organization of his army and
the drilling of his soldiers.His labors in this direction were very
successful, and the "Army of the Cumberland" became famous for its
_esprit de corps_.General Nelson, according to his predictions, was ordered back with his
command to Louisville.Fred, now entirely well, was greatly rejoiced to
once more see his old commander.But there was little prospect of active
service, for the division was ordered into camp for the purpose of
drilling and being perfected in military duties.Idleness was irksome to
Fred, so he asked and obtained permission to join General Thomas, and
remain until such time as Nelson might need his services.General Thomas gave Fred a most cordial reception.There was something
about the handsome, dashing boy that greatly endeared him to the staid,
quiet general.Just now, Fred's presence was very desirable, for
Zollicoffer was proving very troublesome, threatening first one point
and then another, and it was almost impossible to tell which place was
in the most danger.General Thomas' forces were greatly scattered,
guarding different points, and he feared that at some of these places
his troops might be attacked and overpowered.He had asked permission of
Buell time and again to be allowed to concentrate his forces and strike
Zollicoffer a telling blow, but each and every time had met with a
refusal.Instead of being allowed to concentrate his force, he was
ordered to move portions of his command here and there, and the orders
of one day might be countermanded the next.Being December, the roads
were in a horrible condition, and it was almost impossible to move
trains, so that his army was being reduced by hard service which did no
good.He would sit for
hours buried in thought or poring over maps.All this time, Zollicoffer was ravaging the middle southern counties of
Kentucky, threatening first London, then Somerset, then Columbia, then
some intermediate point.The outposts of the army were often attacked,
and frequent skirmishes took place.In the midst of this activity, Fred
found congenial employment.He was kept busy carrying dispatches from
one post to another, or on scouting expeditions, trying to gain
information of the movements of the enemy.He frequently met squads of
the enemy, and had many narrow escapes from capture; but the fleetness
of his horse always saved him.Of all General Thomas' scouts, Fred obtained the most valuable
information.While not venturing into the enemy's lines, he had a way of
getting information out of the inhabitants friendly to the South that
surprised even the general.Fred hardly ever made a mistake as to the
movements of the opposing army.If there was one thing that he loved more than another it was his horse.He had trained him to do anything that a horse could do.At a word he
would lie down and remain as motionless as if dead.He would go anywhere
he was told without hesitating, and his keen ear would detect the
presence of an enemy quicker than the ear of his master.Fred had also
perfected himself in the use of a revolver until he was one of the best
shots in the army.He could ride by a tree at full gallop, and put three
balls in a three-inch circle without checking his speed."My life," he would say, "may depend on my being able to shoot quickly
and accurately."On some of his scouts Fred would take a party with him, and there was
not a soldier who did not consider it one of the greatest honors to be
thus chosen.One day near the close of the year Fred was scouting with a picked
force of five men a few miles to the east and south of Somerset.As they
were riding through a piece of wood, Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up
his ears, listened a moment, and then turned and looked at his master,
as if to say, "Danger ahead!""To cover, boys," said Fred, in a low tone.The party turned aside into the wood, and was soon completely hidden
from view."Steady now," said Fred; "no noise.""Are you sure your horse is as wise as you think?""Perfectly sure; Prince never makes a mistake.The trampling of horses, and the jingling of sabers could plainly be
heard, and soon a party of nine Confederate cavalrymen came riding by.They had no thought of danger, and were laughing and talking, thinking
not that death lurked so near them."The old traitor lives right ahead," they heard one say."We will learn him to harbor East Tennessee bridge-burners," said the
leader with a coarse laugh."Will it be hanging or shooting, Sergeant?"It's such fun to see a Lincolnite hanging by the neck
and dancing on air.Never shoot a man if you can hang him, is my motto."Fred's men heard this conversation with lowering brows, and the
muttered curses were deep if not loud, and five carbines were raised,
but with a gesture Fred motioned them down.His men looked at him in
astonishment, and there was disappointment on every face.As soon as the Confederates were out of hearing, so it was safe to
speak, one of the men said with a sigh:

"Capt'in,"--the soldiers always called Fred captain when they were out
with him--"I would hev give five dollars for a shot.I would hev fetched
that feller that loved to see hangin', sure.""I have strict orders," replied Fred, "to avoid fighting when I am out
on these scouting expeditions.It is the part of a good scout never to
get into a fight except to avoid capture.A scout is sent out to get
information, not to fight; a conflict defeats the very object he has in
view.""That's so, capt'in, but it goes agin the grain to let them fellers
off.""I may have made a mistake," replied Fred, "in letting those fellows
off.Come to think about it, I do not like what they said."Worse than that, capt'in.""We will follow them up," said Fred, "as far as we can unobserved.You
remember we passed a pretty farmhouse some half a mile back; that may be
the place they were talking about.We can ride within three hundred
yards of it under cover of the forest."Riding carefully through the wood, they soon came in sight of the
place.Surely enough, the Confederates had stopped in front of the
house.Four of them were holding the horses, while the other five were
not to be seen.As they sat looking the muffled sound of two shots were
heard, and then the shrieking of women."Boys," said Fred, in a strained voice, "I made a mistake in not letting
you shoot.There are
nine of them; we are six.shouted every one, their eyes blazing with excitement."Then for God's sake, forward, or we will be too late!"for the frenzied
shrieks of women could still be heard.They no sooner broke cover, than the men holding the horses discovered
them, and gave the alarm.The five miscreants who were in the house came
rushing out, and all hastily mounting their horses, rode swiftly away.The Federals, with yells of vengeance, followed in swift pursuit; yet in
all probability the Confederates would have escaped if it had not been
for the fleetness of Prince.Fred soon distanced all of his companions,
and so was comparatively alone and close on the heels of the enemy.They noticed this, and conceived the idea that they could kill or
capture him.Fred was watching for this very
thing, and as they stopped he fired, just as the leader's horse was
broadside to him.Then at the word, Prince turned as quick as a flash,
and was running back.The movement was so unexpected to the Confederates
that the volley they fired went wild.As for the horse of the Confederate leader, it reared and plunged, and
then fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground.Two of his men
dismounted to help him.When he got to his feet, he saw that Fred's
companions had joined him and that they all were coming on a charge.Now, boys, stand firm; there are only six of them.But it takes men of iron nerve to stand still and receive a charge, and
the Federals were coming like a whirlwind.The Confederates emptied their revolvers at close range, and then half
of them turned to flee.It was too late; the Federals were among them,
shooting, sabering, riding them down.When it was over, eight Confederates lay dead or desperately wounded.Of
the six Federals, two were dead and two were wounded.Only one
Confederate had escaped to carry back the story of the disaster.[Illustration: The Federals were among them, shooting, sabering, riding
them down.]One of the wounded Confederates lay groaning and crying with pain, and
Fred going up to him, asked if he could do anything for him.The man looked up, and then a scowl of hate came over his face.he groaned, and then with an oath said: "I will have
you if I die for it," and attempted to raise his revolver, which he
still clutched.As quick as a flash Fred knocked it out of his hand, and as quick one of
Fred's men had a revolver at the breast of the desperate Confederate.Fred knocked the weapon up, and the shot passed harmlessly over the head
of the wounded man."None of that, Williams," said Fred."We cannot afford to kill wounded
men in cold blood.""But the wretch would have murdered you, capt'in," said Williams, and
then a cry went up from all the men.Fred looked at the man closely, and then said: "You are Bill Pearson,
the man I struck with my riding-whip at Gallatin.""You miserable wretch," said Fred, contemptuously."By good rights I
ought to blow your brains out, but your carcass is not worth the powder.Just then Fred noticed a countryman who had been attracted by the sound
of the firing, and motioned to him to approach.He came up trembling,
and looked with wonder on the dead men and horses."My good man," said Fred, "here are some wounded men that should be
looked after.Can you not do it, or get word to their command?""I reckon I kin," slowly replied the countryman."Yes," replied Fred; "and this reminds me, boys, we had better get away
from here.We do not know how many of the enemy may be near."The wounds of the two Federals who had been hurt were bound up, and they
were helped on their horses.The bodies of the two dead were then
tenderly placed on two of the Confederate horses which were unhurt, and
the mournful cavalcade slowly moved away.Going back to the house which the Confederates had entered, a
distressing sight met their view.On a bed, the master of the house lay dead, shot to death by the
murderers.By the bedside stood the wife and two daughters, weeping and
wringing their hands.The face of the widow was covered with blood, and
there was a deep gash on her head where one of the wretches had struck
her with the butt of his revolver, as she clung to him imploring him not
to murder her husband.The pitiful sight drove Fred's men wild, and he had all that he could do
to prevent them from going back and finishing the wounded murderers."You did wrong, capt'in, in not letting me finish that red-handed
villain who tried to shoot you," said Williams.With broken sobs the woman told her story.Her husband had a brother in
East Tennessee, who had been accused by the Confederate authorities of
helping burn railroad bridges.He escaped with a number of Union men,
and was now a captain in one of the Tennessee regiments."They came here," said the woman, "and found my husband sick in bed, so
sick he could not raise a finger to help himself.They accused him of
harboring his brother, and of furnishing information, and said that they
had come to hang him, but as he was sick they would shoot him.And
then," sobbed the woman, "notwithstanding our prayers, they shot him
before our eyes.and the stricken wife broke
completely down, and the daughters hung over the body of their murdered
father, weeping as if their hearts would break.He told the sobbing women that he would at once
report the case, and have her husband's brother come out with his
company."We will also," said Fred, "leave the bodies of our two dead
comrades here.If you wish, I will send a chaplain, that all may have
Christian burial.And, my poor woman, your wrongs have been fearfully
avenged.Of the nine men in the party that murdered your husband, but
one escaped.said the women, raising their streaming eyes to
heaven.Even the presence of death did not take away their desire for
revenge.Such is poor human nature, even in gentle woman."War makes demons of us all," thought Fred.The story of that fight was long a theme around the camp fire, and the
three soldiers who survived never tired of telling it.As for Fred, he
spoke of it with reluctance, and could not think of it without a
shudder.Fifteen men never engaged in a bloodier conflict, even on the
"dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky.THE MEETING OF THE COUSINS.General Thomas sat in his headquarters at Lebanon looking over some
dispatches which Fred had just brought from General Schoepf at Somerset.His face wore a look of anxiety as he read, for the dispatches told him
that General Zollicoffer had crossed to the north side of the Cumberland
river and was fortifying his camp at Beech Grove."I may be attacked at any moment," wrote General Schoepf, "and you know
how small my force is.For the love of heaven, send me reinforcements."The general sat with his head bowed in his hands thinking of what could
be done, when an orderly entered with dispatches from Louisville.Thomas
opened them languidly, for he expected nothing but the old story of
keeping still and doing nothing.Suddenly his face lighted up; his whole
countenance beamed with satisfaction, and turning to Fred he said:

"My boy, here is news for us, indeed.General Buell has at last
consented to advance.He has given orders for me to concentrate my army
and attack Zollicoffer at the earliest possible moment.""General," he exclaimed, "I already see Zollicoffer defeated, and hurled
back across the Cumberland.""Don't be too sanguine, Fred," he said; "none of
us know what the fortune of war may be; we can only hope for the best.But this means more work for you, my boy.You will at once have to
return with dispatches to General Schoepf.Somerset must be held at all hazards.""I am ready to start this minute with such tidings," gayly responded
Fred."Prince, poor fellow, will have it the hardest, for the roads are
awful.""That is what I am afraid of," replied the general."I hope to be with
Schoepf within a week, but, owing to the condition of the roads, it may
take me much longer."Within an hour Fred was on his way back to Somerset.It was a terrible
journey over almost impassable roads; streams, icy cold, had to be
forded; but boy and horse were equal to the occasion, and in three days
reached Somerset.He
commenced his march from Lebanon on December 31st; it was January 18th
before he reached his destination.The
rain poured in torrents, and small streams were turned into raging
rivers.Bridges were swept away, and had to be rebuilt.The soldiers,
benumbed with chilling rain, toiled on over the sodden roads, cheerful
in the thought that they were soon to meet the enemies of their country.General Schoepf received the news of General Thomas' advance with great
satisfaction."If I can only hold on," he said, "until Thomas comes, everything will
be all right.""We must show a bold front, General," replied Fred, "and make the enemy
believe we have a large force.""It's the enemy that is showing a bold front nowadays," replied General
Schoepf, with a faint smile."They have been particularly saucy lately.They have in the last few days, cut off two or three small scouting
parties.But what worries me the most is that there is hardly a night
but that every man on some one of our picket posts is missing.There is
no firing, not the least alarm of any kind, but the men in the morning
are gone.It is a mystery we have tried to solve in vain.At first we
thought the men had deserted, but we have given that idea up.The men
are getting superstitious over the disappearance of so many of their
comrades, and are actually becoming demoralized.""General, will you turn this picket business over to me?""I have heard much of your ability in
ferreting out secret matters.Your success as a scout I am well
acquainted with, as you know.I hope you will serve me as well in this
matter of the pickets, for I am at my wits' end.""Well, General, to-morrow I will be at your service, and I trust you
will lose no more pickets before that time," and so saying Fred took his
leave, for he needed rest badly.The next morning, when Fred went to pay his respects to the general, he
found him with a very long face."Another post of four men disappeared
last night," he said."Well, General, if possible, I will try and
solve the problem, but it may be too hard for me.""Have you any idea yet how they are captured?"I must first look over the ground carefully, see how the
men are posted, talk with them, and then I may be able to form an idea."Fred's first business was to ride out to where the post had been
captured during the night.This he did, noting the lay of the ground,
carefully looking for footprints not only in front, but in the rear of
where the men had been stationed.He then visited all the picket posts,
talked with the men, learned their habits on picket, whether they were
as watchful as they should be--in fact, not the slightest thing of
importance escaped his notice.On his return from his tour of inspection, Fred said to General
Schoepf, "Well, General, I have my idea.""Your pickets have been captured from the rear, not the front.""I mean that some of the pickets are so placed that a wary foe could
creep in between the posts and come up in the rear, completely
surprising the men.I think I found evidence that the men captured last
night were taken in that way.I found, at least, six posts of which I
believe an enemy could get in the rear without detection, especially if
the land had been spied out.""You astonish me," said the general."But even if this is so, why does
not the sentinel give the alarm?""He may be in such a position that he dare not," answered Fred."That a double force be put on the posts, half to watch the rear.It
will be my business to-night to see to that.""Very well," replied General Schoepf."I shall be very curious to see
how the plan works, and whether your idea is the correct one or not.""I will not warrant it, General," replied Fred, "but there will be no
harm in trying."Just before night Fred made a second round of the picket posts, and
made careful inquiry whether any one of the posts had been visited
during the day by any one from the outside.All of the posts answered in the negative save one.The corporal of that
post said: "Why, a country boy was here to sell us some vegetables and
eggs.""Was he a bright boy, and did he seem to notice
things closely?"Daniel travelled to the bathroom."On the contrary," said the corporal, "he appeared to be remarkably dull
and ignorant.""Has the same boy been in the habit of selling vegetables to the
pickets?"Come to think about it, the corporal believed he had heard such a boy
spoken of.Then one of the men spoke up and said:

"You know Rankin was on the post that was taken in last night.He had a
letter come yesterday, and I took it out to him, and he told me of what
a fine supper they were going to have, saying they had bought some eggs
and a chicken of a boy."suddenly exclaimed the corporal, "that boy to-day walked to
the rear some little distance--made an excuse for going; he might not
have been such a fool as he looked.""Corporal, I will be here a little after dark
with a squad of men to help you keep watch.In the mean time keep a
sharp lookout.""That I will," answered the corporal."Do you think that boy was a
spy?"But if any
trouble occurs on the picket line to-night, it will be at this post."That night Fred doubled the pickets on six posts which he considered the
most exposed.But the extra men were to guard the rear instead of the
front.The most explicit instructions were given, and they were
cautioned that they were to let no alarm at the front make them relax
their vigilance in the rear.Thirty yards in the rear of the post where
he was to watch Fred had noticed a small ravine which led down into a
wood.It was through this ravine that he concluded the enemy would creep
if they should try to gain the rear of the post.Fred posted his men so
as to watch this ravine.To the corporal who had charge of the post, he
said:

"My theory is, that some one comes up to your sentinel, and attracts his
attention by pretending to be a friend, or perhaps a deserter.This, of
course, will necessitate the sentinel's calling for you, and naturally
attract the attention of every man awake.While this is going on, a
party that has gained the rear unobserved will rush on you and be in
your midst before you know it, and you will be taken without a single
gun being fired."said one, "I believe it could be done.""Now," continued Fred, "if you are hailed from the front to-night act
just as if you had not heard of this.When everything was prepared the soldiers, wrapped in their blankets,
sat down to wait for what might come.So intently did they listen that
the falling of a leaf would startle them.There was a half-moon, but dark clouds swept across the sky, and only
now and then she looked forth, hiding her face again in a moment.Once
in a while a dash of cold rain would cause the sentinels to shiver and
sink their chins deeper into the collars of their great coats.Midnight came, and still all was quiet.The soldiers not on guard lay
wrapped in their blankets, some of them in the land of dreams.Off in the woods the hoot of an owl was heard.A few minutes passed, and again the dismal "Whoo!Instantly they were all
attention, and every sense alert.whispered the sergeant, next to him."Nothing but the suspicious hooting of an owl," whispered back Fred.Then to the soldiers, "Perfectly still, men; not a sound."So still were they that the beatings of their hearts could be heard.Again the dismal hoot was heard, this time so near that it startled
them.Then from the sentinel out in front came the short, sharp challenge,
"Who comes there?""A deserter who wishes to come into the
lines and give himself up."The corporal went forward to receive the deserter.Now there came the
sound of swiftly advancing footsteps in front of the rear post, and dim
figures were seen through the darkness.Seven rifles belched forth their contents, and for a moment the flashes
of the guns lighted up the scene, and then all was dark.There were cries of pain, hoarse yells of surprise and anger, and then a
scattering volley returned."Use your revolvers," shouted Fred, and a rapid fire was opened.There were a few more
scattering shots, and all was still.The deserter, who was so anxious to give himself up, the moment the
alarm was given fired at the sentinel and vanished in the darkness.The sound of the firing created the wildest commotion in camp.The long
roll was beaten; the half-dressed, frightened soldiers came rolling out
of their tents, some without their guns, others without their cartridge
boxes; excited officers in their night clothes ran through the camp,
waving their bare swords and shouting: "Fall in, men, for God's sake,
fall in."It was some minutes before the excitement abated, and every one was
asking, "What is it?The officer of the day, with a strong escort, came riding out to where
the firing was heard.Being challenged, he gave the countersign, and
then hurriedly asked what occasioned the firing."Oh," cheerfully responded Fred, "they tried to take us in, and got
taken in themselves."An examination of the ground in front of where Fred's squad was
stationed revealed two Confederates still in death, and trails of blood
showed that others had been wounded."You can go to your quarters," said Fred to his men."You will not be
needed again to-night; and, Lieutenant," said he, turning to the officer
of the day, "each and every one of these men deserves thanks for his
steadiness and bravery.""I hardly think, General," said Fred, the next morning, as he made his
report, "that your pickets will be disturbed any more."As for General Schoepf, he was delighted, and could not thank Fred
enough.For three or four days things were comparatively quiet.Then a small
scouting party was attacked and two men captured.The next day a larger
party was attacked and driven in, with a loss of one killed and three
wounded.The stories were the same; the leader of the Confederates was a
young lieutenant, who showed the utmost bravery and handled his men with
consummate skill."I wish," said General Schoepf to Fred, "that you would teach this
young lieutenant the same kind of a lesson that you taught those fellows
who were capturing our pickets.""I can try, General, but I am afraid the job will not only be harder,
but much more dangerous than that one," answered Fred."This same young lieutenant," continued the general, "may have had a
hand in that picket business, and since he received his lesson there has
turned his attention to scouting parties.""In that case," replied Fred, "it will take the second lesson to teach
him good manners.Well, General, I will give it to him, if I can."The next morning, with eight picked men from Wolford's cavalry, Fred
started out in search of adventure."Don't be alarmed, General," said Fred, as he rode away, "if we do not
come back to-night.Many of their comrades, with longing eyes, looked after them, and wished
they were of the number; yet they did not know but that every one was
riding to death or captivity.Yet such is the love of adventure in the
human breast that the most dangerous undertakings will be gladly risked.After riding west about three miles Fred turned south and went about the
same distance.He then halted, and after a careful survey of the country
ahead, said: "I think, boys, it will be as well for us to leave the road
and take to the woods; we must be getting dangerously near the enemy's
country."The party turned from the road and entered a wood.Working their way
through this, skirting around fields, and dashing across open places,
after making a careful observation of the front, they managed to proceed
about two miles further, when they came near the crossing of two main
roads.Here they stopped and fed their horses, while the men ate their
scanty fare of hard bread and bacon.They had not been there long before a squadron of at least 200
Confederate cavalry came from the south, and turning west were soon out
of sight."I hardly think, boys," said Fred, "it would have paid us to try to take
those fellows into camp; we will let them go this time," and there was a
twinkle in his eye, although he kept his face straight."Just as you say, capt'in," replied one of the troopers, as he took a
chew of tobacco."We would have gobbled them in if you had said the
word."A little while after this a troop of ten horsemen came up the same road,
but instead of turning west they kept on north.At the head of the troop
rode a youthful officer.One of the soldiers with Fred was one of the number that had been
attacked and defeated two days before by the squad of which they were in
search."That's he, that's the fellow!"What he had come for, fate had thrown
in his way."If they were double, we would fight them," cried the men all together."Let them pass out of sight before we pursue," said Fred."The farther
we get them from their lines the better.""Now," said Fred, after they had waited about five minutes.A ride of a
few minutes more brought them into the road.Halting a moment, Fred
turned to his men and said:

"Men, I know every one of you will do your duty.All I have to say is
obey orders, keep cool, and make every shot count.With a cheer they followed their gallant young leader.After riding
about two miles, Fred reined up and said: "They have not dodged us, have
they, boys?We ought to have sighted them before this.Here is where we
turned off of the road.I believe they noticed that a squad
of horsemen had turned off into the woods, and are following the tracks.Let's see," and Fred jumped from his horse, and examined the tracks
leading into the woods."That's what they did, boys," said he, looking up."I will give that
lieutenant credit for having sharp eyes.Now, boys, we will give him a
surprise by following."They did not go more than half a mile before they caught sight of the
Confederates.Evidently they had concluded not to follow the tracks any
farther, for they had turned and were coming back, and the two parties
must have sighted each other at nearly the same moment.There was the sharp crack of a carbine, and a ball whistled over the
Federals' heads.The young lieutenant who led the Confederates was
far too careful a leader to charge an unknown number of men.Instead of
charging the Confederates dismounted, and leaving their horses in charge
of two of their number the rest deployed and advanced, dodging from tree
to tree, and the bullets began to whistle uncomfortably close, one horse
being hit."Dismount, and take the horses back," was Fred's order."We must meet
them with their own game."The two men who were detailed to take the
horses back went away grumbling because they were not allowed to stay in
the fight.Telling them to keep well covered, Fred advanced his men slightly, and
soon the carbines were cracking at a lively rate.But the fight was more noisy than dangerous, every man being careful to
keep a tree between himself and his foe."This can be kept up all day," muttered Fred, "and only trees and
ammunition will suffer.Orders were given to fall back to the horses, and the men obeyed
sullenly.A word from Fred, and their faces brightened.Mounting their
horses, they rode back as if in disorderly retreat.As soon as the Confederates discovered the movement, they rushed back
for their horses, mounted, and with wild hurrahs started in swift
pursuit of what they thought was a demoralized and retreating foe.Coming to favorable ground, Fred ordered his men to wheel and charge.So
sudden was the movement that the Confederates faltered, then halted.cried their young leader, spurring his horse on, but at that
moment a chance shot cut one of his bridle reins.The horse became
unmanageable, and running under the overhanging branches of a tree, the
gallant lieutenant was hurled to the ground.His men, dismayed by his
fall, and unable to withstand the impetuous onslaught of the Federals,
beat a precipitate retreat, leaving their commander and two of their
number prisoners in the hands of their foes.Two more of their men were
grievously wounded.Three of the Federals had been wounded in the mêlée.Fred dismounted and bent over the young lieutenant, and then started
back uttering an exclamation of surprise and grief.He had looked into
the face of his cousin, Calhoun Pennington.Hurriedly Fred placed his
hand on the fallen boy's heart.There was no sign of a
wound on his body.He has only been stunned by the fall," exclaimed Fred.In the mean time the five remaining Confederates had halted about a
quarter of a mile away, and were listening to what a sergeant, now in
command, was saying."Boys," he exclaimed, "it will be to our everlasting shame and disgrace
if we run away and leave the lieutenant in the hands of those cursed
Yankees.Some of them must be disabled, as well as some of us.Let us
charge and retake the lieutenant, or die to a man in the attempt.""Here is our hand on that, Sergeant," said each one of the four, and one
after the other placed his hand in that of the grim old sergeant.But just as they were about to start on their desperate attempt, they
were surprised to see Fred riding towards them, waving a white
handkerchief.When he came in hailing distance, he cried:

"Men, your gallant young leader lies over here grievously hurt.We are
going to withdraw," and wheeling his horse, he rode swiftly back.One of his men was so badly
wounded that he had to be supported on his horse; therefore their
progress was slow, and it was night before they reached camp.Fred made
his report to General Schoepf and turned over his two prisoners.The
general was well pleased, and extended to Fred and the soldiers with him
his warmest congratulations."If you had only brought in that daring young lieutenant with you your
victory would have been complete," said the general."I hardly think, General," said Fred, "that you will be troubled with
him any more.He was still insensible when we left, and with my three
wounded men and the two prisoners it was well-nigh an impossibility for
us to bring him in.""I know," replied the General, "and as you say, I think we have had the
last of him.""I sincerely hope so," was Fred's answer as he turned away, and it meant
more than the general thought.Fred had a horror of meeting his cousin
in conflict, and devoutly prayed he might never do so again.Every time he closed his eyes he could see the pale
face of his cousin lying there in the wood, and the thought that he
might be dangerously hurt, perhaps dead, filled him with terror."Why,"
he asked himself over and over again, "did the fortune of war bring us
together?"Let us return to the scene of the conflict, and see how Calhoun is
getting along.The Confederates received Fred's message with surprise."That lets us out of a mighty tough scrape," remarked the sergeant."We
must have hurt them worse than we thought.""Don't know about that," answered one of his men who was watching the
Federals as they retired."There is only one of them who appears to be
badly hurt; and they have poor Moon and Hunt in limbo, sure.""Better be prisoners than dead," answered the sergeant."But, boys, let
us to the lieutenant.It's strange the Yanks didn't try to take him
back."When they reached Calhoun, he was already showing signs of returning
consciousness, and in a few minutes he was able to sit up and converse."Then we whipped them after all," and his face lighted up with joy."Can't say that we did, Lieutenant," answered the sergeant; "but they
left mighty sudden for some reason."Calhoun looked around on his men with a troubled countenance."I see
only five of you," he said; "where are the rest?""Two are back nursing wounds," answered the sergeant."Sheldon is hit,
so hard hit I am afraid he is done for.As for Moon and Hunt, they have
gone off with the Yanks."The tears rolled down the cheeks of the young officer."Boys," he said,
chokingly, "I believe I have lost my grip.There was that last picket
affair that went against us, and now we are all broken up in a fair
combat.""Don't take on, Lieutenant," said the sergeant, soothingly."It was that
chance bullet that cut your bridle rein that did the business.If it
hadn't been for that we would have wiped them out, sure.As it is, we
are thankful they didn't take a notion to lug you off.""No, they didn't," replied the sergeant, and then he told Calhoun what
had happened."What kind of a looking man was the leader of the Yanks?""He was a boy, no older than yourself.He was mounted on a magnificent
bay horse with a star in the forehead.Mary went to the hallway."I see it all," sighed Calhoun."The leader of that party was my cousin,
Fred Shackelford.Boys, help me on my
horse.I am badly shaken up, but not seriously hurt.We will square
accounts with those fellows one of these days."And the little party, bearing their wounded, sadly wended their way back
to the Confederate camp.For the next few days the weather was so bad and the roads in such a
terrible condition that both armies were comparatively quiet.Nothing as
yet had been heard from the advance of General Thomas, and General
Schoepf began to be very uneasy.At last Fred offered to ride toward
Columbia, and see if he could not get some tidings of the missing
column.The offer was gladly accepted, and Fred set out.He met with no
adventure until about fifteen miles from Somerset, when he suddenly came
face to face with a young soldier, and he supposed a Federal, as he wore
a blue great coat.But a second look caused a cry of surprise to burst
from Fred's lips, and at the same time the supposed Federal soldier
snatched a revolver from the holster.The cousins were once more face to
face."Put up your revolver, Calhoun," cried Fred."Is that the way you greet
your cousin?"For a moment Calhoun gazed on Fred in silence, then raising his hand in
courtly salute, he suddenly turned his horse, and jumping him over a low
fence, disappeared in a copse of wood.Fred was on the point of raising his voice to call him back, when it
flashed upon him that Calhoun had been playing the spy, and that he dare
not stop, even for a moment."He was only stunned after all, when he was hurled from his horse,"
thought Fred."I am so glad; a heavy load has been lifted from my mind.It would have been extremely awkward for
me to have found out he was a spy, and then let him go."It was with a lighter heart that he pursued his journey, but he had gone
but a short distance when he met a courier from General Thomas with
dispatches for General Schoepf.He was informed that the advance of
General Thomas was but a short distance in the rear.A few moments more
and Fred was in the presence of his general.said Thomas, "I am glad to see you."All right, General, only General Schoepf has been sorely worried over
your non-appearance."The march has been an awful one, and has taken three
times as long as I expected.But we will be at Logan's Cross Roads
to-night, where I shall halt to concentrate my army.If the enemy does
not retreat, we may look for a lively time in about three days.""The lively time, General, may come before three days," answered Fred,
significantly."The Rebels may conclude," answered Fred, "to attack you before you can
bring up the rest of your force, or get aid from Somerset.Fishing Creek
is very high; I had to swim it.It will be almost impossible to get
infantry or artillery over.""I have thought of that," replied the general, smiling."I shall try and
be ready for them if they come."Fred was right in his surmise that Calhoun had been acting the part of a
spy.He had been playing a very dangerous game, and had been successful.Disguised as a country boy, he had boldly entered Columbia, and in a
great measure had fathomed the plans of General Thomas.It was a matter
of common report that as soon as the army could be concentrated, General
Zollicoffer would be attacked.Calhoun had made a careful estimate of
the strength of Thomas' army, and when met by Fred he was taking an
observation of his order of march, and how long it would take the rear
brigade to reinforce the advance brigade, if it should be attacked.The sudden meeting with Fred was a surprise to him.But when he heard
Fred's voice he knew his life was in no danger; yet he dare not tarry,
even for a moment, and so escaped as we have seen.No sooner was he out of sight of Fred than he checked his horse."That
was a lucky escape," he said to himself."If I had to meet any one, it
was fortunate I met Fred.I would so much like to have a talk with him, but it would have been
madness to have stopped, and then it would have placed him in a very
awkward predicament.Selim, old boy," continued he, patting his horse's
neck, "we have work yet before us; we must see where General Thomas
camps."It was early on the morning of January 18th that Calhoun rode into the
Confederate camp at Beech Grove.Without changing his mud-bespattered
garments, he at once sought the quarters of Major-General G. B.
Crittenden, who had been placed in chief command of the army."Ah, Lieutenant," exclaimed the general, "I am glad to see you.I have
been thinking of you, and blaming myself for permitting you to go on
your hazardous adventure.He who acts as a spy takes his life in his
hands.""It is an old saying that 'all is well that ends well,'" Calhoun
answered, smiling."You ought to have seen what a splendid country
bumpkin I made; and I have succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations.I have very important news for you, General.General
Thomas is now encamped at Logan's Cross Roads, only ten miles away.He
will wait there for his rear brigade, and also for reinforcements from
Somerset.He has only one brigade with him, numbering not much over
4,000 men."Calhoun then went on and gave General Crittenden the full details of the
strength of the Federal army, saying that he thought the rear brigade
of Thomas' army could not reach Logan's Cross Roads for at least two
days, and that owing to the height of water in Fishing Creek he believed
it impossible for Thomas to receive reinforcements from Somerset."If these forces all combine, General," continued Calhoun, "they will so
far outnumber us that it would be madness to risk a battle.To-morrow
Thomas will be isolated; his force is inferior to yours."You think that your information as to numbers and position is
absolutely correct, do you?""I do, General," answered Calhoun."If you attack General Thomas in the
morning I am confident you will attack with a superior force.""It is either that or a disastrous retreat," said the general, gravely."I will call a council of my officers at once."As soon as I can get off some of this mud I will be ready," answered
Calhoun.The council was called, and General Crittenden laid the facts before his
officers.Calhoun was asked a great many questions, to all of which he
gave full and sufficient answers.The council, without a dissenting
voice, voted to attack Thomas the next morning.It was nearly midnight when the Confederates marched out of their
entrenchments, General Zollicoffer's brigade having the advance.Calhoun acted as aid on the staff of General Crittenden.The distance,
ten miles, made a fearful night march, considering the roads.Calhoun
afterwards said that it was one of the worst marches he ever made.A cold drizzling rain fell that chilled the
soldiers to the very bone.Through the rain and the mud for hour after
hour the brave men of the Confederacy toiled on, animated by the hope
that they would soon meet and hurl back in inglorious defeat the men
whom they considered ruthless invaders of their soil.It took nearly
seven hours to march that ten miles, every step being taken through mud
and water, sometimes nearly knee deep.Just as the gray shadows in the east betokened the ushering in of the
short January day, the crack!of guns in front told that the
Federal pickets had been alarmed.The sharp reports of those guns as
they echoed back along the mud-stained ranks caused the weary soldier to
forget his weariness.The cold was no longer felt, the excitement of the
coming battle sent the blood tingling through the veins.It is time to turn now to General Thomas and his little army that lay
encamped at Logan's Cross Roads in the darkness and shadows of that
gloomy night.Couriers had been sent back to hurry up the rear brigade;
orders had been sent to General Schoepf to at once forward three
regiments, but General Thomas well knew if he was attacked in the
morning none of these reinforcements would reach him.The general sat in his tent, listening to Fred giving an account of what
had happened at Somerset during the three weeks he had been there.He
was especially interested in the account Fred gave of his picket fight."That, Shackelford," said the general, "was strategy worthy of a much
older head.Your little fight was also admirably managed.""I had rather it had been against any one than my cousin," answered
Fred."Such things cannot be avoided," answered Thomas, with a sigh.I am a Virginian, and must fight against those who are
near and dear to me."Fred did not answer; he was thinking of his father.The general sat as if buried in deep thought for a moment, and then
suddenly looking up, said:

"Shackelford, you know when we were going into camp this evening that
you said you feared an attack in the morning.""I am almost positive of it, General," was Fred's reply."Because the enemy is well posted and must know that you mean to attack
them when your forces are consolidated, and your army will be so strong
they cannot hope to stand before it.I am also of the opinion that they
are well informed of your isolated position here; that one of your
brigades is two days' march in the rear, also that owing to the high
stage of water in Fishing Creek it will be impossible for General
Schoepf to reinforce you for a day or two.I also believe that the enemy
has a fair estimate of your exact strength."During this speech of Fred's the general listened intently, and then
said: "You have a better idea of my actual position than I trust most of
my officers have, but you said some things which need explaining.On
what grounds do you base your belief that the enemy are so well
acquainted with my situation and strength?""No positive proof, General, but an intuition which I cannot explain.But this impression is also based on more solid ground than intuition.Yesterday, just before I met your advance, I met a man in our uniform.When he saw me he jumped his horse over a fence and disappeared in a
wood.To-day I caught a glimpse of
that same man in the woods yonder on our right."Thomas mused a moment, and then said: "If the Confederate general fully
knows our situation and strength, he is foolish if he does not attack
me.But if he does, I shall try and be ready for him."The general then once more carefully examined his maps of the country,
gave orders that a very strong picket should be posted, and that well in
advance of the infantry pickets cavalry videttes should be placed, and
that the utmost vigilance should be exercised.Then turning to Fred, he said: "If your expectations are realized in the
morning, you may act as one of my aids.And now, gentlemen," said he,
turning to his staff, "for some sleep; we must be astir early in the
morning."In the gray light of the early morning, from away out in front, there
came the faint report of rifles.Early as it was, General Thomas and staff had had their breakfast, and
every soldier was prepared.General Manson, in command of the advance regiments, came galloping back
to headquarters."General," he said, "we are attacked in force.""Go back," replied General Thomas, without betraying any more excitement
than if he were ordering his men out on review, "form your men in the
most advantageous position, and hold the enemy until I can bring up the
rest of the troops."In a trice aids were galloping in every direction.The fitful reports of guns in front had become a steady roll of
musketry.The loud mouth of the cannon joined in, and the heavy
reverberations rolled over field and through forest.In an incredibly
short time every regiment was in motion towards where the heavy smoke of
battle was already hanging over the field.Of all the thousands, the general commanding seemed the most
unconcerned.He leisurely mounted his horse and trotted toward the
conflict.His eye swept the field, and as the regiments came up they
were placed just where they were needed.His manner inspired every one
who saw him with confidence.To Fred the scene was inexpressibly grand.The
wild cheering of men, the steady roll of musketry, the deep bass of
cannon, thrilled him with an excitement never felt before.The singing
of the balls made strange music in his ears.Now and then a shell or
solid shot would crash through the forest and shatter the trees as with
a thunderbolt.Soon a thin line of men came staggering back, some
holding up an arm streaming with blood, others hobbling along using
their guns as crutches.A few, wild with fear, had thrown away their
guns, and were rushing back, lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but an insane desire to get out of that hell of fire.At first there was a lump in the throat, as if
the heart was trying to get away, a slight trembling of the limbs, a
momentary desire to get out of danger, and then he was as cool and
collected as if on parade.Through the storm of balls he rode,
delivering his orders with a smiling face, and a word of cheer.General
Thomas noticed the coolness of his aid, and congratulated him on his
soldierly qualities.On the left, in front of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, the battle was
being waged with obstinate fury.Colonel Fry, seeing Fred, rode up to
him, and said: "Tell General Thomas I must have reinforcements at once;
the enemy is flanking me.""Say to Colonel Fry," said Thomas, "that I will at once forward the aid
required.Until the reinforcements come, tell him to hold his position
at all hazards."Fry compressed his lips, glanced along his
line, saw the point of greatest danger, and quickly ordered two of his
left companies to the right, leading them in person, Fred going with
him.An officer enveloped in a large gray coat suddenly rode out of the wood,
and galloping up to them shouted: "For God's sake, stop firing!You are
firing on your own men."Just then two other officers rode up to the one in a gray cloak.Seeing
Colonel Fry and Fred, they at once fired on them.Colonel Fry was
slightly wounded, but Fred was untouched.As quick as thought both
returned the fire.The officer at whom Fred fired reeled in his saddle,
then straightened up and galloped to the rear.Colonel Fry fired at the
officer in the gray cloak.He threw up his arms, and then plunged
headlong to the ground.The bullet from Colonel Fry's pistol had pierced the heart of General
Zollicoffer.The battle now raged along the entire line with great fury.The lowering
clouds grew darker, and the pitiless rain, cold and icy, fell on the
upturned faces of the dead.The cruel storm beat upon the wounded, and
they shivered and moaned as their life's blood ebbed away.The smoke
settled down over the field and hid the combatants from view, but
through the gloom the flashes of the guns shone like fitful tongues of
flame.Then the Federal line began to press forward, and soon the whole
Confederate army was in full retreat.[Illustration: The Battle now raged along the entire line with great
fury.]It was at this time that Fred's attention was attracted to a young
Confederate officer, who was trying to rally his men.Bravely did he
strive to stay the panic, but suddenly Fred saw him falter, sway to and
fro, and then fall.Once more did the Confederates try to rally under
the leadership of a young mounted officer, but they were swept aside,
and the battle was over.Fred's first thought was for the young Confederate officer whom he saw
fall while trying to rally his men.There was something about him that
seemed familiar.Fred's heart stood still at the
thought.He was lying on his
side, his head resting on his left arm, his right hand still grasping
his sword, a smile on his face.As Fred looked on the placid face of the
dead, a groan burst from him, and the tears gushed from his eyes.With
his handkerchief he wiped away the grime of battle, and there, in all
his manly beauty, Bailie Peyton lay before him.Fred's thoughts flew
back to that day at Gallatin.No more would those eloquent lips hold
entranced a spellbound audience.No more would his fiery words stir the
hearts of his countrymen, even as the wind stirs the leaves of the
forest.Tenderly did Fred have him carried back and laid by the side of his
fallen chieftain.As soon as
possible the remains of both were forwarded through the lines to
Nashville.It was not the city that Fred saw in August.Then it was wild and
hilarious with joy, carried away with the pomp and glory of war.Zollicoffer was the idol of the people of Tennessee; Bailie Peyton of
its young men.That both should fall in the same battle plunged
Nashville in deepest mourning.When the bodies arrived, it was a city of tears.Flags floated at
half-mast; women walked the streets wringing their hands and weeping
bitter tears.She was to drink
still deeper of the bitter cup of war.Back over the ten miles that they had marched through the darkness and
rain, the Confederate army fled in the wildest confusion.Swift in
pursuit came the victorious army of Thomas.Before night his cannon were
shelling the entrenchments at Beech Grove.There was no rest for the
hungry, weary, despondent Confederates.In the darkness of the night
they stole across the river, and then fled, a demoralized mob, leaving
everything but themselves in the hands of the victors.The next morning an officer came to Fred and said one of the prisoners
would like to see him."One of the prisoners would like to see me," asked Fred, in surprise."I don't know," answered the officer."But he is a plucky chap; it's the
young lieutenant who headed the last rally of the Rebs.He fought until
he was entirely deserted by his men and surrounded by us; he then tried
to cut his way out, but his horse was shot and he captured.""It must be Calhoun," and he rushed to
where the prisoners were confined.And the boys were in each other's arms."Cal, you don't know how glad I am to see you," exclaimed Fred.answered Calhoun, with a dash of his old spirits."No," said Fred; "like St.Paul, I will say 'except these bonds.'But
Calhoun, I must have a good long talk with you in private.""Not much privacy here, Fred," said Calhoun, looking around at the crowd
that was staring at them.Fred went to General Thomas and told him that his cousin was among the
prisoners, and asked permission to take him to his quarters.The
permission was readily given, and the boys had the day and night to
themselves.How they did talk, and how much they had to tell each other!First Fred
had to tell Calhoun all about himself.When he had finished Calhoun grasped his hand and exclaimed: "Fred, I am
proud of you, if you are fighting with the Yanks.How I would like to
ride by your side!But of all your adventures, the one with poor Robert
Ferror touches me deepest.He must
have had a great deal of pure gold about him, notwithstanding his
cowardly crime.""He did," sighed Fred, "he did; and yet I can never think of the
assassination of Captain Bascom without a shudder.On the other hand, I
can never think of Ferror's death without tears.As I think of him now,
I am of the opinion that the indignities heaped upon him had, in a
measure, unbalanced his mind, and that the killing of Bascom was the act
of an insane person.But, Cal, I hate to talk about it; that night of
horrors always gives me the shivers."There is not much to tell," answered Calhoun."You know I left Danville
with your father for Bowling Green.Owing to the influence of my father,
I was commissioned a second lieutenant and given a place on the staff of
Governor Johnson.You know a provisional State government was organized
at Bowling Green, and G. M. Johnson appointed Governor.When General
Buckner tried to capture Louisville by surprise, and you objected by
throwing the train off the track, I was one of the victims of the
outrage.I recognized you, just as your father ordered the volley
fired."did he order that volley fired at
me?""Yes; but he did not know it was you when he gave the order.When I
called out it was you, he nearly fainted, and would have fallen if one
of his officers had not caught him.He wanted to resign then and there,
but General Buckner would not hear of it.Really, Fred, I think he would
have ordered that volley even if he had known you; but if you had been
killed, he would have killed himself afterward.""He loves me even if he has disowned me.""Well," continued Calhoun, "to make a long story short, I became
prodigiously jealous of you.You were covering yourself with glory while
I was sitting around doing nothing.As Zollicoffer appeared to be the only one of the Confederate generals
who was at all active, I asked and received permission to join him,
where I was given a roving commission as a scout.If I do say it, I made
it rather lively for you fellows.At length I hit upon a nice little
plan of capturing your pickets, and was quite successful until you found
it out and put an end to my fun.""Calhoun," exclaimed Fred, in surprise, "was it you with whom I had that
night fight?""It was, and you came near making an end of your hopeful cousin, I can
tell you.Out of seven men, I had two killed and four wounded.Only one
man and myself escaped unhurt, and I had three bullet holes through my
clothes.That put an end to my raids upon your pickets, and I confined
myself to scouting once more.Then came that unlucky fight with you in
the woods.Fred, I must congratulate you on the way you managed that.Your retreat showed me your exact strength, and I thought I could wipe
you off the face of the earth.Your sudden wheel and charge took us
completely by surprise, and disconcerted my men.That shot which cut my
bridle rein took me out of the fight, and perhaps it was just as well
for me that it did.When I came to and found out what had been done, I
at once knew you must have been in command of the squad, and if I could
I would have hugged you for your generosity.""Cal," replied Fred, his voice trembling with emotion, "you can hardly
realize my feelings when I saw you lying pale and senseless there before
me; it took all the fight out of me.""I know, I know," answered Calhoun, laying his hand caressingly on
Fred's shoulder."I was badly shaken up by that fall, but not seriously
hurt.Now, comes the most dangerous of my adventures.When I met you in
the road, I----"

"Stop!"broke in Fred, "not another word.Of course you were on one of
your scouting expeditions."A curious look came over Calhoun's face, and then he said, in a low
voice: "You are right, Fred; I was on one of my scouting expeditions,"
and he shuddered slightly."Fred," suddenly asked Calhoun, "is there any possible way for me to
keep from going to prison?""Sometimes prisoners give their parole," answered Fred."I will see what
can be done."The next morning General Thomas sent for Fred, and said that he was
about to send some dispatches to General Buell at Louisville."And,"
continued he, "owing to your splendid conduct and the value of the
services you have rendered, I have selected you as the messenger.Then,
in all probability, it will be very quiet in my front for some time,
and General Nelson may have more active work for you.You know," he
concluded with a smile, "I only have the loan of you."Fred heartily thanked the general for the honor bestowed, and then said:
"General, I have a great boon to ask.""You know my cousin is here a prisoner.He is more like a brother than a
cousin--the only brother I ever knew.The boon I ask is that you grant
him a parole."Calhoun was sent for, and soon stood in the presence of the general."An officer, I see," said the general, as he glanced Calhoun over."Yes, sir; Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Governor Johnson's staff,"
answered Calhoun, with dignity."What were you doing up here if you are one of Johnson's staff?""Lieutenant, your cousin has asked as a special favor that you be
granted a parole.He says that you reside in Danville, and as he is
going to Louisville, he would like to have you accompany him as far as
your home.""General," answered Calhoun, "you would place me under a thousand
obligations if you would grant me a parole; but only on one condition,
and that is that you effect my exchange as quickly as possible.""I see," said he, "that you and Shackelford are
alike; never satisfied unless you are in the thickest of the fray.The parole was made out, and Fred and Calhoun made preparations to start
for Danville.Never did two boys enjoy a ride more than they did.In spite of bad roads and bad weather, the exuberance of their spirits
knew no bounds.They were playmates again, without a word of difference
between them.As far as they were concerned, the clouds of war had
lifted, and they basked in the sunlight of peace."I say, Fred," remarked Calhoun, "this is something like it; seems like
old times.Why did this war have to come and separate us?""The war, Calhoun," he answered, "has laid a heavier hand
on me than on you, for it has made me an outcast from home.""Don't worry, Fred; it will come out all right," answered Calhoun,
cheerily.On the morning of the second day the boys met with an adventure for
which they were not looking.Even as early in the war as this, those
roving bands of guerrillas which afterward proved such a curse to the
border States began to appear.It was somewhat of a surprise to the boys
when four men suddenly rode out of the woods by the side of the road,
and roughly demanded that they give an account of themselves."By my authority," answered the leader, with a fearful oath."And your authority I refuse to acknowledge," was the hot answer."See here, young man, you had better keep a civil tongue in your head,"
and as the leader said this he significantly tapped the butt of his
revolver."I wish to know who you are, and where you are going, and that ----
quick."Sandra travelled to the bathroom."That is easily answered," replied Calhoun."As you see by my uniform, I
am a Confederate officer.I am on parole, and am on my way to my home in
Danville, there to wait until I am regularly exchanged.""And I suppose your companion is also
in the Confederate service.""Not at all," replied Fred, quietly."I am in the service of the United
States.""I think both of you are
Lincolnites.We will have to search you, and I think in the end shoot
you both.""Here is my parole," said Calhoun, his face growing red with anger.The man took it, glanced it over, and then coolly tore it in two, and
flung it down."Any one can carry such a paper as that.We
want them horses, and we want you.Boys, it will be fun to try our
marksmanship on these youngsters, won't it?"and he turned to his
companions with a brutal laugh.But the guerrillas made a great mistake; they thought they were only
dealing with two boys, and were consequently careless and off their
guard.With a sharp, quick look at Calhoun which meant volumes, Fred quickly
drew his revolver.There was a flash, a report, and the leader of the
guerrillas dropped from his horse.With a startled oath, the others drew
their revolvers, but before they could raise them there were two reports
so close together as almost to sound as one, and two more of the gang
rolled from their horses.The remaining one threw up his hands and began
to beg for mercy.[Illustration: Fred drew his Revolver, and the Guerrilla dropped from
his horse.]"You miscreant you," exclaimed Calhoun, covering him with his revolver."I ought to send a ball through your cowardly carcass, to be even with
my cousin here; for he got two of you, while I only got one.""You have; then so much the worse for the wife and children.""I am not fit to die," he blubbered."That is plain to be seen," answered Calhoun."Now hand me your weapons--butts first, remember.""Now pick up that parole your leader tore and threw down, and hand it to
me."Calhoun sat eyeing him a moment, and then continued: "I ought to shoot
you without mercy, but I believe in giving a dog a chance for his life,
and so I will give you a chance.You mount your horse, and when I say
'Go,' you go.After I say 'Go' I shall count five, and then shoot.If I
miss you, which I don't think I shall, I shall continue shooting as long
as you are in range; so the faster you go, the better for you.The man looked appealingly at Calhoun, but seeing no mercy, mounted his
horse as quick as his trembling limbs would let him.His face was white
with fear, and his teeth fairly rattled they chattered so.Calhoun reined his horse around so he was by the fellow's side.The man gave a yell of terror, bent low over his horse's neck and was
off like a shot.Calhoun with a chuckle fired over him, and the fellow
seemed to fairly flatten out.Four times did Calhoun fire, and at each
report the flying horseman appeared to go the faster.As for Fred, he was convulsed with merriment, notwithstanding the
grewsome surroundings."Leave these carrion where they are," said Calhoun in response to a
question from Fred as to what disposition they should make of the dead."That live companion of theirs will be back when we are gone."They rode along in silence for a while, and then Calhoun suddenly said:
"Fred, how I wish I could always fight by your side.It's a pity we have
to fight on different sides.""Just what I was thinking of, Cal," answered Fred; "but we have the
satisfaction of knowing we have fought one battle together.""And won it, too," shouted Calhoun.They reached Danville in due time and without further adventure.To say
that Judge Pennington was surprised to see them riding up together would
be to express it mildly; he was astounded.Then he had his arms around
his boy, and was sobbing, "My son!"And Fred, too," said the judge, at last turning from welcoming his son."I am truly glad to see you, my boy.But how in the world did you two
happen to come together?"Mary went to the garden.And so the whole story had to be told, and the judge listened and
wondered and mourned over the defeat of the Confederates at Mill
Springs."My boy," said the judge, with tears glistening in his eyes, "at least I
am glad to know that you did your duty.""If all the Confederates had
been like Calhoun, we might not have won the victory.""Unless all the Federals had been like you," responded Calhoun
gallantly.The judge would have both boys tell him the full particulars of their
adventures, and listened to their recital with all the pleasure of a
schoolboy.But when they were through, he shook his head sadly, and
said: "Boys, you can't keep that pace up.But I
am proud of you, proud of you both, if Fred is fighting for that
horrible Lincoln."It was a happy day Fred spent at his uncle's.If bitterness was felt towards him it was not shown.When it was noised about that both Calhoun and Fred had returned, they
were besieged with callers.The story of the battle of Mill Springs had
to be told again and again.Colonel Fry was one of the influential
citizens of the city, and especially were they eager to hear the
particulars of his killing General Zollicoffer.Fred concluded to ride his horse to Louisville, instead of riding to
Nicholasville or Lebanon and taking the cars from one of those places."I must have Prince wherever I go after this," he said.asked General Nelson, as Fred rode up to
his headquarters after a very prosaic journey of three days."It is no one else, General," laughed Fred, as he dismounted."Here I
am, here is my good horse, Prince, and here is a letter to you from
General Thomas."Nelson took the letter, read it, and looking up smiling, said: "I see
you still keep up your habit of doing something unusual.Thomas speaks
in the highest terms of your work.the first real victory we have
gained."Yes, General; I have voluminous dispatches for General Buell.I was so
eager to see you I stopped before delivering them.""Ah, my boy, I believe you do think something of bluff old Nelson after
all, even if he has a devil of a temper," and the general kindly patted
the boy on the head."You know, General," he said, brokenly,
"that you took me in, when my father cast me out.""For the good of the country, my boy, for the good of the country," said
the general brusquely."But, come, Fred, I will ride over to General
Buell's headquarters with you.I would like to see General Thomas' full
report of the battle."They found General Buell in the highest of spirits, and Fred was given a
warm welcome.He looked over General Thomas' report, and his whole face
beamed with satisfaction.He asked Fred a multitude of questions, and
was surprised at the knowledge of military affairs which he showed in
his answers."I think, General," said General Buell, turning to Nelson, after he had
dismissed Fred, "that you have not overestimated the abilities of your
protégé.In a private note General Thomas speaks in the highest terms of
him."Somehow I have taken wonderfully to
the boy."What it was General Buell was to do for Fred, that individual was in
ignorance.While in Louisville many of Fred's leisure moments were spent at the
hospitable home of the Vaughns.Mabel's betrothed was now at the front,
and it was astonishing how much note paper that young lady used in
writing to him."You don't write that often to your brother," said Fred, smiling.asked Mabel, looking up in surprise."Yes, your humble servant; didn't you adopt me as a brother?"she replied, "one doesn't have to write
so often to a brother.Lovers are like babies; they have to be petted.But to change the subject, where does my knight-errant expect to go for
his next adventure?""Things appear to be rather quiet just
now."But events were even then transpiring that were to take Fred to a
different theater of action.Commodore Foote and General U. S. Grant sat conversing in the
headquarters of the latter at Cairo, Illinois.The general was puffing a
cigar, and answered in monosyllables between puffs."You have heard nothing yet, have you, General," the commodore was
asking, "of that request we united in sending to General Halleck?"There was silence for some time, the general apparently in deep thought.The commodore broke the silence by asking:

"You went to see him personally once on this matter, did you not?""He ungraciously gave me permission to visit St.Louis in order to see
him, after I had begged for the privilege at least half a dozen times,"
Grant answered."And you laid the matter before him in all its bearings?"asked the commodore, starting in surprise."I mean," said he, "that he struck me metaphorically.I
don't believe he would have hurt me as badly, if he had really struck
me.I was never so cut in all my life.I came away feeling that I had
committed an unpardonable sin from a military standpoint.""Then he would not hear to the proposition at all?"I came away resolving never to ask
another favor of him.Yet so anxious am I to make this campaign that, as
you know, I swallowed my pride and united with you in making the request
that we be allowed to make the movement.""It is strange," replied the commodore, "that he should ignore both our
requests, not favoring us even with a reply.Yet it seems that he must
see that Fort Henry should be reduced at once.If we delay, both the
Cumberland and the Tennessee will be so strongly fortified that it will
be almost impossible to force a passage.Everything is to be gained by
moving at once."Even a civilian ought to see that," replied Grant, as he slowly blew a
cloud of smoke from his mouth, and watched it as it lazily curled
upward."The truth of it is," Grant continued slowly, as if weighing every word,
"too many of us are afraid that another general may win more honor than
we.Now, here are
Buell and myself; each with a separate command, yet both working for the
same object.I should either be subject to the command of Buell, or he
should be subject to my orders.We are now like two men trying to lift
the same burden, and instead of lifting together, one will lift and then
the other.Such a system can but prolong the war indefinitely.""General," said the commodore, earnestly, "I sincerely wish you had the
supreme command here in the West.I believe we would see different
results, and that very soon."Grant blushed like a schoolgirl, fidgeted in his seat, and then said:
"Commodore, you do me altogether too much honor.But this I will say, if
I had supreme command I should not sit still and see the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers fortified without raising a hand to prevent it.Neither do I believe in letting month after month go by for the purpose
of drilling and organizing.The Government seems to forget that time
gives the enemy the same privilege.What is wanted is hard blows, and
these blows should be delivered as soon as possible.Sherman was right
when he asked for 200,000 men to march to the Gulf, yet he was sneered
at by the War Department, hounded by every paper in the land, called
insane, and now he is occupying a subordinate position.The war could be
ended in a year.No one now can tell how long it will last."Just then a telegram was placed in Grant's hands.He read it, and his
whole face lighted up with pleasure."You look pleased," said the commodore."The telegram must bring good
news."Without a word Grant placed the telegram in the hands of the commodore.It was an order from General Halleck to move up the Tennessee as soon as
possible and capture Fort Henry."At last," said the commodore, his face showing as much pleasure as did
Grant's."At last," responded Grant; and then, quickly, "Commodore, we may have
done an injustice to General Halleck.There may be good reasons we know
not of why this order should not have been made before.Commodore, be
ready to move with your fleet to-morrow.""General, I shall be ready; and now good-bye, for both of us have much
before us.But before I go, let me congratulate you.I believe that
success and great honor await you," and with these words the commodore
withdrew.The next day, with 15,000 men, General Grant was steaming up the
Tennessee.General Buell sat in his headquarters at Louisville.General Nelson,
accompanied by Fred, had dropped in to see his general, and at the same
time to give vent to some of his pent-up feelings.he fumed, "for us to sit here and let the
Rebels fortify Bowling Green and Dover and Columbus, and build forts to
blockade the Tennessee, and we not raise a finger to prevent it."Buell smiled at his irate general, and asked: "And what would you do,
Nelson?"I would give
them precious little time to build forts."Before General Buell could answer, an orderly entered with a telegram.He read it, and turning to Nelson, said:

"Well, General, you can cease your fuming.This telegram is from General
Halleck.He tells me he has ordered General Grant up the Tennessee to
reduce Fort Henry, and he wants me to co-operate as much as possible in
the movement."Nelson was on his feet in an instant."General," he exclaimed, "I have a favor, a great favor to ask of you."Buell smilingly answered: "I think I know what it is without your
asking."I do not see how I can spare so many men; you know we have Johnston at
Bowling Green to look after.""But General," answered Nelson, "the Tennessee and Cumberland must be
defended.In all probability the most of Johnston's army will be
transferred there.""In that case, General," answered Buell, "I will remember you.Your
division shall be the first one sent.""Thank you, General, thank you," replied Nelson."I only wish I knew I
was going.""As it is now," continued Buell, "I shall order General Crittenden to
send Cruft's brigade.That brigade is near the mouth of Green river.There is no force of the enemy, in any number, before them, and the
brigade can well be spared.I shall send no more men unless it is
absolutely necessary.I shall at once dispatch an officer to General
Crittenden with necessary orders.""General," now spoke up Fred, "like General Nelson, I have a request to
make, and by your kindness I hope to meet with better success."said Buell, "you wish to carry the orders.If Nelson has no
objection, I think I can grant that request.The general has told me
something of your history, Mr.General Thomas also speaks
in the highest terms of you.""You can go if you wish, Fred," answered Nelson."I only hope I shall
soon be with you."So it was settled, and before night Fred and his good horse Prince were
on their way down the Ohio.Fred not only carried dispatches to General
Crittenden, but he had personal letters both from General Buell and
General Nelson to General Cruft commending him to the latter officer.Disembarking at Owensboro, Fred made a swift ride to Calhoun, the
headquarters of General Crittenden.He delivered his dispatches to the
general, and at once sought the headquarters of General Cruft.The
general read Fred's letters, and then said: "You are very welcome, Mr.Shackelford; you may consider yourself as one of my staff until such
time as General Nelson may join us."Soon orders came to General Cruft to at once prepare to join Grant.It was nearly noon on February the 14th when the fleet on which General
Cruft's brigade had embarked arrived at Fort Donelson.The place had
already been invested two days, and some severe fighting had taken
place.The weather, from being warm and rainy, had suddenly turned cold
on the afternoon of the 13th, and Fred shivered as he emerged from the
comfortable cabin of the steamboat and stepped out on the cold, desolate
bank of the river.The ground was covered with ice and snow, and the
scene was dreary in the extreme.Now and then the heavy reverberation of a cannon came rolling down the
river, and echoed and re-echoed among the hills.A fleet of gunboats lay
anchored in the river, the mouths of their great guns looking out over
the dark sullen water as though watching for their prey.General Cruft's
brigade was assigned to the division of General Lew Wallace, which
occupied the center of the Federal army.Back in the rear little groups
of soldiers stood shivering around small fires, trying to warm their
benumbed limbs, or to cook their scanty rations.The condition of the soldiers was pitiable in the extreme.There were
no tents; but few had overcoats, and many on the hard, muddy march from
Fort Henry had even thrown away their blankets.In the front lines no
fires could be lighted, and there the soldiers stood, exposed to the
furious storm of sleet and snow, hungry, benumbed, hardly knowing
whether they were dead or alive.Such were the heroes who stood for
three days before Donelson.As Fred looked on all this suffering, he wondered at the fortitude with
which it was endured.There were few complaints from the soldiers; they
were even cheerful and eager to meet the foe.About three o'clock the gunboats came steaming up the river and engaged
the Confederate batteries.It was a most sublime spectacle, and held Fred spellbound.The very
heavens seemed splitting, and the earth shook and trembled from the
heavy concussions.Nearer and nearer the gunboats came to the batteries
until it seemed to Fred the great guns were vomiting fire and smoke into
each other's throats.During the fight Fred noticed a small, thickset man sitting on his horse
intently watching the fight.His countenance was perfectly impassive,
and one could not tell by watching him whether he sympathized with
friend or foe.The boilers of the Essex had been
blown up, the other boats were bruised and battered and torn by the
great shots which had struck them, and were helplessly drifting down
the stream.From the Federal side there
went up a great groan of disappointment, while from the Confederate
lines there arose the wild cheers of victory.The silent man on horseback turned and rode away.Not a sign, not a word
that he was disappointed.asked Fred of an officer standing by him."That, young man," was the answer, "is General Grant.He must be awfully
cut up, but he does not show it."Fred turned and looked after Grant as he rode slowly away."There,"
thought Fred, "is a man who is going to make his mark in this war.In
some of his actions he reminds me of General Thomas.On the frozen ground, without tents or fire,
the soldiers once more made their beds.The wind sighed and moaned
through the bare branches, as if weeping at the suffering it caused.Many, to keep from freezing, never lay down, but kept up a weary march,
so that the blood might circulate.A council of war was
held, and it was resolved that in the morning they would cut their way
through the lines of steel which Grant had thrown around them.All
preparations were made, every order given, and then they waited for the
light of morning--the last morning that hundreds would ever see.It was hardly light when Fred was awakened by the fitful sound of
musketry over on the right.In front of Wallace's division only the
report of a rifle of a picket was heard now and then.Hurriedly eating a
little breakfast, he mounted his horse and reported to General Cruft for
duty.The men were all standing at arms, but there was nothing for them
to do.But over on the right the rattle of musketry grew more intense,
the roll of heavy volleys began to be heard, and then the deep-voiced
cannon joined in the chorus.Louder and louder grew the din of the
conflict.The smoke of battle began to ascend above the treetops like
smoke from a burning coal-pit.The sound of battle came nearer, the roll
of musketry was incessant, the thunder of cannon never ceased.An officer wild with excitement came spurring his foaming horse up to
General Wallace."General McClernand wants help," he gasped."The whole Rebel army has
attacked his division.""I have orders from General Grant to hold this position at all hazards,"
replied Wallace.To Grant's headquarters the officer rides in frantic haste.The general
was away; he had started at five o'clock to see Commodore Foote, who had
been wounded in the battle of the night before, and was on board of one
of his gunboats, and the boats lay some five or six miles below.Would not some one of his staff give orders to send reinforcements to
McClernand.The officer groaned,
and rode back to McClernand with the heavy tidings.Minutes go by, the thunder of battle is terrific.The exultant cheering of the advancing foe is heard above the
roar of conflict.Another officer, with his horse bleeding from wounds, his hat gone, and
tears streaming down his face, rides to General Wallace."For God's
sake, help!"he gasps, "or everything is lost; we are flanked, we cannot
hold out longer."Then General Wallace said: "I will take the responsibility; help you
shall have."And with his face lighted up with joy the officer dashed
back to tell McClernand that help was coming.An order comes to General Cruft to at once march his brigade to the
scene of action.No sooner is the command given than the brigade is on
the way.Soon shot and shell are crashing overhead, and singing bullets
begin to cut the twigs of the bushes around.Now and then a soldier
falters and goes down.A smooth-faced, florid man rides up to General
Cruft."I am Colonel Oglesby," he says; "my brigade is being flanked on
the right.Let me lead you in position; my men are nearly out of
ammunition."And then as calmly as if on parade Colonel Dick Oglesby
leads Cruft's brigade to the relief of his men.Soon the brigade is in
the midst of the conflict.The excitement of battle is on him, and he feels no fear.Oglesby's brigade is out of ammunition.Sullenly his men fall back,
leaving over 800 of their number dead and wounded on the field, but his
left regiment refuses to go.The colonel, a large, dark man, with hair
as black as midnight, eyes like flaming stars, rages up and down the
line like a lion.Fred asks of a wounded soldier hobbling back."Colonel John A. Logan," is the answer.At last his men are out of ammunition, and Logan, bleeding from two
wounds, is obliged to lead his regiment back.Another regiment takes its
place, and after a dreadful conflict, is compelled to fall back, leaving
over 300 of their number dead and wounded.Cruft's brigade was now on the extreme right, cut off from the rest of
the army.The enemy pressed upon them; a withering volley sent them
reeling back.Fred spurred forward, and seizing
the colors of a Kentucky regiment, shouted: "Now, boys, for the honor of
old Kentucky."But on either flank
the enemy pressed, and the brigade, combating every foot, was forced
back.The enemy had gained the desired end; McClernand's division was out of
the way, the road to retreat was open.Because of the imbecility of Generals Floyd and Pillow.Broken, and with a third of its number dead and wounded, McClernand's
division is driven back on Lew Wallace.Officers, stunned with the
disaster, come wildly galloping through Wallace's lines, shouting, "All
is lost!Wallace changes front to meet the exultant, advancing foe.Firm as
adamant his lines stand.In the faces of the charging Confederates his
men pour their crushing volleys.The enemy waver, reel, then go
staggering, bleeding back.In conference with Commodore Foote on
board of a gunboat six miles down the river.He is too far away to hear
the roll of musketry, and the thunder of artillery he thinks but
cannonading between the two lines.It is past noon when the conference
is ended and he is rowed ashore.There stands a staff officer with
bloodless face and shaking limbs.In a few words the story of the
disaster is told.Without a word Grant listens, and then mounts his
horse.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was also armed
with five 30-pounder Parrott rifled guns, one 10-inch siege-mortar and one
24-pounder Coehorn mortar.Three of the platforms for siege-guns remained
vacant.[Illustration: COMPANY K, THIRD MASSACHUSETTS HEAVY ARTILLERY, IN FORT

of Fort Stevens, on the Seventh Street road, not far from the Soldiers'
Home, where President Lincoln was spending the summer.The campaign for
his reelection had begun and the outlook for his success and that of his
party seemed at this moment as dubious as that for the conclusion of the
war.Grant had weakened his lines about Richmond in order to protect
Washington, while Lee had been able to detach Early's Corps for the
brilliant Valley Campaign, which saved his Shenandoah supplies.[Illustration: GENERAL SHERIDAN'S "WINCHESTER"

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were
