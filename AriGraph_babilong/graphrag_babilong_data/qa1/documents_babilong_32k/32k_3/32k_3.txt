One of the disagreeable features of living in Johannesburg is the dust
which is present everywhere during the dry season.It rises in great,
thick clouds on the surrounding veldt, and, obscuring the sun, wholly
envelops the city in semi-darkness.One minute the air is clear and
there is not a breath of wind; several minutes later a hurricane is
blowing and blankets of dust are falling.The dust clouds generally
rise west of the city, and almost totally eclipse the sun during their
progress over the plain.Sometimes the dust storms continue only a few
minutes, but very frequently the citizens are made uncomfortable by them
for days at a time.Whenever they arrive, the doors and windows of
buildings are tightly closed, business is practically at a standstill,
and every one is miserable.It penetrates
every building, however well protected, and it lodges in the food as
well as in the drink.Pedestrians on the street are unable to see ten
feet ahead, and are compelled to walk with head bowed and with
handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils.Umbrellas and parasols are
but slight protection against it.Only the miners, a thousand feet
below the surface, escape it.When the storm has subsided the entire
city is covered with a blanket of dust ranging in thickness from an inch
on the sidewalks to an eighth of an inch on the store counters,
furniture, and in pantries.It has never been computed how great a
quantity of the dust enters a man's lungs, but the feeling that it
engenders is one of colossal magnitude.Second to the dust, the main characteristic of Johannesburg is the
inhabitants' great struggle for sudden wealth.It is doubtful whether
there is one person in the city whose ambition is less than to become
wealthy in five years at least, and then to return to his native
country.It is not a chase after affluence; it is a stampede in which
every soul in the city endeavours to be in the van.In the city and in
the mines there are hundreds of honourable ways of becoming rich, but
there are thousands of dishonourable ones; and the morals of a mining
city are not always on the highest plane.There are business men of the
strictest probity and honesty, and men whose word is as good as their
bond, but there are many more who will allow their conscience to lie
dormant so long as they remain in the country.With them the passion is
to secure money, and whether they secure it by overcharging a regular
customer, selling illicit gold, or gambling at the stock exchanges is a
matter of small moment.Tradesmen and shopkeepers will charge according
to the apparel of the patron, and will brazenly acknowledge doing so if
reminded by the one who has paid two prices for like articles the same
day.Hotels charge according to the quantity of luggage the traveller
carries, and boarding-houses compute your wealth before presenting their
bills.Street-car fares and postage stamps alone do not fluctuate in
value, but the wise man counts his change.The experiences of an American with one large business house in the city
will serve as an example of the methods of some of those who are eager
to realize their ambitions.The American spent many weeks and much
patience and money in securing photographs throughout the country, and
took the plates to a large firm in Johannesburg for development and
printing.When he returned two weeks later he was informed that the
plates and prints had been delivered a week before, and neither prayers
nor threats secured a different answer.Justice in the courts is slow
and costly, and the American was obliged to leave the country without
his property.Shortly after his departure the firm of photographers
commenced selling a choice collection of new South African photographs
which, curiously, were of the same scenes and persons photographed by
the American.Gambling may be more general in some other cities, but it can not be
more public.The more refined gamblers patronize the two stock
exchanges, and there are but few too poor to indulge in that form of
dissipation.Probably nine tenths of the inhabitants of the city travel
the stock-exchange bypath to wealth or poverty.Women and boys are as
much infected by the fever as mine owners and managers, and it would not
be slandering the citizens to say that one fourth of the conversation
heard on the streets refers to the rise and fall of stocks.The popular gathering place in the city is the street in front of one of
the stock exchanges known as "The Chains."During the session of the
exchange the street is crowded with an excited throng of men, boys, and
even women, all flushed with the excitement of betting on the rise and
fall of mining stocks in the building.Clerks, office boys, and miners
spend the lunch hour at "The Chains," either to invest their wages or to
watch the market if their money is already invested.A fall in the
value of stocks is of far greater moment to them than war, famine, or
pestilence.The passion for gambling is also satisfied by a giant lottery scheme
known as "Sweepstakes," which has the sanction of the Government.Thousands of pounds are offered as prizes at the periodical drawings,
and no true Johannesburger ever fails to secure at least one ticket for
the drawing.When there are no sessions of the stock exchanges, no
sweepstakes, horse races, ball games, or other usual opportunities for
gambling, they will bet on the arrival of the Cape train, the length of
a sermon, or the number of lashes a <DW64> criminal can endure before
fainting.Drinking is a second diversion which occupies much of the time of the
average citizen, because of the great heat and the lack of amusement.The liquor that is drunk in Johannesburg in one year would make a stream
of larger proportions and far more healthier contents than the Vaal
River in the dry season.It is a rare occurrence to see a man drink
water unless it is concealed in brandy, and at night it is even rarer
that one is seen who is not drinking.Cape Smoke, the name given to a
liquor made in Cape Colony, is credited with the ability to kill a man
before he has taken the glass from his lips, but the popular Uitlander
beverage, brandy and soda, is even more fatal in its effects.Pure
liquor is almost unobtainable, and death-dealing counterfeits from
Delagoa Bay are the substitutes.Twenty-five cents for a glass of beer
and fifty cents for brandy and soda are not deterrent prices where
ordinary mine workers receive ten dollars a day and mine managers fifty
thousand dollars a year.Of social life there is little except such as is afforded by the clubs,
of which there are several of high standing.The majority of the men
left their families in their native countries on account of the severe
climate, and that fact, combined with the prevalent idea that the
weather is too torrid to do anything unnecessary, is responsible for
Johannesburg's lack of social amenity.There are occasional dances and
receptions, but they are participated in only by newcomers who have not
yet fallen under the spell of the South African sun.The Sunday night's
musical entertainments at the Wanderer's Club are practically the only
affairs to which the average Uitlander cares to go, because he can
clothe himself for comfort and be as dignified or as undignified as he
pleases.The true Johannesburger is the most independent man in the world.When
he meets a native on the sidewalk he promptly kicks him into the street,
and if the action is resented, bullies a Boer policeman into arresting
the offender.The policeman may demur and call the Johannesburger a
"Verdomde rooinek," but he will make the arrest or receive a drubbing.He may be arrested in turn, but he is ever willing and anxious to pay a
fine for the privilege of beating a "dumb Dutchman," as he calls him.He pays little attention to the laws of the country, because he has not
had the patience to learn what they consist of, and he rests content in
knowing that his home government will rescue him through diplomatic
channels if he should run counter to the laws.He cares nothing
concerning the government of the city except as it interferes with or
assists his own private interests, but he will take advantage of every
opportunity to defy the authority of the administrators of the laws.He
despises the Boers, and continually and maliciously ridicules them on
the slightest pretexts.Specially true is this of those newspapers
which are the representatives of the Uitlander population.Venomous
editorials against the Boer Government and people appear almost daily,
and serve to widen the breach between the two classes of inhabitants.The Boer newspapers for a long time ignored the assaults of the
Uitlander press, but recently they have commenced to retaliate, and the
editorial war is a bitter one.An extract from the Randt Post will show
the nature and depth of bitterness displayed by the two classes of
newspapers:

"Though Dr.Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.He knew the
singer was telling the pathetic story of the passing of the day of the
Indian's glory and the advent of the day of his humiliation.With sharp
rising inflections, with staccato phrasing and with fierce passionate
intonation, the Sioux wrung the hearts of his hearers.Again Cameron
glanced at the half-breed at his side and again he was startled to note
the transformation in his face.Where there had been glowing pride there
was now bitter savage hate.For that hour at least the half-breed was
all Sioux.His father's blood was the water in his veins, the red was
only his Indian mother's.With face drawn tense and lips bared into
a snarl, with eyes gleaming, he gazed fascinated upon the face of the
singer.In imagination, in instinct, in the deepest emotions of his soul
Jerry was harking back again to the savage in him, and the savage in him
thirsting for revenge upon the white man who had wrought this ruin upon
him and his Indian race.With a fine dramatic instinct the Sioux reached
his climax and abruptly ceased.A low moaning murmur ran round the
circle and swelled into a sobbing cry, then ceased as suddenly as there
stepped into the circle a stranger, evidently a half-breed, who began to
speak.He was a French Cree, he announced, and delivered his message in
the speech, half Cree, half French, affected by his race.He had come fresh from the North country, from the disturbed district,
and bore, as it appeared, news of the very first importance from those
who were the leaders of his people in the unrest.At his very first
word Jerry drew a long deep breath and by his face appeared to drop from
heaven to earth.As the half-breed proceeded with his tale his speech
increased in rapidity.said Cameron after they had listened for
some minutes.said Jerry, whose vocabulary had been learned
mostly by association with freighters and the Police."He tell 'bout
beeg meeting, beeg man Louis Riel mak' beeg noise.The whole scene had lost for Jerry its mystic impressiveness and had
become contemptibly commonplace.This was the
part that held meaning for him.So he pulled up the half-breed with a
quick, sharp command."Listen close," he said, "and let me know what he says."And as Jerry interpreted in his broken English the half-breed's speech
it appeared that there was something worth learning.At this big
meeting held in Batoche it seemed a petition of rights, to the Dominion
Parliament no less, had been drawn up, and besides this many plans had
been formed and many promises made of reward for all those who dared to
stand for their rights under the leadership of the great Riel, while
for the Indians very special arrangements had been made and the most
alluring prospects held out.For they were assured that, when in the far
North country the new Government was set up, the old free independent
life of which they had been hearing was to be restored, all hampering
restrictions imposed by the white man were to be removed, and the
good old days were to be brought back.The effect upon the Indians was
plainly evident.With solemn faces they listened, nodding now and
then grave approval, and Cameron felt that the whole situation held
possibilities of horror unspeakable in the revival of that ancient
savage spirit which had been so very materially softened and tamed
by years of kindly, patient and firm control on the part of those
who represented among them British law and civilization.His original
intention had been to stride in among these Indians, to put a stop to
their savage nonsense and order them back to their reserves with never a
thought of anything but obedience on their part.But as he glanced about
upon the circle of faces he hesitated.This was no petty outbreak of
ill temper on the part of a number of Indians dissatisfied with their
rations or chafing under some new Police regulation.As his eye traveled
round the circle he noted that for the most part they were young men.A few of the councilors of the various tribes represented were present.Many of them he knew, but many others he could not distinguish in the
dim light of the fire.And as Jerry ran over the names he began to realize how widely
representative of the various tribes in the western country the
gathering was.Practically every reserve in the West was represented:
Bloods, Piegans and Blackfeet from the foothill country, Plain Crees and
Wood Crees from the North.Even a few of the Stonies, who were supposed
to have done with all pagan rites and to have become largely civilized,
were present.They were the
picked braves of the tribes, and with them a large number of the younger
chiefs.At length the half-breed Cree finished his tale, and in a few brief
fierce sentences he called the Indians of the West to join their
half-breed and Indian brothers of the North in one great effort to
regain their lost rights and to establish themselves for all time in
independence and freedom.Then followed grave discussion carried on with deliberation and courtesy
by those sitting about the fire, and though gravity and courtesy marked
every utterance there thrilled through every speech an ever deepening
intensity of feeling.The fiery spirit of the red man, long subdued by
those powers that represented the civilization of the white man, was
burning fiercely within them.The insatiable lust for glory formerly won
in war or in the chase, but now no longer possible to them, burned in
their hearts like a consuming fire.The life of monotonous struggle for
a mere existence to which they were condemned had from the first been
intolerable to them.The prowess of their fathers, whether in the
slaughter of foes or in the excitement of the chase, was the theme of
song and story round every Indian camp-fire and at every sun dance.For the young braves, life, once vivid with color and thrilling with
tingling emotions, had faded into the somber-hued monotony of a dull and
spiritless existence, eked out by the charity of the race who had robbed
them of their hunting-grounds and deprived them of their rights as free
men.The lust for revenge, the fury of hate, the yearning for the return
of the days of the red man's independence raged through their speeches
like fire in an open forest; and, ever fanning yet ever controlling the
flame, old Copperhead presided till the moment should be ripe for such
action as he desired.Should they there and then pledge themselves to their Northern brothers
and commit themselves to this great approaching adventure?Quietly and with an air of judicial deliberation the Sioux put the
question to them.There was something to be lost and something to be
gained.And the gain, how
immeasurable!A few scattered settlers with no arms nor ammunition, with
no means of communication, what could they effect?A Government nearly
three thousand miles away, with the nearest base of military operations
a thousand miles distant, what could they do?The only real difficulty
was the North West Mounted Police.But even as the Sioux uttered the
words a chill silence fell upon the excited throng.The North West
Mounted Police, who for a dozen years had guarded them and cared for
them and ruled them without favor and without fear!Five hundred red
coats of the Great White Mother across the sea, men who had never been
known to turn their backs upon a foe, who laughed at noisy threats and
whose simple word their greatest chief was accustomed unhesitatingly to
obey!Small wonder that the mere mention of the name of those gallant
"Riders of the Plains" should fall like a chill upon their fevered
imaginations.The Sioux was conscious of that chill and set himself to
counteract it.he cried with unspeakable scorn, "the Police!They will
flee before the Indian braves like leaves before the autumn wind."Without a moment's hesitation Cameron sprang to his feet and, standing
in the dim light at the entrance to the cave, with arm outstretched and
finger pointed at the speaker, he cried:

"Listen!"With a sudden start every face was turned in his direction.Never have the Indians seen a Policeman's back turned in
flight."His unexpected appearance, his voice ringing like the blare of a trumpet
through the cavern, his tall figure with the outstretched accusing arm
and finger, the sharp challenge of the Sioux's lie with what they all
knew to be the truth, produced an effect utterly indescribable.For
some brief seconds they gazed upon him stricken into silence as with a
physical blow, then with a fierce exclamation the Sioux snatched a rifle
from the cave side and quicker than words can tell fired straight at
the upright accusing figure.But quicker yet was Jerry's panther-spring.With a backhand he knocked Cameron flat, out of range.Cameron dropped
to the floor as if dead."What the deuce do you mean, Jerry?""You nearly knocked the
wind out of me!"grunted Jerry fiercely, dragging him back into the
tunnel out of the light.cried Cameron in a rage, struggling to free himself
from the grip of the wiry half-breed.hissed Jerry, laying his hand over Cameron's mouth."Indian mad--crazy--tak' scalp sure queeck.""Let me go, Jerry, you little fool!""I'll kill you if you
don't!I want that Sioux, and, by the eternal God, I am going to have
him!"He shook himself free of the half-breed's grasp and sprang to his
feet.cried Jerry again, flinging himself upon him and winding his
arms about him.Indian mad crazy--keel quick--no
talk--now."Up and down the tunnel Cameron dragged him about as a mastiff might
a terrier, striving to free himself from those gripping arms.Even as
Jerry spoke, through the dim light the figure of an Indian could be seen
passing and repassing the entrance to the cave."We get him soon," said Jerry in an imploring whisper."Come back
now--queeck--beeg hole close by."With a great effort Cameron regained his self-control."By Jove, you are right, Jerry," he said quietly."We certainly can't
take him now.This
passage opens on to the canyon about fifty yards farther down.Follow,
and keep your eye on the Sioux.Without an instant's hesitation Jerry obeyed, well aware that his master
had come to himself and again was in command.Cameron meantime groped to the mouth of the tunnel by which he had
entered and peered out into the dim light.Close to his hand stood an
Indian in the cavern.Beyond him there was a confused mingling of forms
as if in bewilderment.The Council was evidently broken up for the time.The Indians were greatly shaken by the vision that had broken in upon
them.That it was no form of flesh and blood was very obvious to them,
for the Sioux's bullet had passed through it and spattered against the
wall leaving no trail of blood behind it.There was no holding them
together, and almost before he was aware of it Cameron saw the cavern
empty of every living soul.Quickly but warily he followed, searching
each nook as he went, but the dim light of the dying fire showed him
nothing but the black walls and gloomy recesses of the great cave.At
the farther entrance he found Jerry awaiting him."Beeg camp close by," replied Jerry.Some
talk-talk, then go sleep.Chief Onawata he mak' more talk--talk all
night--then go sleep.Now you get back quick for the men
and come to me here in the morning.We must not spoil the chance of
capturing this old devil.He will have these Indians worked up into
rebellion before we know where we are."So saying, Cameron set forward that he might with his own eyes look upon
the camp and might the better plan his further course.First, that he should break up this council
which held such possibilities of danger to the peace of the country.And
secondly, and chiefly, he must lay hold of this Sioux plotter, not only
because of the possibilities of mischief that lay in him, but because of
the injury he had done him and his.Forward, then, he went and soon came upon the camp, and after observing
the lay of it, noting especially the tent in which the Sioux Chief had
disposed himself, he groped back to his cave, in a nook of which--for
he was nearly done out with weariness, and because much yet lay before
him--he laid himself down and slept soundly till the morning.CHAPTER XIII

IN THE BIG WIGWAM


Long before the return of the half-breed and his men Cameron was astir
and to some purpose.A scouting expedition around the Indian camp
rewarded him with a significant and useful discovery.Sandra moved to the garden.In a bluff some
distance away he found the skins and heads of four steers, and by
examination of the brands upon the skins discovered two of them to be
from his own herd."All right, my braves," he muttered."There will be a reckoning for this
some day not so far away.Meantime this will help this day's work."A night's sleep and an hour's quiet consideration had shown him the
folly of a straight frontal attack upon the Indians gathered for
conspiracy.They were too deeply stirred for anything like the usual
brusque manner of the Police to be effective.A slight indiscretion,
indeed, might kindle such a conflagration as would sweep the whole
country with the devastating horror of an Indian war.He recalled the
very grave manner of Inspector Dickson and resolved upon an entirely
new plan of action.At all costs he must allay suspicion that the Police
were at all anxious about the situation in the North.Further, he must
break the influence of the Sioux Chief over these Indians.Lastly, he
was determined that this arch-plotter should not escape him again.The sun was just visible over the lowest of the broken foothills when
Jerry and the two constables made their appearance, bringing, with them
Cameron's horse.After explaining to them fully his plan and emphasizing
the gravity of the situation and the importance of a quiet, cool and
resolute demeanor, they set off toward the Indian encampment."I have no intention of stirring these chaps up," laid Cameron, "but I
am determined to arrest old Copperhead, and at the right moment we must
act boldly and promptly.He is too dangerous and much too clever to be
allowed his freedom among these Indians of ours at this particular time.Now, then, Jerry and I will ride in looking for cattle and prepared to
charge these Indians with cattle-stealing.This will put them on the
defensive.You two will remain within sound
of whistle, but failing specific direction let each man act on his own
initiative."Before the
day was over he was to see him in an entirely new role.Nothing in life
afforded Jerry such keen delight as a bit of cool daring successfully
carried through.Hence with joyous heart he followed Cameron into the
Indian camp.The morning hour is the hour of coolest reason.The fires of emotion and
imagination have not yet begun to burn.The reactions from anything
like rash action previously committed under the stimulus of a heated
imagination are caution and timidity, and upon these reactions Cameron
counted when he rode boldly into the Indian camp.With one swift glance his eye swept the camp and lighted upon the Sioux
Chief in the center of a group of younger men, his tall commanding
figure and haughty carriage giving him an outstanding distinction over
those about him.At his side stood a young Piegan Chief, Eagle Feather
by name, whom Cameron knew of old as a restless, talkative Indian, an
ambitious aspirant for leadership without the qualities necessary to
such a position."Ah, good morning, Eagle
Feather!"Eagle Feather grunted an indistinct reply.Are you in command of this party, Eagle Feather?The Piegan turned and pointed to a short thick set man standing by
another fire, whose large well shaped head and penetrating eye indicated
both force and discretion.I
am glad to see you, for I wish to talk to a man of wisdom."Slowly and with dignified, almost unwilling step Running Stream
approached.As he began to move, but not before, Cameron went to meet
him."I wish to talk with you," said Cameron in a quiet firm tone."I have a matter of importance to speak to you about," continued
Cameron.Running Stream's keen glance searched his face somewhat anxiously."I find, Running Stream, that your young men are breaking faith with
their friends, the Police."Again the Chief searched Cameron's face with that keen swift glance, but
he said not a word, only waited."They are breaking the law as well, and I want to tell you they will be
punished.Where did they get the meat for these kettles?"A look of relief gleamed for one brief instant across the Indian's face,
not unnoticed, however, by Cameron."Why do your young men steal my cattle?""Dunno--deer--mebbe--sheep.""My brother speaks like a child," said Cameron quietly."Do deer and
sheep have steers' heads and hides with brands on?The Commissioner will ask you to explain these hides and
heads, and let me tell you, Running Stream, that the thieves will spend
some months in jail.They will then have plenty of time to think of
their folly and their wickedness."An ugly glance shot from the Chief's eyes."Dunno," he grunted again, then began speaking volubly in the Indian
tongue."I know you can
speak English well enough."But Running Stream shook his head and continued his speech in Indian,
pointing to a bluff near by.Cameron looked toward Jerry, who interpreted:

"He say young men tak' deer and sheep and bear."Come," said Running Stream, supplementing Jerry's interpretation and
making toward the bluff.Cameron followed him and came upon the skins of
three jumping deer, of two mountain sheep and of two bear.John went to the office."My young men no take cattle," said the Chief with haughty pride."Maybe so," said Cameron, "but some of your party have, Running Stream,
and the Commissioner will look to you.He will
give you a chance to clear yourself.""My brother is not doing well," continued Cameron."The Government feed
you if you are hungry.The Government protect you if you are wronged."A sudden cloud of anger
darkened the Indian's face."My children--my squaw and my people go hungry--go
cold in winter--no skin--no meat.""My brother knows--" replied Cameron with patient firmness--"You
translate this, Jerry"--and Jerry proceeded to translate with eloquence
and force--"the Government never refuse you meat.Last winter your
people would have starved but for the Government.""No," cried the Indian again in harsh quick reply, the rage in his
face growing deeper, "my children cry--Indian cannot sleep--my white
brother's ears are closed.He hear only the wind--the storm--he sound
sleep.For me no sleep--my children cry too loud.""My brother knows," replied Cameron, "that the Government is far away,
that it takes a long time for answer to come back to the Indian cry.But the answer came and the Indian received flour and bacon and tea and
sugar, and this winter will receive them again.But how can my brother
expect the Government to care for his people if the Indians break the
law?These Indians are bad Indians and the Police will
punish the thieves.A thief is a bad man and ought to be punished."Suddenly a new voice broke in abruptly upon the discourse."Who steal the Indian's hunting-ground?It was the voice of Onawata, the Sioux
Chief.Cameron paid no heed to the ringing voice.He kept his back turned upon
the Sioux."My brother knows," he continued, addressing himself to Running Stream,
"that the Indian's best friend is the Government, and the Police are the
Government's ears and eyes and hands and are ready always to help the
Indians, to protect them from fraud, to keep away the whisky-peddlers,
to be to them as friends and brothers.But my brother has been listening
to a snake that comes from another country and that speaks with a forked
tongue.Running Stream knows
this to be no lie, but the truth.Nor did the Government drive away the
buffalo from the Indians.The buffalo were driven away by the Sioux from
the country of the snake with the forked tongue.My brother remembers
that only a few years ago when the people to which this lying snake
belongs came over to this country and tried to drive away from their
hunting-grounds the Indians of this country, the Police protected the
Indians and drove back the hungry thieving Sioux to their own land.And
now a little bird has been telling me that this lying snake has been
speaking into the ears of our Indian brothers and trying to persuade
them to dig up the hatchet against their white brothers, their friends.The Police know all about this and laugh at it.The Police know about
the foolish man at Batoche, the traitor Louis Riel.They know he is
a liar and a coward.He leads brave men astray and then runs away and
leaves them to suffer.And Cameron
proceeded to give a brief sketch of the fantastic and futile rebellion
of 1870 and of the ignoble part played by the vain and empty-headed
Riel.The effect of Cameron's words upon the Indians was an amazement even to
himself.They forgot their breakfast and gathered close to the speaker,
their eager faces and gleaming eyes showing how deeply stirred were
their hearts.Cameron was putting into his story an intensity of emotion and passion
that not only surprised himself, but amazed his interpreter.Indeed so
amazed was the little half-breed at Cameron's quite unusual display of
oratorical power that his own imagination took fire and his own tongue
was loosened to such an extent that by voice, look, tone and gesture he
poured into his officer's harangue a force and fervor all his own."And now," continued Cameron, "this vain and foolish Frenchman seeks
again to lead you astray, to lead you into war that will bring ruin
to you and to your children; and this lying snake from your ancient
enemies, the Sioux, thinking you are foolish children, seeks to make
you fight against the great White Mother across the seas.He has been
talking like a babbling old man, from whom the years have taken wisdom,
when he says that the half-breeds and Indians can drive the white man
from these plains.Has he told you how many are the children of the
White Mother, how many are the soldiers in her army?Get me many branches from the trees," he commanded sharply to some
young Indians standing near.So completely were the Indians under the thrall of his speech that a
dozen of them sprang at once to get branches from the poplar trees near
by."I will show you," said Cameron, "how many are the White Mother's
soldiers.See,"--he held up both hands and then stuck up a small twig in
the sand to indicate the number ten.Ten of these small twigs he set in
a row and by a larger stick indicated a hundred, and so on till he had
set forth in the sandy soil a diagrammatic representation of a hundred
thousand men, the Indians following closely his every movement."And all
these men," he continued, "are armed with rifles and with great big guns
that speak like thunder.And these are only a few of the White Mother's
soldiers.How many Indians and half-breeds do you think there are with
rifles?"He set in a row sticks to represent a thousand men."See," he
cried, "so many.""Perhaps, if all
the Indians gathered, so many with rifles.Now look," he said,
"no big guns, only a few bullets, a little powder, a little food.My Indian brothers here will not listen to him, but
there are others whose hearts are like the hearts of little children who
may listen to his lying words.The Sioux snake must be caught and put in
a cage, and this I do now."As he uttered the words Cameron sprang for the Sioux, but quicker than
his leap the Sioux darted through the crowding Indians who, perceiving
Cameron's intent, thrust themselves in his path and enabled the Sioux to
get away into the brush behind."Head him off, Jerry," yelled Cameron, whistling sharply at the same
time for his men, while he darted for his horse and threw himself upon
it.The whole camp was in a seething uproar.The Indians fell away from him
like waves from a speeding vessel.On the other side of the little bluff
he caught sight of a mounted Indian flying toward the mountains and with
a cry he started in pursuit.It took only a few minutes for Cameron to
discover that he was gaining rapidly upon his man.But the rough rocky
country was not far away in front of them, and here was abundant chance
for hiding.Closer and closer he drew to his flying enemy--a hundred
yards--seventy-five yards--fifty yards only separated them.But the Indian, throwing himself on the far side of his pony, urged him
to his topmost speed.Cameron steadied himself for a moment, took careful aim and fired.The
flying pony stumbled, recovered himself, stumbled again and fell.But
even before he reached the earth his rider had leaped free, and, still
some thirty yards in advance, sped onward.Half a dozen strides and
Cameron's horse was upon him, and, giving him the shoulder, hurled the
Indian senseless to earth.In a flash Cameron was at his side, turned
him over and discovered not the Sioux Chief but another Indian quite
unknown to him.His rage and disappointment were almost beyond his control.For an
instant he held his gun poised as if to strike, but the blow did not
fall.He put up his gun, turned quickly
away from the prostrate Indian, flung himself upon his horse and set off
swiftly for the camp.It was but a mile distant, but in the brief
time consumed in reaching it he had made up his mind as to his line of
action.Unless his men had captured the Sioux it was almost certain that
he had made his escape to the canyon, and once in the canyon there was
little hope of his being taken.It was of the first importance that he
should not appear too deeply concerned over his failure to take his man.With this thought in his mind Cameron loped easily into the Indian camp.He found the young braves in a state of feverish excitement.Armed with
guns and clubs, they gathered about their Chiefs clamoring to be allowed
to wipe out these representatives of the Police who had dared to attempt
an arrest of this distinguished guest of theirs.As Cameron appeared
the uproar quieted somewhat and the Indians gathered about him, eagerly
waiting his next move.Cameron cantered up to Running Stream and, looking round upon the
crowding and excited braves, he said, with a smile of cool indifference:

"The Sioux snake has slid away in the grass.After he has eaten we will have
some quiet talk."So saying, he swung himself from his saddle, drew the reins over his
horse's ears and, throwing himself down beside a camp fire, he pulled
out his pipe and proceeded to light it as calmly as if sitting in a
council-lodge.Nothing appeals more strongly
to the Indian than an exhibition of steady nerve.For some moments they
stood regarding Cameron with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration
with a strong admixture of impatience, for they had thought of being
done out of their great powwow with its attendant joys of dance and
feast, and if this Policeman should choose to remain with them all day
there could certainly be neither dancing nor feasting for them.In the
meantime, however, there was nothing for it but to accept the situation
created for them.This cool-headed Mounted Policeman had planted himself
by their camp-fire.They could not very well drive him from their camp,
nor could they converse with him till he was ready.As they were thus standing about in uncertainty of mind and temper
Jerry, the interpreter, came in and, with a grunt of recognition, threw
himself down by Cameron beside the fire.After some further hesitation
the Indians began to busy themselves once more with their breakfast.In
the group about the campfire beside which Cameron had placed himself was
the Chief, Running Stream.The presence of the Policeman beside his fire
was most embarrassing to the Chief, for no man living has a keener sense
of the obligations of hospitality than has the Indian.But the Indian
hates to eat in the presence of a white man unless the white man shares
his meal.Hence Running Stream approached Cameron with a courteous
request that he would eat with them."Thanks, Running Stream, I have eaten, but I am sure Jerry here will
be glad of some breakfast," said Cameron cordially, who had no desire
whatever to dip out of the very doubtful mess in the pot which had been
set down on the ground in the midst of the group around the fire.Jerry, however, had no scruples in the matter and, like every Indian
and half-breed, was always ready for a meal.Having thus been offered
hospitality and having by proxy accepted it, Cameron was in position to
discuss with the Chief in a judicial if not friendly spirit the matter
he had in hand.Breakfast over, Cameron offered his tobacco-pouch to the Chief, who,
gravely helping himself to a pipeful, passed it on to his neighbor who,
having done likewise, passed it in turn to the man next him till the
tobacco was finished and the empty pouch returned with due gravity to
the owner.Relations of friendly diplomacy being thus established, the whole party
sat smoking in solemn silence until the pipes were smoked out.Then
Cameron, knocking the ashes from his pipe, opened up the matter in hand,
with Jerry interpreting."The Sioux snake," he began quietly, "will be hungry for his breakfast."Huh," grunted Running Stream, non-committal."The Police will get him in due time," continued Cameron in a tone of
quiet indifference."He will cease to trouble our Indian brothers with
foolish lies.The prison gates are strong and will soon close upon this
stranger with the forked tongue."Again the Chief grunted, still non-committal."It would be a pity if any of your young men should give heed to these
silly tales.In the Sioux country
there is frequent war between the soldiers and the Indians because bad
men wish to wrong the Indians and the Indians grow angry and fight, but
in this country white men are punished who do wrong to Indians."Huh," grunted Running Stream acquiescing."When Indians do wrong to white men it is just that the Indians should
be punished as well.The Police do justly between the white man and the
Indian."Huh," again grunted Running Stream with an uneasy look on his face."Therefore when young and foolish braves steal and kill cattle they must
be punished.Here Cameron's voice
grew gentle as a child's, but there was in its tone something that made
the Chief glance quickly at his face."Huh, my young men no steal cattle," he said sullenly.I believe that is true, and that is why I
smoke with my brother beside his camp fire.But some young men in this
band have stolen cattle, and I want my brother to find them that I might
take them with me to the Commissioner.""Not know any Indian take cattle," said Running Stream in surly
defiance."There are four skins and four heads lying in the bluff up yonder,
Running Stream.I am going to take those with me to the Commissioner and
I am sure he would like to see you about those skins."Cameron's manner
continued to be mild but there ran through his speech an undertone of
stern resolution that made the Indian squirm a bit."Not know any Indian take cattle," repeated Running Stream, but with
less defiance."Then it would be well for my brother to find out the thieves, for," and
here Cameron paused and looked the Chief steadily in the face for a few
moments, "for we are to take them back with us or we will ask the Chief
to come and explain to the Commissioner why he does not know what his
young men are doing.""No Blackfeet Indian take cattle," said the Chief once more."Then it must be the Bloods, or the Piegans or the
Stonies.He had determined to spend
the day if necessary in running down these thieves.At his suggestion
Running Stream called together the Chiefs of the various bands of
Indians represented.From his supplies Cameron drew forth some more
tobacco and, passing it round the circle of Chiefs, calmly waited until
all had smoked their pipes out, after which he proceeded to lay the case
before them.The Police believe them to be honest
men, but unfortunately among them there have crept in some who are not
honest.In the bluff yonder are four hides and four heads of steers, two
of them from my own herd.Some bad Indians have stolen and killed these
steers and they are here in this camp to-day, and I am going to take
them with me to the Commissioner.Running Stream is a great Chief and
speaks no lies and he tells me that none of his young men have taken
these cattle.Will the Chief of the Stonies, the Chief of the Bloods,
the Chief of the Piegans say the same for their young men?""The Stonies take no cattle," answered an Indian whom Cameron recognized
as the leading representative of that tribe present.What about the Bloods and the Piegans?""It is not for me," he continued, when there was no reply, "to discover
the cattle-thieves.It is for the Big Chief of this camp, it is for you,
Running Stream, and when you have found the thieves I shall arrest them
and bring them to the Commissioner, for I will not return without them.Meantime I go to bring here the skins."So saying, Cameron rode leisurely away, leaving Jerry to keep an eye
upon the camp.For more than an hour they talked among themselves, but
without result.Finally they came to Jerry, who, during his years
with the Police, had to a singular degree gained the confidence of the
Indians.There had been much stealing
of cattle by some of the tribes, not by all.The Police had been
patient, but they had become weary.They had their suspicions as to the
thieves.Eagle Feather was anxious to know what Indians were suspected."Not the Stonies and not the Blackfeet," replied Jerry quietly.It was
a pity, he continued, that innocent men should suffer for the guilty.He
knew Running Stream was no thief, but Running Stream must find out the
thieves in the band under his control.How would Running Stream like to
have the great Chief of the Blackfeet, Crowfoot, know that he could not
control the young men under his command and did not know what they were
doing?This suggestion of Jerry had a mighty effect upon the Blackfeet Chief,
for old Crowfoot was indeed a great Chief and a mighty power with his
band, and to fall into disfavor with him would be a serious matter for
any junior Chief in the tribe.Again they withdrew for further discussion and soon it became evident
that Jerry's cunning suggestions had sown seeds of discord among them.The dispute waxed hot and fierce, not as to the guilty parties, who were
apparently acknowledged to be the Piegans, but as to the course to be
pursued.Running Stream had no intention that his people and himself
should become involved in the consequences of the crimes of other
tribes whom the Blackfeet counted their inferiors.Eagle Feather and his
Piegans must bear the consequences of their own misdeeds.On the other
hand Eagle Feather pleaded hard that they should stand together in this
matter, that the guilty parties could not be disclosed.The Police could
not punish them all, and all the more necessary was it that they should
hold together because of the larger enterprise into which they were
about to enter.The absence of the Sioux Chief Onawata, however, weakened the bond of
unity which he more than any other had created and damped the ardor of
the less eager of the conspirators.It was likewise a serious blow to
their hopes of success that the Police knew all their plans.Running
Stream finally gave forth his decision, which was that the thieves
should be given up, and that they all should join in a humble petition
to the Police for leniency, pleading the necessity of hunger on their
hunting-trip, and, as for the larger enterprise, that they should
apparently abandon it until suspicion had been allayed and until the
plans of their brothers in the North were more nearly matured.The time
for striking had not yet come.In this decision all but the Piegans agreed.In vain Eagle Feather
contended that they should stand together and defy the Police to prove
any of them guilty.In vain he sought to point out that if in this
crisis they surrendered the Piegans to the Police never again could they
count upon the Piegans to support them in any enterprise.But Running
Stream and the others were resolved.At the very moment in which this decision had been reached Cameron rode
in, carrying with him the incriminating hides."You take charge of these and bring them to the
Commissioner.""All right," said Jerry, taking the hides from Cameron's horse.said Cameron in a low voice as the half-breed was
untying the bundle.Quietly Cameron walked over to the group of excited Indians.As he
approached they opened their circle to receive him."My brother has discovered the thief," he said."And after all a thief
is easily found among honest men."Slowly and deliberately his eye traveled round the circle of faces,
keenly scrutinizing each in turn.When he came to Eagle Feather he
paused, gazed fixedly at him, took a single step in his direction, and,
suddenly leveling an accusing finger at him, cried in a loud voice:

"I have found him.Slowly he walked up to the Indian, who remained stoically motionless,
laid his hand upon his wrist and said in a clear ringing voice heard
over the encampment:

"Eagle Feather, I arrest you in the name of the Queen!"And before
another word could be spoken or a movement made Eagle Feather stood
handcuffed, a prisoner.CHAPTER XIV

"GOOD MAN--GOOD SQUAW"


"That boy is worse, Mrs.Cameron, decidedly worse, and I wash my hands
of all responsibility."Mandy sat silent, weary with watching and weary with the conflict that
had gone on intermittently during the past three days.The doctor
was determined to have the gangrenous foot off.That was the simplest
solution of the problem before him and the foot would have come off days
ago if he had had his way.But the Indian boy had vehemently opposed
this proposal."One foot--me go die," was his ultimatum, and through
all the fever and delirium this was his continuous refrain.In this
determination his nurse supported him, for she could not bring herself
to the conviction that amputation was absolutely necessary, and,
besides, of all the melancholy and useless driftwood that drives hither
and thither with the ebb and flow of human life, she could imagine none
more melancholy and more useless than an Indian crippled of a foot.Hence she supported the boy in his ultimatum, "One foot--me go die.""That foot ought to come off," repeated the doctor, beginning the
controversy anew."But, doctor," said Mandy wearily, "just think how pitiable, how
helpless that boy will be.And, besides, I have not
quite given up hope that--"

The doctor snorted his contempt for her opinion; and only his respect
for her as Cameron's wife and for the truly extraordinary powers and
gifts in her profession which she had displayed during the past three
days held back the wrathful words that were at his lips.It was late in
the afternoon and the doctor had given many hours to this case, riding
back and forward from the fort every day, but all this he would not have
grudged could he have had his way with his patient."Well, I have done my best," he said, "and now I must go back to my
work.""I know, doctor, I know," pleaded Mandy."You have been most kind and
I thank you from my heart.""Don't
think me too awfully obstinate, and please forgive me if you do."The doctor took the outstretched hand grudgingly."Of all the obstinate creatures--"

"Oh, I am afraid I am.You see, the
boy is so splendidly plucky and such a fine chap.""He is a fine chap, doctor, and I can't bear to have him crippled,
and--" She paused abruptly, her lips beginning to quiver.She was near
the limit of her endurance."You would rather have him dead, eh?All right, if that suits you better
it makes no difference to me," said the doctor gruffly, picking up his
bag."Doctor, you will come back again to-morrow?"I can do no more--unless
you agree to amputation.There is no use coming back to-morrow.I can't give all my time to this Indian."The
contempt in the doctor's voice for a mere Indian stung her like a whip.On Mandy's cheek, pale with her long vigil, a red flush appeared and
in her eye a light that would have warned the doctor had he known her
better.But the doctor was very impatient and anxious to be gone.Yes, of course, a human being, but there are human
beings and human beings.But if you mean an Indian is as good as a white
man, frankly I don't agree with you.""You have given a great deal of your time, doctor," said Mandy with
quiet deliberation, "and I am most grateful.I can ask no more for THIS
INDIAN.I only regret that I have been forced to ask so much of your
time.There was a ring as of steel in her voice.John went to the hallway.The doctor
became at once apologetic."What--eh?--I beg your pardon," he stammered.I don't quite--"

"Good-by, doctor, and again thank you.""Well, you know quite well I can't do any more," said the old doctor
crossly."No, I don't think you can."And awkwardly the doctor walked away,
rather uncertain as to her meaning but with a feeling that he had been
dismissed.he muttered as he left the tent door,
indignant with himself that no fitting reply would come to his lips.And
not until he had mounted his horse and taken the trail was he able to
give full and adequate expression to his feelings, and even then it
took him some considerable time to do full justice to himself and to the
situation.Meantime the nurse had turned back to her watch, weary and despairing.In a way that she could not herself understand the Indian boy had
awakened her interest and even her affection.His fine stoical courage,
his warm and impulsive gratitude excited her admiration and touched her
heart.Again arose to her lips a cry that had been like a refrain in her
heart for the past three days, "Oh, if only Dr.Martin had made it only too apparent
that the old army surgeon was archaic in his practice and method.she said aloud, as she bent over her
patient.As if in answer to her cry there was outside a sound of galloping
horses.She ran to the tent door and before her astonished eyes there
drew up at her tent Dr.Martin, her sister-in-law and the ever-faithful
Smith.she cried, running to him with both hands
outstretched, and could say no more.Say, what the deuce have they been doing to you?""Oh, I am glad, that's all."Well, you show your joy in a mighty queer way.""She's done out, Doctor," cried Moira, springing from her horse and
running to her sister-in-law."I ought to have come before to relieve
her," she continued penitently, with her arms round Mandy, "but I knew
so little, and besides I thought the doctor was here.""He was here," said Mandy, recovering herself."He has just gone, and
oh, I am glad.How did you get here in all the world?""Your telegram came when I was away," said the doctor."I did not get it
for a day, then I came at once."I have it here--no, I've left it somewhere--but I
certainly got a telegram from you."Martin's presence, and--I ventured to send a wire in your name.I hope
you will forgive the liberty," said Smith, red to his hair-roots and
looking over his horse's neck with a most apologetic air.Smith, you are
my guardian angel," running to him and shaking him warmly by the hand."And he brought, us here, too," cried Moira."He has been awfully good
to me these days.I do not know what I should have done without him."Meantime Smith was standing first on one foot and then on the other in a
most unhappy state of mind."Guess I will be going back," he said in an agony of awkwardness and
confusion."I've got some chores to look after, and I guess none of you are coming
back now anyway.""Well, hold on a bit," said the doctor."Guess you don't need me any more," continued Smith.And he
climbed on to his horse.No one appeared to have any good reason why Smith should remain, and so
he rode away."You have really
saved my life, I assure you.Smith," cried Moira, waving her hand with a bright smile."You have saved me too from dying many a time these three days."With an awkward wave Smith answered these farewells and rode down the
trail."He is really a fine fellow," said Mandy."That is just it," cried Moira."He has spent his whole time these three
days doing things for me.""Ah, no wonder," said the doctor.John went back to the kitchen.But what's the
trouble here?Mandy gave him a detailed history of the case, the doctor meanwhile
making an examination of the patient's general condition."And the doctor would have his foot off, but I would not stand for
that," cried Mandy indignantly as she closed her history.Looks bad enough to come off, I should say.I wish I had been here
a couple of days ago."I don't know what the outcome may be, but it
looks as bad as it well can.""Oh, that's all right," cried Mandy cheerfully."I knew it would be all
right."Mary moved to the bathroom."Well, whether it will or not I cannot say.But one thing I do know,
you've got to trot off to sleep.Show me the ropes and then off you go."Oh, the Chief does, Chief Trotting Wolf.And she ran from the tent
to find the Chief.But she is played right out I can see,"
replied the doctor."I must get comfortable quarters for you both."echoed the doctor, looking at her as she stood in the
glow of the westering sun shining through the canvas tent."Well, you can just bet that
is just what I do want."A slight flush appeared on the girl's face."I mean," she said hurriedly, "cannot I be of some help?""Most certainly, most certainly," said the doctor, noting the flush."Your help will be invaluable after a bit.She has been on this job, I understand, for three
days.I am quite ready to take my
sister-in-law's place, that is, as far as I can.And you will surely
need some one--to help you I mean."The doctor's eyes were upon her
face.The glow of the sunset through
the tent walls illumined her face with a wonderful radiance."Miss Moira," said the doctor with abrupt vehemence, "I wish I had the
nerve to tell you just how much--"

"Hush!"cried the girl, her glowing face suddenly pale, "they are
coming."Martin," cried Mandy, ushering in that stately
individual.The doctor saluted the Chief in due form and said:

"Could we have another tent, Chief, for these ladies?Just beside this
tent here, so that they can have a little sleep."The Chief grunted a doubtful acquiescence, but in due time a tent very
much dilapidated was pitched upon the clean dry ground close beside
that in which the sick boy lay.While this was being done the doctor was
making a further examination of his patient.With admiring eyes,
Moira followed the swift movements of his deft fingers.There was the sure indication
of accurate knowledge, the obvious self-confidence of experience in
everything he did.Even to her untutored eyes the doctor seemed to be
walking with a very firm tread.At length, after an hour's work, he turned to Mandy who was assisting
him and said:

"Now you can both go to sleep."You will be sure to call me if I can be of service," said Mandy.I shall look after
this end of the job.""He is very sure of himself, is he not?"said Moira in a low tone to her
sister-in-law as they passed out of the tent."He has a right to be," said Mandy proudly."He knows his work, and now
I feel as if I can sleep in peace.What a blessed thing sleep is," she
added, as, without undressing, she tumbled on to the couch prepared for
her.Well, rather--" Her voice was trailing off again into slumber.Knows his work if that's what you mean.Oh-h--but I'm
sleepy."That
is, he is a man all through right to his toe-tips.And gentle--more
gentle than any woman I ever saw.And before
Moira could make reply she was sound asleep.Before the night was over the opportunity was given the doctor to
prove his manhood, and in a truly spectacular manner.For shortly
after midnight Moira found herself sitting bolt upright, wide-awake and
clutching her sister-in-law in wild terror.Outside their tent the night
was hideous with discordant noises, yells, whoops, cries, mingled with
the beating of tom-toms.Terrified and trembling, the two girls sprang
to the door, and, lifting the flap, peered out.It was the party of
braves returning from the great powwow so rudely interrupted by Cameron.They were returning in an evil mood, too, for they were enraged at the
arrest of Eagle Feather and three accomplices in his crime, disappointed
in the interruption of their sun dance and its attendant joys of feast
and song, and furious at what appeared to them to be the overthrow of
the great adventure for which they had been preparing and planning for
the past two months.This was indeed the chief cause of their rage, for
it seemed as if all further attempts at united effort among the Western
tribes had been frustrated by the discovery of their plans, by the
flight of their leader, and by the treachery of the Blackfeet Chief,
Running Stream, in surrendering their fellow-tribesmen to the Police.To them that treachery rendered impossible any coalition between the
Piegans and the Blackfeet.Furthermore, before their powwow had been
broken up there had been distributed among them a few bottles of
whisky provided beforehand by the astute Sioux as a stimulus to their
enthusiasm against a moment of crisis when such stimulus should be
necessary.These bottles, in the absence of their great leader, were
distributed among the tribes by Running Stream as a peace-offering, but
for obvious reason not until the moment came for their parting from each
other.Filled with rage and disappointment, and maddened with the bad whisky
they had taken, they poured into the encampment with wild shouting
accompanied by the discharge of guns and the beating of drums.In terror
the girls clung to each other, gazing out upon the horrid scene.But her sister-in-law could give her little explanation.The moonlight,
glowing bright as day, revealed a truly terrifying spectacle.A band
of Indians, almost naked and hideously painted, were leaping, shouting,
beating drums and firing guns.Out from the tents poured the rest of the
band to meet them, eagerly inquiring into the cause of their excitement.Soon fires were lighted and kettles put on, for the Indian's happiness
is never complete unless associated with feasting, and the whole band
prepared itself for a time of revelry.As the girls stood peering out upon this terrible scene they became
aware of the doctor standing at their side."Say, they seem to be cutting up rather rough, don't they?""I think as a precautionary measure you had better step over
into the other tent."Hastily gathering their belongings, they ran across with the doctor to
his tent, from which they continued to gaze upon the weird spectacle
before them.About the largest fire in the center of the camp the crowd gathered,
Chief Trotting Wolf in the midst, and were harangued by one of
the returning braves who was evidently reciting the story of their
experiences and whose tale was received with the deepest interest and
was punctuated by mad cries and whoops.The one English word that could
be heard was the word "Police," and it needed no interpreter to
explain to the watchers that the chief object of fury to the crowding,
gesticulating Indians about the fire was the Policeman who had been the
cause of their humiliation and disappointment.In a pause of the uproar
a loud exclamation from an Indian arrested the attention of the band.Once more he uttered his exclamation and pointed to the tent lately
occupied by the ladies.Quickly the whole band about the fire appeared
to bunch together preparatory to rush in the direction indicated, but
before they could spring forward Trotting Wolf, speaking rapidly and
with violent gesticulation, stood in their path.He was thrust aside and the whole band came rushing madly
toward the tent lately occupied by the ladies."Get back from the door," said the doctor, speaking rapidly."These
chaps seem to be somewhat excited.I wish I had my gun," he continued,
looking about the tent for a weapon of some sort."This will do," he
said, picking up a stout poplar pole that had been used for driving the
tent pegs."But they will kill you," cried Moira, laying her hand upon his arm.I'll
knock some of their blocks off first."So saying, he lifted the flap of
the tent and passed out just as the rush of maddened Indians came.Upon the ladies' tent they fell, kicked the tent poles down, and,
seizing the canvas ripped it clear from its pegs.Some moments they
spent searching the empty bed, then turned with renewed cries toward the
other tent before which stood the doctor, waiting, grim, silent, savage.For a single moment they paused, arrested by the silent figure, then
with a whoop a drink-maddened brave sprang toward the tent, his rifle
clubbed to strike.Before he could deliver his blow the doctor, stepping
swiftly to one side, swung his poplar club hard upon the uplifted arms,
sent the rifle crashing to the ground and with a backward swing caught
the astonished brave on the exposed head and dropped him to the earth as
if dead.he
shouted, swinging his club as a player might a baseball bat.Before the next rush, however, help came in an unexpected form.The tent
flap was pushed back and at the doctor's side stood an apparition that
checked the Indians' advance and stilled their cries.It was the Indian
boy, clad in a white night robe of Mandy's providing, his rifle in his
hand, his face ghastly in the moonlight and his eyes burning like flames
of light.One cry he uttered, weird, fierce, unearthly, but it seemed
to pierce like a knife through the stillness that had fallen.Awed,
sobered, paralyzed, the Indians stood motionless.Then from their ranks
ran Chief Trotting Wolf, picked up the rifle of the Indian who still lay
insensible on the ground, and took his place beside the boy.A few words he spoke in a voice that rang out fiercely imperious.Again the Chief spoke in short, sharp
words of command, and, as they still hesitated, took one swift stride
toward the man that stood nearest, swinging his rifle over his head.Forward sprang the doctor to his side, his poplar club likewise swung up
to strike.Back fell the Indians a pace or two, the Chief following them
with a torrential flow of vehement invective.Slowly, sullenly the crowd
gave back, cowed but still wrathful, and beginning to mutter in angry
undertones.Once more the tent flap was pushed aside and there issued
two figures who ran to the side of the Indian boy, now swaying weakly
upon his rifle.cried Mandy, throwing her arms round about him, and,
steadying him as he let his rifle fall, let him sink slowly to the
ground.cried Moira, seizing the rifle that the boy had dropped
and springing to the doctor's side.She
turned and pointed indignantly to the swooning boy.With an exclamation of wrath the doctor stepped back to Mandy's aid,
forgetful of the threatening Indians and mindful only of his patient.Quickly he sprang into the tent, returning with a stimulating remedy,
bent over the boy and worked with him till he came back again to life.Once more the Chief, who with the Indians had been gazing upon this
scene, turned and spoke to his band, this time in tones of quiet
dignity, pointing to the little group behind him.Silent and subdued the
Indians listened, their quick impulses like those of children stirred
to sympathy for the lad and for those who would aid him.Gradually the
crowd drew off, separating into groups and gathering about the various
fires.Martin and the Chief carried the boy into the tent and
laid him on his bed."What sort of beasts have you got out there anyway?"said the doctor,
facing the Chief abruptly."Him drink bad whisky," answered the Chief, tipping up his hand."Him
crazee," touching his head with his forefinger.What they want is a few ounces of lead."The Chief made no reply, but stood with his eyes turned admiringly upon
Moira's face."Squaw--him good," he said, pointing to the girl."No 'fraid--much
brave--good.""You are right enough there, Chief," replied the doctor heartily.inquired the Chief, pointing to Moira.No, not exactly," replied the doctor, much confused, "that
is--not yet I mean--"

"Huh!Him good man," replied the Chief, pointing first
to Moira, then to the doctor.replied the Chief, moving out past her."Him drink, him
crazee--no drink, no crazee."Mary travelled to the hallway.At the door he paused, and, looking back,
said once more with increased emphasis, "Huh!Him good squaw," and
finally disappeared."The old boy is a
man of some discernment I can see.But the kid and you saved the day,
Miss Moira."It was truly awful, and how
splendidly you--you--"

"Well, I caught him rather a neat one, I confess.I wonder if the brute
is sleeping yet.But you did the trick finally, Miss Moira.""Huh," grunted Mandy derisively, "Good man--good squaw, eh?"CHAPTER XV

THE OUTLAW


The bitter weather following an autumn of unusual mildness had set in
with the New Year and had continued without a break for fifteen days.A
heavy fall of snow with a blizzard blowing sixty miles an hour had made
the trails almost impassable, indeed quite so to any but to those bent
on desperate business or to Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police.To
these gallant riders all trails stood open at all seasons of the year,
no matter what snow might fall or blizzard blow, so long as duty called
them forth.The trail from the fort to the Big Horn Ranch, however, was so
wind-swept that the snow was blown away, which made the going fairly
easy, and the Superintendent, Inspector Dickson and Jerry trotted along
freely enough in the face of a keen southwester that cut to the bone.It was surely some desperate business indeed that sent them out into
the face of that cutting wind which made even these hardy riders, burned
hard and dry by scorching suns and biting blizzards, wince and shelter
their faces with their gauntleted hands."It is the raw southwester that gets to the bone," replied Inspector
Dickson."This will blow up a chinook before night.""I wonder if he has got into shelter," said the Superintendent."This
has been an unusually hard fortnight, and I am afraid he went rather
light.""Oh, he's sure to be all right," replied the Inspector quickly."He was
riding, but he took his snowshoes with him for timber work.He's hardly
the man to get caught and he won't quit easily.""No, he won't quit, but there are times when human endurance fails.Not
that I fear anything like that for Cameron," added the Superintendent
hastily."Oh, he's not the man to fall down," replied the Inspector."He goes the
limit, but he keeps his head."Well, you ought to know him," said the Superintendent."You have been
through some things together, but this last week has been about the
worst that I have known.This fortnight will be remembered in the annals
of this country.What do you think about
it, Jerry?"continued the Superintendent, turning to the half-breed."He good man--cold ver' bad--ver' long.S'pose catch heem on
plains--ver' bad."The Inspector touched his horse to a canter.The vision that floated
before his mind's eye while the half-breed was speaking he hated to
contemplate.He has come through too many tight places to fail
here," said the Inspector in a tone almost of defiance, and refused to
talk further upon the subject.But he kept urging the pace till they
drew up at the stables of the Big Horn Ranch.The Inspector's first glance upon opening the stable door swept the
stall where Ginger was wont to conduct his melancholy ruminations.It
gave him a start to see the stall empty.he cried as that individual appeared with a bundle of
hay from the stack in the yard outside.inquired the Superintendent in the same
breath, and in spite of himself a note of anxiety had crept into his
voice.The three men stood waiting, their tense attitude expressing the
anxiety they would not put into words.The deliberate Smith, who had
transferred his services from old Thatcher to Cameron and who had taken
the ranch and all persons and things belonging to it into his immediate
charge, disposed of his bundle in a stall, and then facing them said
slowly:

"Guess he's all right."Gone to bed, I think," answered Smith with
maddening calmness.The Inspector cursed him between his teeth and turned away from the
others till his eyes should be clear again.Cameron for a few minutes," said the
Superintendent.Leaving Jerry to put up their horses, they went into the ranch-house and
found the ladies in a state of suppressed excitement.Mandy met them at
the door with an eager welcome, holding out to them trembling hands."Oh, I am so glad you have come!""It was all I could do
to hold him back from going to you even as he was.He was quite set on
going and only lay down on promise that I should wake him in an hour.An hour, mind you," she continued, talking
rapidly and under obvious excitement, "and him so blind and exhausted
that--" She paused abruptly, unable to command her voice."He ought to sleep twelve hours straight," said the Superintendent with
emphasis, "and twenty-four would be better, with suitable breaks for
refreshment," he added in a lighter tone, glancing at Mandy's face."Yes, indeed," she replied, "for he has had little enough to eat the
last three days.And that reminds me--" she hurried to the pantry and
returned with the teapot--"you must be cold, Superintendent.A hot cup of tea will be just the thing.It will take
only five minutes--and it is better than punch, though perhaps you men
do not think so."Cameron," said the Superintendent in a shocked, bantering
voice, "how can you imagine we should be guilty of such heresy--in this
prohibition country, too?""Oh, I know you men," replied Mandy."We keep some Scotch in the
house--beside the laudanum.Some people can't take tea, you know," she
added with an uncertain smile, struggling to regain control of herself."But all the same, I am a nurse, and I know that after exposure tea is
better.""Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I bow to your experience,"
making a brave attempt to meet her mood and declining to note her
unusual excitement.In the specified five minutes the tea was ready."I could quite accept your tea-drinking theory, Mrs.Cameron," said
Inspector Dickson, "if--if, mark you--I should always get such tea as
this.But I don't believe Jerry here would agree."Jerry, who had just entered, stood waiting explanation.Cameron has just been upholding the virtue of a good cup of tea,
Jerry, over a hot Scotch after a cold ride.A slight grin wrinkled the cracks in Jerry's leather-skin face."Hot whisky--good for fun--for cold no good.Whisky good for sleep--for
long trail no good.""Thank you, Jerry," cried Mandy enthusiastically."Oh, that's all right, Jerry," said the Inspector, joining in the
general laugh that followed, "but I don't think Miss Moira here would
agree with you in regard to the merits of her national beverage.""Oh, I am not so sure," cried the young lady, entering into the mood
of the others."Of course, I am Scotch and naturally stand up for my
country and for its customs, but, to be strictly honest, I remember
hearing my brother say that Scotch was bad training for football.""You see, when anything serious is on, the
wisest people cut out the Scotch, as the boys say."Cameron," said the Superintendent, becoming
grave."On the long trail and in the bitter cold we drop the Scotch and
bank on tea.As for whisky, the Lord knows it gives the Police enough
trouble in this country.If it were not for the whisky half our work
would be cut out.he added, as he
handed back his cup for another supply of tea."Done up, or more nearly done up than ever I have seen him, or than I
ever want to see him again."Mandy paused abruptly, handed him his
cup of tea, passed into the pantry and for some moments did not appear
again."Oh, it was terrible to see him," said Moira, clasping her hands and
speaking in an eager, excited voice."He came, poor boy, stumbling
toward the door.He had to leave his horse, you know, some miles away.Through the window we saw him coming along--and we did not know him--he
staggered as if--as if--actually as if he were drunk.""And he could not find the latch--and when we opened
the door his eyes were--oh!--so terrible!--wild--and bloodshot--and
blind!she exclaimed, her voice
breaking and her tears falling fast.We had to cut off his snow-shoes--and his gauntlets and his clothes
were like iron.He could not sit down--he just--just--lay on the
floor--till--my sister--" Here the girl's sobs interrupted her story.The Inspector had risen and came round to Moira's side."Don't try to tell me any more," he said in a husky voice, patting her
gently on the shoulder."He is here with us, safe, poor chap.he cried in an undertone, "what he must have gone through!"At this point Mandy returned and took her place again quietly by the
fire."It was this sudden spell of cold that nearly killed him," she said in a
quiet voice."He was not fully prepared for it, and it caught him at
the end of his trip, too, when he was nearly played out.You see, he was
five weeks away and he had only expected to be three.""I don't know what it was," replied Mandy."He could tell me little, but
he was determined to go on to the fort.""I know something about his plans," said the Inspector."He had proposed
a tour of the reserves, beginning with the Piegans and ending with the
Bloods.""And we know something of his work, too, Mrs."Superintendent Strong has sent us a very fine report
indeed of your husband's work.We do not talk about these things,
you know, in the Police, but we can appreciate them all the same.Superintendent Strong's letter is one you would like to keep.Knowing Superintendent Strong as I do--"

"I know him too," said Mandy with a little laugh."Well, then, you will be able to appreciate all the more any word of
commendation he would utter.He practically attributes the present state
of quiet and the apparent collapse of this conspiracy business to
your husband's efforts.This, of course, is no compensation for his
sufferings or yours, but I think it right that you should know the
facts."The Superintendent had risen to his feet and had delivered his
little speech in his very finest manner."We had expected him back a week ago," said the Inspector."We know he
must have had some serious cause for delay.""I do not know about that," replied Mandy, "but I do know he was most
anxious to go on to the fort.He had some information to give, he said,
which was of the first importance.He will
be saved that trip, which would really be dangerous in his present
condition.And I don't believe I could have stopped him, but I should
have gone with him."Don't think of waking him," said the Superintendent."We can wait two
hours, or three hours, or more if necessary.Sandra journeyed to the hallway."He would waken himself if he were not so fearfully done up.He has a
trick of waking at any hour he sets," said Mandy.A few minutes later Cameron justified her remarks by appearing from
the inner room.The men, accustomed as they were to the ravages of
the winter trail upon their comrades, started to their feet in horror.Blindly Cameron felt his way to them, shading his blood-shot eyes from
the light.His face was blistered and peeled as if he had come through a
fire, his lips swollen and distorted, his hands trembling and showing
on every finger the marks of frost bite, and his feet dragging as he
shuffled across the floor."My dear fellow, my dear fellow," cried the Inspector, springing up to
meet him and grasping him by both arms to lead him to a chair."You ran
it too close that time.Sit
down, old man, sit down right here."The Inspector deposited him in the
chair, and, striding hurriedly to the window, stood there looking out
upon the bleak winter snow."Hello, Cameron," said the Superintendent, shaking him by the hand with
hearty cheerfulness."Glad, awfully glad to see you.Fine bit of work,
very fine bit of work."I don't know what you refer to, sir," said Cameron, speaking thickly,
"but I am glad you are here, for I have an important communication to
make.""Oh, that's all right," said the Superintendent.Snow-blind, I see," he continued, critically examining him, "and
generally used up.""Rather knocked up," replied Cameron, his tongue refusing to move with
its accustomed ease."But shall be fit in a day or two.Beastly sleepy,
but cannot sleep somehow.Shall feel better when my mind is at rest."Superintendent Strong has sent us in a report, and a very creditable
report, too.""Well, the thing I want to say is
that though all looks quiet--there is less horse stealing this month,
and less moving about from the reserves--yet I believe a serious
outbreak is impending."The Inspector, who had come around and taken a seat beside him, touched
his knee at this point with an admonishing pressure.You
need not have any fear about them."A little smile distorted his face as
he laid his hand upon his wife's shoulder.He was as a man feeling his way through a maze."Oh, let it go," said the Inspector."Wait till you have had some
sleep.""No, I must--I must get this out.Well, anyway, the principal thing
is that Big Bear, Beardy, Poundmaker--though I am not sure about
Poundmaker--have runners on every reserve and they are arranging for
a big meeting in the spring, to which every tribe North and West is to
send representatives.That Frenchman--what's his name?--I'll forget my
own next--"

"Riel?"That Frenchman is planning a big coup in the spring.You
know they presented him with a house the other day, ready furnished, at
Batoche, to keep him in the country.Oh, the half-breeds are very keen
on this.And what is worse, I believe a lot of whites are in with them
too.A chap named Jackson, and another named Scott, and Isbister and
some others.These names are spoken of on every one of our reserves.I tell you, sir," he said, turning his blind eyes toward the
Superintendent, "I consider it very serious indeed.And worst of all,
the biggest villain of the lot, Little Pine, Cree Chief you know, our
bitterest enemy--except Little Thunder, who fortunately is cleared out
of the country--you remember, sir, that chap Raven saw about that.""Well--where was I?--Oh, yes, Little Pine, the biggest villain of them
all, is somewhere about here.I got word of him when I was at the
Blood Reserve on my way home some ten days ago.I heard he was with
the Blackfeet, but I found no sign of him there.But he is in the
neighborhood, and he is specially bound to see old Crowfoot.I
understand he is a particularly successful pleader, and unusually
cunning, and I am afraid of Crowfoot.He was very
cordial and is apparently loyal enough as yet, but you know, sir, how
much that may mean.I think that is all," said Cameron, putting his hand
up to his head."I have a great deal more to tell you, but it will not
come back to me now.Little Pine must be attended to, and for a day or
two I am sorry I am hardly fit--awfully sorry."His voice sank into a
kind of undertone.cried the Superintendent, deeply stirred at the sight of
his obvious collapse.You have
nothing to be sorry for, but everything to be proud of.You have done a
great service to your country, and we will not forget it.In a few days
you will be fit and we shall show our gratitude by calling upon you to
do something more.A horseman had ridden past the
window toward the stables.I would know his splendid horse
anywhere."said the Superintendent, a hard look
upon his face.But the laws of hospitality are nowhere so imperative as on the western
plains.Cameron rose from his chair muttering, "Must look after his
horse.""You sit down," said Mandy firmly."Here, Jerry, go and show him where
to get things, and--" He hesitated."Bring him in," cried Mandy heartily.The men stood silent, looking at
Cameron."Certainly, bring him in," he said firmly, "a day like this," he added,
as if in apology."Why, of course," cried Mandy, looking from one to the other in
surprise.replied Moira, her cheeks burning and her
eyes flashing."You remember," she cried, addressing the Inspector, "how
he saved my life the day I arrived at this ranch.""Oh, yes," replied the Inspector briefly, "I believe I did hear that.""Well, I think he is splendid," repeated Moira."Eh?--well--I can't say I know him very well.""Ah, yes, a most beautiful animal, quite remarkable horse, splendid
horse; in fact one of the finest, if not the very finest, in this whole
country.And that is saying a good deal, too, Miss Moira.You see, this
country breeds good horses."And the Inspector went on to discourse in
full detail and with elaborate illustration upon the various breeds of
horses the country could produce, and to classify the wonderful black
stallion ridden by Raven, and all with such diligence and enthusiasm
that no other of the party had an opportunity to take part in the
conversation till Raven, in the convoy of Jerry, was seen approaching
the house.Cameron, I fear we must take our departure.These are rather
crowded days with us."We can hardly allow
that, you know.Cameron wants to have a great deal more
talk with you."The Superintendent attempted to set forth various other reasons for a
hasty departure, but they all seemed to lack sincerity, and after a few
more ineffective trials he surrendered and sat down again in silence.The next moment the door opened and Raven, followed by Jerry, stepped
into the room.As his eye fell upon the Superintendent, instinctively he
dropped his hands to his hips and made an involuntary movement backward,
but only for an instant.Immediately he came forward and greeted Mandy
with fine, old-fashioned courtesy."So delighted to meet you again, Mrs.Cameron, and also to meet your
charming sister."He shook hands with both the ladies very warmly."Ah, Superintendent," he continued, "delighted to see you.And you,
Inspector," he said, giving them a nod as he laid off his outer leather
riding coat."Hope I see you flourishing," he continued.His debonair
manner had in it a quizzical touch of humor."Ah, Cameron, home again I
see.The men, who had risen to their feet upon his entrance, stood regarding
him stiffly and made no other sign of recognition than a curt nod and a
single word of greeting."You have had quite a trip," he continued, addressing himself to
Cameron, and taking the chair offered by Mandy."I followed you part
way, but you travel too fast for me.Much too strenuous work I found
it.Why," he continued, looking narrowly at Cameron, "you are badly
punished.Raven," said Mandy quickly, for her husband sat
gazing stupidly into the fire."Do you mean to say
that you have been traveling these last three days?""Why, my dear sir, not even the Indians face such cold.Only the Mounted
Police venture out in weather like this--and those who want to get away
from them.His gay, careless laugh rang
out in the most cheery fashion.Mandy could not understand their grim and gloomy silence.By her
cordiality she sought to cover up and atone for the studied and almost
insulting indifference of her husband and her other guests.In these
attempts she was loyally supported by her sister-in-law, whose anger was
roused by the all too obvious efforts on the part of her brother and
his friends to ignore this stranger, if not to treat him with contempt.There was nothing in Raven's manner to indicate that he observed
anything amiss in the bearing of the male members of the company about
the fire.He met the attempt of the ladies at conversation with a
brilliancy of effort that quite captivated them, and, in spite of
themselves, drew the Superintendent and the Inspector into the flow of
talk.As the hour of the midday meal approached Mandy rose from her place by
the fire and said:

"You will stay with us to dinner, Mr.It is
not often we have such a distinguished and interesting company.""I merely looked in to give your husband
a bit of interesting information.And, by the way, I have a bit of
information that might interest the Superintendent as well.""Well," said Mandy, "we are to have the pleasure of the Superintendent
and the Inspector to dinner with us to-day, and you can give them all
the information you think necessary while you are waiting."Raven hesitated while he glanced at the faces of the men beside him.What he read there drew from him a little hard smile of amused contempt."Please do not ask me again, Mrs."You know not how
you strain my powers of resistance when I really dare not--may not," he
corrected himself with a quick glance at the Superintendent, "stay in
this most interesting company and enjoy your most grateful hospitality
any longer.First of all for you,
Cameron--I shall not apologize to you, Mrs.Cameron, for delivering
it in your presence.I do you the honor to believe that you ought to
know--briefly my information is this.Little Pine, in whose movements
you are all interested, I understand, is at this present moment lodging
with the Sarcee Indians, and next week will move on to visit old
Crowfoot.The Sarcee visit amounts to little, but the visit to old
Crowfoot--well, I need say no more to you, Cameron.Probably you know
more about the inside workings of old Crowfoot's mind than I do.""That is his present intention, and I have no doubt the program will
be carried out," said Raven.Of
course," he continued, "I know you have run across the trail of the
North Cree and Salteaux runners from Big Bear and Beardy.But Little Pine is a different person from these
gentlemen.The big game is scheduled for the early spring, will probably
come off in about six weeks.And now," he said, rising from his chair,
"I must be off."At this point Smith came in and quietly took a seat beside Jerry near
the door."And what's your information for me, Mr."You are not going to deprive me of my bit of news?""Ah, yes--news," replied Raven, sitting down again.Little Thunder has yielded to some powerful pressure and has again
found it necessary to visit this country, I need hardly add, against my
desire."exclaimed the Superintendent, and his tone indicated
something more than surprise.And where does this--ah--this--ah--friend of yours propose to locate
himself?""This friend of mine," replied Raven, with a hard gleam in his eye and
a bitter smile curling his lips, "who would gladly adorn his person with
my scalp if he might, will not ask my opinion as to his location, and
probably not yours either, Mr.As Raven ceased speaking
he once more rose from his chair, put on his leather riding coat and
took up his cap and gauntlets.Cameron," he said,
offering her his hand."Believe me, it has been a rare treat to see you
and to sit by your fireside for one brief half-hour."Raven, you are not to think of leaving us before dinner."The trail I take," said Raven in a grave voice, "is full of pitfalls
and I must take it when I can.But his smile awoke no response in the Superintendent, who sat rigidly
silent."It's a mighty cold day outside," interjected Smith, "and blowing up
something I think."blurted out Cameron, who sat stupidly gazing into
the fire, "Stay and eat.This is no kind of day to go out hungry."Thanks, Cameron, it IS a cold day, too cold to stay."He turned swiftly and looked into her soft brown eyes now filled with
warm kindly light."Alas, Miss Cameron," he replied in a low voice, turning his back upon
the others, his voice and his attitude seeming to isolate the girl from
the rest of the company, "believe me, if I do not stay it is not because
I do not want to, but because I cannot."echoed Moira in an equally low tone.Then, raising his voice, "Ask the
Superintendent.said Moira, turning upon the Superintendent, "What does
he mean?""If he cannot remain here
he knows why without appealing to me.""Ah, my dear Superintendent, how unfeeling!You hardly do yourself
justice," said Raven, proceeding to draw on his gloves.His drawling
voice seemed to irritate the Superintendent beyond control."Justice is a word you should hesitate
to use.""You see, Miss Cameron," said Raven with an injured air, "why I cannot
remain.""I do not see," she
repeated, "and if the Superintendent does I think he should explain."It wakened her brother as if from a
daze."Do not interfere where you do not
understand.""Then why make insinuations that cannot be explained?"cried his sister,
standing up very straight and looking the Superintendent fair in the
face.echoed the Superintendent in a cool, almost contemptuous,
voice."There are certain things best not explained, but believe me if
Mr.Quickly Moira turned to Raven with a
gesture of appeal and a look of loyal confidence in her eyes.For a
moment the hard, cynical face was illumined with a smile of rare beauty,
but only for a moment.The gleam passed and the old, hard, cynical face
turned in challenge to the Superintendent.breathed Moira, a thrill of triumphant relief in her voice, "he
cannot explain."cried the little half-breed, quivering with rage.What for he can no h'explain?Dem horse he steal de
night-tam'--dat whiskee he trade on de Indian.John moved to the garden.He no good--he one
beeg tief.Me--I put him one sure place he no steal no more!"A few moments of tense silence held the group rigid.In the center stood
Raven, his face pale, hard, but smiling, before him Moira, waiting,
eager, with lips parted and eyes aglow with successive passions,
indignation, doubt, fear, horror, grief.Again that swift and subtle
change touched Raven's face as his eyes rested upon the face of the girl
before him."Now you know why I cannot stay," he said gently, almost sadly."It is not true," murmured Moira, piteous appeal in voice and eyes.A
spasm crossed the pale face upon which her eyes rested, then the old
cynical look returned.Cameron," he said with a bow to Mandy, "for
a happy half-hour by your fireside, and farewell.""Good-by," said Mandy sadly."Oh, good-by, good-by," cried the girl impulsively, reaching out her
hand."I shall not forget that you were kind to
me."He bent low before her, but did not touch her outstretched hand.As
he turned toward the door Jerry slipped in before him.he cried excitedly, looking at the Superintendent; but
before the latter could answer a hand caught him by the coat collar
and with a swift jerk landed him on the floor.It was Smith, his face
furiously red.Before Jerry could recover himself Raven had opened the
door and passed out.said Mandy in a hushed, broken voice.Moira stood for a moment as if dazed, then suddenly turned to Smith and
said:

"Thank you.And Smith, red to his hair roots, murmured, "You wanted him to go?""Yes," said Moira, "I wanted him to go."CHAPTER XVI

WAR


Commissioner Irvine sat in his office at headquarters in the little town
of Regina, the capital of the North West Territories of the Dominion.A
number of telegrams lay before him on the table.A look of grave anxiety
was on his face.The cause of his anxiety was to be found in the news
contained in the telegrams.In a few moments Inspector Sanders made his appearance, a tall,
soldierlike man, trim in appearance, prompt in movement and somewhat
formal in speech."Well, the thing has come," said the Commissioner, handing Inspector
Sanders one of the telegrams before him.Inspector Sanders took the
wire, read it and stood very erect."Looks like it, sir," he replied."It is just eight months since I first warned the government that
trouble would come.Superintendent Crozier knows the situation
thoroughly and would not have sent this wire if outbreak were not
imminent.Then here is one from Superintendent Gagnon at Carlton.Inspector Sanders gravely read the second telegram."We ought to have five hundred men on the spot this minute," he said."I have asked that a hundred men be sent up at once," said the
Commissioner, "but I am doubtful if we can get the Government to agree.It seems almost impossible to make the authorities feel the gravity
of the situation.They cannot realize, for one thing, the enormous
distances that separate points that look comparatively near together
upon the map.""And yet," he
continued, "they have these maps before them, and the figures, but
somehow the facts do not impress them.Look at this vast area lying
between these four posts that form an almost perfect quadrilateral.Here is the north line running from Edmonton at the northwest corner
to Prince Albert at the northeast, nearly four hundred miles away;
then here is the south line running from Macleod at the southwest four
hundred and fifty miles to Regina at the southeast; while the sides of
this quadrilateral are nearly three hundred miles long.Thus the four
posts forming our quadrilateral are four hundred miles apart one way by
three hundred another, and, if we run the lines down to the boundary and
to the limit of the territory which we patrol, the disturbed area may
come to be about five hundred miles by six hundred; and we have some
five hundred men available.""It is a good thing we have established the new post at Carlton,"
suggested Inspector Sanders.It is true we have strengthened up that
district recently with two hundred men distributed between Battleford,
Prince Albert, Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton.But Carlton is naturally a
very weak post and is practically of little use to us.True, it guards
us against those Willow Crees and acts as a check upon old Beardy.""A troublesome man, that Kah-me-yes-too-waegs--old Beardy, I mean.It
took me some time to master that one," said Inspector Sanders, "but then
I have studied German.He always has been a nuisance," continued the
Inspector."He was a groucher when the treaty was made in '76 and he has
been a groucher ever since.""If we only had the men, just another five hundred," replied the
Commissioner, tapping the map before him with his finger, "we should
hold this country safe.John went back to the kitchen.But what with these restless half-breeds led by
this crack-brained Riel, and these ten thousand Indians--"

"Not to speak of a couple of thousand non-treaty Indians roaming the
country and stirring up trouble," interjected the Inspector."True enough," replied the Commissioner, "but I would have no fear
of the Indians were it not for these half-breeds.They have real
grievances, remember, Sanders, real grievances, and that gives force to
their quarrel and cohesion to the movement.Men who have a conviction
that they are suffering injustice are not easily turned aside.They ride hard and shoot straight and are afraid of
nothing.I confess frankly it looks very serious to me.""For my part," said Inspector Sanders, "it is the Indians I fear most."Really,
one wonders at the docility of the Indians, and their response to fair
and decent treatment.Twenty years ago, no,
fifteen years ago, less than fifteen years ago, these Indians whom we
have been holding in our hand so quietly were roaming these plains,
living like lords on the buffalo and fighting like fiends with each
other, free from all control.Little wonder if, now feeling the pinch of
famine, fretting under the monotony of pastoral life, and being
incited to war by the hot-blooded half-breeds, they should break out
in rebellion.Just this, a feeling
that they have been justly treated, fairly and justly dealt with by the
Government, and a wholesome respect for Her Majesty's North West Mounted
Police, if I do say it myself.But the thing is on, and we must be
ready.""Well, thank God, there is not much to be done in the way of
preparation," replied the Commissioner.For the past six months we have been on the alert for this emergency,
but we must strike promptly.When I think of these settlers about Prince
Albert and Battleford at the mercy of Beardy and that restless and
treacherous Salteaux, Big Bear, I confess to a terrible anxiety.""Then there is the West, sir, as well," said Sanders, "the Blackfeet and
the Bloods."So do I. It is a great matter
that Crowfoot is well disposed toward us, that he has confidence in our
officers and that he is a shrewd old party as well.But Crowfoot is an
Indian and the head of a great tribe with warlike traditions and with
ambitions, and he will find it difficult to maintain his own loyalty,
and much more that of his young men, in the face of any conspicuous
successes by his Indian rivals, the Crees.But," added the Commissioner,
rolling up the map, "I called you in principally to say that I wish you
to have every available man and gun ready for a march at a day's notice.Further, I wish you to wire Superintendent Herchmer at Calgary to
send at the earliest possible moment twenty-five men at least, fully
equipped.We shall need every man we can spare from every post in the
West to send North."They will be ready," said Inspector Sanders, and,
saluting, he left the room.Two days later, on the 18th of March, long before the break of day, the
Commissioner set out on his famous march to Prince Albert, nearly three
hundred miles away.They were but a small
company of ninety men, but every man was thoroughly fit for the part
he was expected to play in the momentous struggle before him; brave, of
course, trained in prompt initiative, skilled in plaincraft, inured to
hardship, oblivious of danger, quick of eye, sure of hand and rejoicing
in fight.Commissioner Irvine knew he could depend upon them to see
through to a finish, to their last ounce of strength and their last
blood-drop, any bit of work given them to do.Past Pie-a-pot's Reserve
and down the Qu'Appelle Valley to Misquopetong's, through the Touchwood
Hills and across the great Salt Plain, where he had word by wire from
Crozier of the first blow being struck at the south branch of the
Saskatchewan where some of Beardy's men gave promise of their future
conduct by looting a store, Irvine pressed his march.Onward along the
Saskatchewan, he avoided the trap laid by four hundred half-breeds at
Batoche's Crossing, and, making the crossing at Agnew's, further down,
arrived at Prince Albert all fit and sound on the eve of the 24th,
completing his two hundred and ninety-one miles in just seven days; and
that in the teeth of the bitter weather of a rejuvenated winter, without
loss of man or horse, a feat worthy of the traditions of the Force of
which he was the head, and of the Empire whose most northern frontier it
was his task to guard.Twenty-four hours to sharpen their horses' calks and tighten up their
cinches, and Irvine was on the trail again en route for Fort Carlton,
where he learned serious disturbances were threatening.Arrived at Fort
Carlton in the afternoon of the same day, the Commissioner found there a
company of men, sad, grim and gloomy.In the fort a dozen of the gallant
volunteers from Prince Albert and Crozier's Mounted Police lay groaning,
some of them dying, with wounds.Others lay with their faces covered,
quiet enough; while far down on the Duck Lake trail still others lay
with the white snow red about them.The story was told the Commissioner
with soldierlike brevity by Superintendent Crozier.The previous day a
storekeeper from Duck Lake, Mitchell by name, had ridden in to report
that his stock of provisions and ammunition was about to be seized by
the rebels.Immediately early next morning a Sergeant of the Police with
some seventeen constables had driven off to prevent these provisions and
ammunition falling into the hands of the enemy.At ten o'clock a scout
came pounding down the trail with the announcement that Sergeant Stewart
was in trouble and that a hundred rebels had disputed his advance.Hard upon the heels of the scout came the Sergeant himself with his
constables to tell their tale to a body of men whose wrath grew as
they listened.More and more furious waxed their rage as they heard
the constables tell of the threats and insults heaped upon them by the
half-breeds and Indians.The Prince Albert volunteers more especially
were filled with indignant rage.To think that half-breeds and
Indians--Indians, mark you!--whom they had been accustomed to regard
with contempt, should have dared to turn back upon the open trail a
company of men wearing the Queen's uniform!The Police officers received the news with philosophic calm.It was
merely an incident in the day's work to them.Sooner or later they would
bring these bullying half-breeds and yelling Indians to task for their
temerity.But the volunteers were undisciplined in the business of receiving
insults.The Superintendent
pointed out that the Commissioner was within touch bringing
reinforcements.It might be wise to delay matters a few hours till his
arrival.But meantime the provisions and ammunition would be looted
and distributed among the enemy, and that was a serious matter.The
impetuous spirit of the volunteers prevailed.Within an hour a hundred
men with a seven-pr.gun, eager to exact punishment for the insults
they had suffered, took the Duck Lake trail.Ambushed by a foe who,
regardless of the conventions of war, made treacherous use of the white
flag, overwhelmed by more than twice their number, hampered in their
evolutions by the deep crusted snow, the little company, after a
half-hour's sharp engagement with the strongly posted enemy, were forced
to retire, bearing their wounded and some of their dead with them,
leaving others of their dead lying in the snow behind them.And now the question was what was to be done?The events of the day
had taught them their lesson, a lesson that experience has taught all
soldiers, the lesson, namely, that it is never safe to despise a foe.A few miles away from them were between three hundred and four hundred
half-breeds and Indians who, having tasted blood, were eager for more.The fort at Carlton was almost impossible of defense.The whole South
country was in the hands of rebels.Companies of half-breeds breathing
blood and fire, bands of Indians, marauding and terrorizing, were
roaming the country, wrecking homesteads, looting stores, threatening
destruction to all loyal settlers and direst vengeance upon all who
should dare to oppose them.The situation called for quick thought and
quick action.Every hour added to the number of the enemy.Whole tribes
of Indians were wavering in their allegiance.Another victory such as
Duck Lake and they would swing to the side of the rebels.The strategic
center of the English settlements in all this country was undoubtedly
Prince Albert.Fort Carlton stood close to the border of the half-breed
section and was difficult of defense.After a short council of war it was decided to abandon Fort Carlton.Thereupon Irvine led his troops, together with the gallant survivors of
the bloody fight at Duck Lake, bearing their dead and wounded with
them, to Prince Albert, there to hold that post with its hundreds of
defenseless women and children gathered in from the country round about,
against hostile half-breeds without and treacherous half-breeds within
the stockade, and against swarming bands of Indians hungry for loot and
thirsting for blood.And there Irvine, chafing against inactivity, eager
for the joyous privilege of attack, spent the weary anxious days of the
next six weeks, held at his post by the orders of his superior officer
and by the stern necessities of the case, and meantime finding some
slight satisfaction in scouting and scouring the country for miles on
every side, thus preventing any massing of the enemy's forces.The affair at Duck Lake put an end to all parley.Riel had been
clamoring for "blood!At Duck Lake he received his first
taste, but before many days were over he was to find that for every drop
of blood that reddened the crusted snow at Duck Lake a thousand Canadian
voices would indignantly demand vengeance.The rifle-shots that rang out
that winter day from the bluffs that lined the Duck Lake trail echoed
throughout Canada from ocean to ocean, and everywhere men sprang to
offer themselves in defense of their country.But echoes of these
rifle-shots rang, too, in the teepees on the Western plains where the
Piegans, the Bloods and the Blackfeet lay crouching and listening.By some mysterious system of telegraphy known only to themselves old
Crowfoot and his braves heard them almost as soon as the Superintendent
at Fort Macleod.Instantly every teepee was pulsing with the fever of
war.The young braves dug up their rifles from their bedding, gathered
together their ammunition, sharpened their knives and tomahawks in eager
anticipation of the call that would set them on the war-path against the
white man who had robbed them of their ancient patrimony and who held
them in such close leash.The great day had come, the day they had been
dreaming of in their hearts, talking over at their council-fires and
singing about in their sun dances during the past year, the day promised
by the many runners from their brother Crees of the North, the day
foretold by the great Sioux orator and leader, Onawata.The war of
extermination had begun and the first blood had gone to the Indian and
to his brother half-breed.Two days after Duck Lake came the word that Fort Carlton had been
abandoned and Battleford sacked.Five days later the news of the bloody
massacre of Frog Lake cast over every English settlement the shadow of
a horrible fear.From the Crow's Nest to the Blackfoot Crossing bands of
braves broke loose from the reserves and began to "drive cattle" for the
making of pemmican in preparation for the coming campaign.It was a day of testing for all Canadians, but especially a day of
testing for the gallant little force of six or seven hundred riders who,
distributed in small groups over a vast area of over two hundred and
fifty thousand square miles, were entrusted with the responsibility of
guarding the lives and property of Her Majesty's subjects scattered in
lonely and distant settlements over these wide plains.For while the Ottawa authorities with
late but frantic haste were hustling their regiments from all parts of
Canada to the scene of war, the Mounted Police had gripped the situation
with a grip so stern that the Indian allies of the half-breed rebels
paused in their leap, took a second thought and decided to wait till
events should indicate the path of discretion.And, to the blood-lusting Riel, Irvine's swift thrust Northward to
Prince Albert suggested caution, while his resolute stand at that
distant fort drove hard down in the North country a post of Empire that
stuck fast and sure while all else seemed to be sliding to destruction.Inspector Dickens, too, another of that fearless band of Police
officers, holding with his heroic little company of twenty-two
constables Fort Pitt in the far North, stayed the panic consequent upon
the Frog Lake massacre and furnished food for serious thought to the
cunning Chief, Little Pine, and his four hundred and fifty Crees, as
well as to the sullen Salteaux, Big Bear, with his three hundred braves.And to the lasting credit of Inspector Dickens it stands that he brought
his little company of twenty-two safe through a hostile country
overrun with excited Indians and half-breeds to the post of Battleford,
ninety-eight miles away.At Battleford, also, after the sacking of the town, Inspector Morris
with two hundred constables behind his hastily-constructed barricade
kept guard over four hundred women and children and held at bay a horde
of savages yelling for loot and blood.Griesbach, in like manner, with his little handful, at Fort
Saskatchewan, held the trail to Edmonton, and materially helped to bar
the way against Big Bear and his marauding band.And similarly at other points the promptness, resource, wisdom and
dauntless resolution of the gallant officers of the Mounted Police
and of the men they commanded saved Western Canada from the complete
subversion of law and order in the whole Northern part of the
territories and from the unspeakable horrors of a general Indian
uprising.But while in the Northern and Eastern part of the Territories the Police
officers rendered such signal service in the face of open rebellion, it
was in the foothill country in the far West that perhaps even greater
service was rendered to Canada and the Empire in this time of peril by
the officers and men of the Mounted Police.It was due to the influence of such men as the Superintendents and
Inspectors of the Police in charge of the various posts throughout
the foothill country more than to anything else that the Chiefs of
the "great, warlike, intelligent and untractable tribes" of Blackfeet,
Blood, Piegan, Sarcee and Stony Indians were prevented from breaking
their treaties and joining with the rebel Crees, Salteaux and
Assiniboines of the North and East.For fifteen years the Chiefs of
these tribes had lived under the firm and just rule of the Police, had
been protected from the rapacity of unscrupulous traders and saved from
the ravages of whisky-runners.It was the proud boast of a Blood Chief
that the Police never broke a promise to the Indian and never failed to
exact justice either for his punishment or for his protection.Hence when the reserves were being overrun by emissaries from the
turbulent Crees and from the plotting half-breeds, in the face of the
impetuous demands of their own young men and of their minor Chiefs to
join in the Great Adventure, the great Chiefs, Red Crow and Rainy Chief
of the Bloods, Bull's Head of the Sarcees, Trotting Wolf of the Piegans,
and more than all, Crowfoot, the able, astute, wise old head of
the entire Blackfeet confederacy, held these young braves back from
rebellion and thus gave time and opportunity to Her Majesty's Forces
operating in the East and North to deal with the rebels.And during those days of strain, strain beyond the estimate of all
not immediately involved, it was the record of such men as the
Superintendents and Inspectors in charge at Fort Macleod, at Fort
Calgary and on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction
in the mountains, and their steady bearing that more than anything else
weighed with the great Chiefs and determined for them their attitude.For with calm, cool courage the Police patrols rode in and out of the
reserves, quietly reasoning with the big Chiefs, smiling indulgently
upon the turbulent minor Chiefs, checking up with swift, firm, but
tactful justice the many outbreaks against law and order, presenting
even in their most desperate moments such a front of resolute
self-confidence to the Indians, and refusing to give any sign by look
or word or act of the terrific anxiety they carried beneath their gay
scarlet coats.And the big Chiefs, reading the faces of these cool,
careless, resolute, smiling men who had a trick of appearing at
unexpected times in their camps and refused to be hurried or worried,
finally decided to wait a little longer.And they waited till the fatal
moment of danger was past and the time for striking--and in the heart
of every Chief of them the desire to strike for larger freedom and
independence lay deep--was gone.To these guardians of Empire who fought
no fight, who endured no siege, who witnessed no massacre, the Dominion
and the Empire owe more than none but the most observing will ever know.Paralleling these prompt measures of the North West Mounted Police, the
Government dispatched from both East and West of Canada regiments of
militia to relieve the beleaguered posts held by the Police, to prevent
the spread of rebellion and to hold the great tribes of the Indians of
the far West true to their allegiance.Already on the 27th of March, before Irvine had decided to abandon Fort
Carlton and to make his stand at Prince Albert, General Middleton had
passed through Winnipeg on his way to take command of the Canadian
Forces operating in the West; and before two weeks more had gone the
General was in command of a considerable body of troops at Qu'Appelle,
his temporary headquarters.From all parts of Canada these men gathered,
from Quebec and Montreal, from the midland counties of Ontario, from
the city of Toronto and from the city of Winnipeg, till some five or six
thousand citizen-soldiers were under arms.They were needed, too, every
man, not so much because of the possible weight of numbers of the enemy
opposing them, nor because of the tactical skill of those leading the
hostile forces, but because of the enemy's advantage of position, owing
to the nature of the country which formed the scene of the Rebellion,
and because of the character of the warfare adopted by their cunning
foe.The record of the brief six weeks' campaign constitutes a creditable
page in Canadian history, a page which no Canadian need blush to read
aloud in the presence of any company of men who know how to estimate at
their highest value those qualities of courage and endurance that are
the characteristics of the British soldier the world over.Superintendent Strong was in a pleasant mood, and the reason was not far
to seek.The distracting period of inaction, of doubt, of hesitation was
past, and now at last something would be done.His term of service along
the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction had been far from
congenial to him.There had been too much of the work of the ordinary
patrol-officer about it.True, he did his duty faithfully and
thoroughly, so faithfully, indeed, as to move the great men of the
railway company to outspoken praise, a somewhat unusual circumstance.But now he was called back to the work that more properly belonged to an
officer of Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police and his soul glowed
with the satisfaction of those who, having been found faithful in
uncongenial duty, are rewarded with an opportunity to do a bit of work
which they particularly delight to do.With his twenty-five men, whom for the past year he had been polishing
to a high state of efficiency in the trying work of police-duty in the
railway construction-camp, he arrived in Calgary on the evening of the
tenth of April, to find that post throbbing with military ardor and
thrilling with rumors of massacres and sieges, of marching columns and
contending forces.Small wonder that Superintendent Strong's face took
on an appearance of grim pleasure.Straight to the Police headquarters
he went, but there was no Superintendent there to welcome him.That
gentleman had gone East to meet the troops and was by now under
appointment as Chief of Staff to that dashing soldier, Colonel Otter.But meantime, though the Calgary Police Post was bare of men, there were
other men as keen and as daring, if not so thoroughly disciplined for
war, thronging the streets of the little town and asking only a leader
whom they could follow.It was late evening, but Calgary was an "all night" town, and every
minute was precious, for minutes might mean lives of women and children.So down the street rode Superintendent Strong toward the Royal Hotel.At
the hitching post of that hostelry a sad-looking broncho was tied, whose
calm, absorbed and detached appearance struck a note of discord with his
environment; for everywhere about him men and horses seemed to be in
a turmoil of excitement.Everywhere men in cow-boy garb were careering
about the streets or grouped in small crowds about the saloon doors.There were few loud voices, but the words of those who were doing the
speaking came more rapidly than usual.Such a group was gathered in the rear of the sad-looking broncho before
the door of the Royal Hotel.As the Superintendent loped up upon his
big brown horse the group broke apart and, like birds disturbed at their
feeding, circled about and closed again."Hello, here's Superintendent Strong," said a voice.There were many voices, all eager, and in them just a touch of anxiety."Not a thing do I know," said Superintendent Strong somewhat gravely."I have been up in the mountains and have heard little.I know that the
Commissioner has gone north to Prince Albert.""Yes, I heard we had a reverse there, and I know that General Middleton
has arrived at Qu'Appelle and has either set out for the north or is
about to set out."For a moment there was silence, then a deep voice replied:

"A ghastly massacre, women and children and priests."murmured the Superintendent in a low voice.Sandra went to the bedroom."Yes, half-breeds and Indians," replied the deep voice.The Superintendent sat on his big horse looking at them quietly, then he
said sharply:

"Men, there are some five or six thousand Indians in this district.""I have twenty-five men with me.Superintendent Cotton at Macleod has less than a hundred."The men sat their horses in silence looking at him.One could hear their
deep breathing and see the quiver of the horses under the gripping knees
of their riders.Ever since the news
of the Frog Lake massacre had spread like a fire across the country
these men had been carrying in their minds--rather, in their
hearts--pictures that started them up in their beds at night broad awake
and all in a cold sweat.He had only a single word to say, a short sharp word it was--

"Who will join me?"It was as if his question had released a spring drawn to its limit.From
twenty different throats in twenty different tones, but with a single
throbbing impulse, came the response, swift, full-throated, savage,
"Me!"and in three
minutes Superintendent Strong had secured the nucleus of his famous
scouts."To-morrow at nine at the Barracks!"said this grim and laconic
Superintendent, and was about turning away when a man came out from the
door of the Royal Hotel, drawn forth by that sudden savage yell.said the Superintendent, as the man moved toward the
sad-appearing broncho, "I want you."I am with you," was the reply as Cameron swung on to
his horse.he said to his horse, touching him with
his heel.Ginger woke up with an indignant snort and forthwith fell into
line with the Superintendent's big brown horse.The Superintendent was silent till the Barracks were gained, then,
giving the horses into the care of an orderly, he led Cameron into the
office and after they had settled themselves before the fire he began
without preliminaries."Cameron, I am more anxious than I can say about the situation here in
this part of the country.I have been away from the center of things for
some months and I have lost touch.I want you to let me know just what
is doing from our side.""I do not know much, sir," replied Cameron."I, too, have just come in
from a long parley with Crowfoot and his Chiefs.""Ah, by the way, how is the old boy?""At present he is very loyal, sir,--too loyal almost," said Cameron in
a doubtful tone."Duck Lake sent some of his young men off their heads a
bit, and Frog Lake even more.The Sarcees went wild over Frog Lake, you
know.""Oh, I don't worry about the Sarcees so much."Well, he has managed to hold down his younger Chiefs so far.He made
light of the Frog Lake affair, but he was most anxious to get from
me the fullest particulars of the Duck Lake fight.He made careful
inquiries as to just how many Police were in the fight.I could see that
it gave him a shock to learn that the Police had to retire.He was intensely anxious to learn also--though
he would not allow himself to appear so--just what the Government was
doing.""And what are the last reports from headquarters?You see I have not
been kept fully in touch.I know that the Commissioner has gone north to
Prince Albert and that General Middleton has taken command of the forces
in the West and has gone North with them from Qu'Appelle, but what
troops he has I have not heard.""I understand," replied Cameron, "that he has three regiments of
infantry from Toronto and three from Winnipeg, with the Winnipeg Field
Battery.A regiment from Quebec has arrived and one from Montreal and
there are more to follow."Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I know something about the
plan, I believe.There are three objective points, Prince Albert and
Battleford, both of which are now closely besieged, and Edmonton,
which is threatened with a great body of rebel Crees and Salteaux under
leadership of Little Pine and Big Bear.The Police at these points can
hardly be expected to hold out long against the overwhelming numbers
that are besieging them, and I expect that relief columns will be
immediately dispatched.Now, in regard to this district here, do you
know what is being done?""Well, General Strange has come in from his ranch and has offered his
services in raising a local force.""Yes, I was glad to hear that his offer had been accepted and that he
has been appointed to lead an expeditionary force from here to Edmonton.He is an experienced officer and I am sure will do us fine service.Now, about the South," continued the
Superintendent, "what about Fort Macleod?""The Superintendent there has offered himself and his whole force for
service in the North, but General Middleton, I understand, has asked him
to remain where he is and keep guard in this part of the country."The
Crees I do not fear so much.They are more restless and uncertain, but
God help us if the Blackfeet and the Bloods rise!That is why I called
for volunteers to-night.We cannot afford to be without a strong force
here a single day.""I gathered that you got some volunteers to-night.I hope, sir," said
Cameron, "you will have a place for me in your troop?""My dear fellow, nothing would please me better, I assure you," said
the Superintendent cordially."And as proof of my confidence in you I am
going to send you through the South country to recruit men for my troop.But as for you, you cannot leave
your present beat.The Sun Dance Trail cannot be abandoned for one hour.From it you keep an eye upon the secret movements of all the tribes in
this whole region and you can do much to counteract if not to wholly
check any hostile movement that may arise.Indeed, you have already done
more than any one will ever know to hold this country safe during these
last months.Remember, Cameron," added
the Superintendent impressively, "your work lies along the Sun Dance
Trail.On no account and for no reason must you be persuaded to abandon
that post.I shall get into touch with General Strange to-morrow and
shall doubtless get something to do, but if possible I should like you
to give me a day or two for this recruiting business before you take up
again your patrol work along the Sun Dance.""Very well, sir," replied Cameron quietly, trying hard to keep the
disappointment out of his voice."By the way, what are the
Piegans doing?""The Piegans," replied Cameron, "are industriously stealing cattle and
horses.I cannot quite make out just how they can manage to get away
with them.Eagle Feather is apparently running the thing, but there is
someone bigger than Eagle Feather in the game.An additional month or
two in the guardroom would have done that gentleman no harm.""Ah, has he been in the guard-room?"Oh, I pulled him out of the Sun Dance, where I found he had been
killing cattle, and the Superintendent at Macleod gave him two months to
meditate upon his crimes.""But now he is at his old habits again," continued Cameron."But his
is not the brain planning these raids.They are cleverly done and are
getting serious.For instance, I must have lost a score or two of steers
within the last three months.""What are they doing
with them all?""That is what I find difficult to explain.Either they are running them
across the border--though the American Police know nothing of it--or
they are making pemmican."that looks serious," said the Superintendent gravely."It makes me think that some one bigger
than Eagle Feather is at the bottom of all this cattle-running.Sometimes I have thought that perhaps that chap Raven has a hand in it.""He has brain enough and nerve in
plenty for any dare-devil exploit.""But," continued Cameron in a hesitating voice, "I cannot bring myself
to lay this upon him.""He is a cool hand and
desperate."Yes, I know he is all that, and yet--well--in this rebellion, sir,
I believe he is with us and against them."In proof of this Cameron
proceeded to relate the story of Raven's visit to the Big Horn Ranch."So you see," he concluded, "he would not care to work in connection
with the Piegans just now.""I don't know about that--I don't know about that," replied the
Superintendent."Of course he would not work against us directly
