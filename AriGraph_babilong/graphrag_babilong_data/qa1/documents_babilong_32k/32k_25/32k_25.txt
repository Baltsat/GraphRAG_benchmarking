"If you
cannot convince HIM, your own brother, I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER, a servant, over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK, when, on your own showing, she has everything
to gain by the marriage.Bilson, the proprietor, to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brother,"--Miss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the card-room incident,--"it
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage."His reason told him
that she was right.More than that, a certain admiration for her
clear-sightedness began to possess him, with the feeling that he would
like to have "shown up" a little better than he had in this interview.If Chris had fallen in love with HER--but Chris was a fool and wouldn't
have appreciated her!"But you might talk with her, Miss Trotter," he said, now completely
subdued."Even if you could not reason her out of it, you might find
out what she expects from this marriage.If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me"--

"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have," said
Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr.Calton thought quite pretty,
"but I will see about it."Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire.She certainly
was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day,
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and post-office.Her way home again lay through the Summit woods.It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Frida's flirtations.Bilson's presumed gallantries,
however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world,
with a serious engagement with young Calton.She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr.Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood;
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long
ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains.She
smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections.Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex;
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion?Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret.Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense
against such sentiment.Was there something in her manner that forbade
it?She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against
it.It was quite warm; she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait, and checked herself, halting in the warm breath of the
syringas.Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized,
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts.She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her, panting, partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment.His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile; his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern."I saw you--go into the wood--but I lost you," he said, breathing
quickly, "and then when I did see you again--you were walking so fast
I had to run after you.I wanted--to speak--to you--if you'll let me.I
won't detain you--I can walk your way."Miss Trotter was a little softened, but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation.She drew her neat skirts aside, and made way for
him on the path beside her."You see," he went on nervously, taking long strides to her shorter
ones, and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment, "my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida, and trying to
put you against her and me.He said as much to me, and added you half
promised to help him!But I didn't believe him--Miss Trotter!--I know
you wouldn't do it--you haven't got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl!He says he has every confidence in you--that you're worth a dozen
such girls as she is, and that I'm a big fool or I'd see it.I don't
say you're not all he says, Miss Trotter; but I'm not such a fool as he
thinks, for I know your GOODNESS too.I know how you tended me when
I was ill, and how you sent Frida to comfort me.You know, too,--for
you're a woman yourself,--that all you could say, or anybody could,
wouldn't separate two people who loved each other."Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed, and this made her a
little angry."I don't think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter," she said icily; "and if you are quite
satisfied, as you say you are, of your own affection and Frida's, I do
not see why you should care for anybody'sinterference.""Now you are angry with me," he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth; "and I've just done it.Oh,
Miss Trotter, don't!I didn't mean to say your talk
was no good.I didn't mean to say you couldn't help us.He reached out his hand, grasped her slim fingers in his own, and
pressed them, holding them and even arresting her passage.The act was
without familiarity or boldness, and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning, instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it.She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk, and said, with a smile:--

"Then you confess you need help--in what way?"Was
it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity?"Then you are not quite sure of her?""She's so high spirited, you know," he said humbly, "and so attractive,
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of her,--well!"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despair--"there's no knowing what she might do."Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower,
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides.Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said,
"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.""I don't say that, Miss Trotter," said Chris pleadingly, yet with a
slight wincing at her words; "YOU could convince her, if you would only
try.Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself.Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there!If you will only
help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until
you have talked with her.Even my brother would not object
to that.And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've
more--don't you see?Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?"He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers.Indeed, it seemed to
her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness.None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple, weak, and loving young man.Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.Nevertheless, this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense.She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then said, with a
faint smile, "Perhaps she does not trust YOU.He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment.It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter; eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color,
clearness, and half tender insight.He dropped her hand with a new-found
timidity, and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer."I mean," she said, stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable "buckeyes" marked the extreme edge of the
woods,--"I mean that you are still very young, and as Frida is
nearly your own age,"--she could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendo,--"she may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition; she may even think my interference is a proof of it; but,"
she added quickly, to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her, "I will speak to her,
and," she concluded playfully, "you must take the consequences."He said "Thank you," but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested, and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes.Miss
Trotter did not notice it, as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away."Look," she said in a lower
voice, "I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing."It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them.There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure, nor the long yellow braids that hung Marguerite-wise
down her back.With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried, there was, in spite of her affected ease, a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head, as if evading or seeking
observation."I will overtake her and speak to her now," continued Miss Trotter."I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone.You can wait here
for my return, if you like."he stammered, with a
faint, tentative smile."Perhaps--don't you think?--I had better go
first and tell her you want to see her.You see,
she might"--He stopped."It was part of your promise, you know, that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken.She has just gone into the
grove."Without another word the young man turned away, and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared.Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed, and, gathering
her skirts about her, sat down to wait.The unwonted attitude, the
whole situation, and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint child's play out of her
lost youth, and she smiled, albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes.Indeed, as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol, the
casual passer-by might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst.She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left, wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous; and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her, her smile became a nervous laugh, and
she found herself actually blushing!He
was walking directly towards her with slow, determined steps, quite
different from his previous nervous agitation, and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance: his
colorful face was pale, his eyes fixed, and he looked ten years older."I came back to tell you," he said, in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed, "that I relieve you of your promise.It
won't be necessary for you to see--Frida.I thank you all the same, Miss
Trotter," he said, avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner."It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me, and to wait here, and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer.Sometime I may tell
you, but not now."asked Miss Trotter quickly, premising Frida's
refusal from his face.He hesitated a moment, then he said gravely, "Yes.Don't ask me any
more, Miss Trotter, please.He paused, and then, with a
slight, uneasy glance toward the pine grove, "Don't let me keep you
waiting here any longer."He took her hand, held it lightly for a
moment, and said, "Go, now."Miss Trotter, slightly bewildered and unsatisfied, nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail.He gazed after her for a moment, and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the <DW72> where he had first
overtaken her, and was soon out of sight.Miss Trotter continued her way
home; but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned, as
if taking some sudden resolution, and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove.What she expected to see there,
possibly she could not have explained; what she actually saw after a
moment's waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr.Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry.Frida's manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity; and although they believed themselves
alone, her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation, indicative of the peasant.But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences.Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness.Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her, and then took
a shorter cut home.She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr.She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool, self-possessed presence.He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen; but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotter's position in the hotel, except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment.He was to be married in San Francisco at
once, and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two; indeed,
he contemplated eventually retiring from business.Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter, which she had ignored, she never betrayed
the least recollection of it.She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness.Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter, an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to, she was, nevertheless,
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chris's
disappointment and unhappiness.Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him; that he had been saved an ill-assorted marriage; that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning.Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings.It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity.She thought of his
boyish appeal to her; of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Frida's relations to Mr.Bilson that afternoon, but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him.How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss!How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion!The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts.It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel; it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression.Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage, he had enjoined secrecy upon her, and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother, who, had he known of Frida's
engagement, would have naturally come to her for explanation.It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother.III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill, it did not, however,
make much scandal, owing, possibly, to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it, and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown.Bilson would be absent for a year,
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter, DID, however, create a stir in that practical business
community.Every one knew
that to Miss Trotter's tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due.Possibly, the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else.Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction; the wives and daughters of the banker, the lawyer, and the
pastor had made much of her, and now, as an independent woman of means,
she stood first in the district.Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her.The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess; middle-aged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California.The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
again,--they had known she was a "real lady" from the first!She
received these attentions, as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament, without pride, affectation, or hesitation.Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr.Bilson's marriage was made known,
and she was called upon by James Calton."I did you a great injustice," he said, with a smile."I don't understand you," she replied a little coldly."Why, this woman and her marriage," he said; "you must have known
something of it all the time, and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris.""You are mistaken," returned Miss Trotter truthfully."Then I have wronged you still more," he said briskly, "for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness.Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him.""Let me tell you once for all, Mr.Calton," she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted, "that I did not interfere in any way
with your brother's suit.He spoke to me of it, and I promised to see
Frida, but he afterwards asked me not to.Calton, "WHATEVER you did, it was most efficacious,
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you, if, indeed, he hasn't really transferred his
affections to you."Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence, or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes.Yet for an instant this calm, collected
woman trembled, not at what Mr.Calton might have noticed, but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF.Calton, construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued
hurriedly:--

"I mean, don't you see, that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have.""You mean, I think, that he has taken his broken heart very lightly,"
said Miss Trotter, with a bitter little laugh, so unlike herself that
Mr.He's regularly cut up, you
know!More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be," he went on, with brotherly directness."It
wouldn't be a bad thing, you know, if you could manage to see him, Miss
Trotter!In fact, as he's off his feed, and has some trouble with his
arm again, owing to all this, I reckon, I've been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till he's better.So long as SHE'S
gone it would be all right, you know!"By this time Miss Trotter was herself again.She reasoned, or thought
she did, that this was a question of the business of the hotel, and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming.The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely.Luckily, she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting.His face had lost its fresh color and round outline; the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache;
his eyes, which had sought hers with a singular seriousness, no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her,
but were filled with an older experience.Indeed, he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that, by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions, she felt herself much younger, and in smile and eye showed
it; at which he  faintly.But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health, and made no allusion to his past
experiences; indeed, ignoring any connection between the two.He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence, had had a relapse in
consequence, and deserved a good scolding!His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure!She should treat him
more severely now, and allow him no indulgences!I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert, but their eyes met and he 
again.Ignoring this also, and promising to look after him occasionally,
she quietly withdrew.But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter.Always scrupulously correct, and even severe in her dress, she
allowed herself certain privileges of color, style, and material.She,
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars,
came out in delicate tints and laces, which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls, slightly tinged with gray.One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white,
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy.The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive; even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition, but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age.For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer.One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air.It was the former "card-room" of the hotel, but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness.She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the
last vestige of his youth."It's very kind of you to invite me in here," he began bitterly, "when
you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool!""I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself," she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else."And I'm a baby who can't," he said angrily.After a pause he burst out
abruptly: "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?""Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood?"she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brother's suggestion.Bilson told
me the same evening.""And I only knew it when news came of their marriage," he said bitterly."But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood," she responded."When I saw them together in the wood?"Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short.Was it possible he had not
seen them together?She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too
late to withdraw her words."Yes," she went on hurriedly, "I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her."He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: "You thought that?I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had
changed my mind!"I did not love
the girl--I never loved her--I was sick of my folly.Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer.Now you know why I didn't go into the wood,
and why I didn't care where she was nor who was with her!""I don't understand," she said, lifting her clear eyes to his coldly."Of course you don't," he said bitterly.And when you do understand you will hate and despise me--if you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool!Hear me out, Miss Trotter, for I am
speaking the truth to you now, if I never spoke it before.I never asked
the girl to marry me!I never said to HER half what I told to YOU, and
when I asked you to intercede with her, I never wanted you to do it--and
never expected you would.""May I ask WHY you did it then?"said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness."You would not believe me if I told you, and you would hate me if you
did."He stopped, and, locking his fingers together, threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her."You never liked me,
Miss Trotter," he said more quietly; "not from the first!From the day
that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy.When I tried to catch
your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him.And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were,
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have.You may not believe me, but
I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen,
and you were so different from the other girls I knew, or the women who
had been kind to me.You may laugh, but it's the truth I'm telling you,
Miss Trotter!"He had relapsed completely into his old pleading, boyish way--it had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida!"I knew you didn't like me that day you came to change the bandages.Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain, you did it so
coldly and precisely; and although I longed to keep you there with me,
you scarcely waited to take my thanks, but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger.And worst of all," he went on more
bitterly, "the doctor knew it too--guessed how I felt toward you, and
laughed at me for my hopelessness!That made me desperate, and put me up
to act the fool.Yes, Miss Trotter; I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida, and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly.And when you simply consented, without a word or
thought about it and me, I knew I was nothing to you."Duchesne's
strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew might
have been the truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words.It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what
else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast.She
felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get
up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless.Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived
her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell
that was upon her, nor did she want to.She must know the culmination of
this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely."The girl was kind and sympathetic," he went on, "but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention.I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he
would tell you, as he did.He would not tell me what you said to him,
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida.Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I
did.I know it was a stupid, clumsy contrivance.It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you.It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me, and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness.And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another.You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised.Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs."She turned quietly, passionately, and, standing up, faced him with a
little cry.He rose too, and catching her hands in his, said, with a white face,
"Because I love you."*****

Half an hour later, when the under-housekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotter's orders, she found that lady quietly writing at the table.Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr.Calton's
rooms would be vacated the next day.When the servant, who, like most of
her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris,
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss
Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that
she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course.She finished her
letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr.Bilson at
Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom,
with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the
last post.As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the
departing guest."It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr.Calton couldn't
stay, as he always said you did him so much good."But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh,
and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands,
cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl.Calton's departure became known the next day, some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor.Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two.He did return for a day; it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life.Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the
difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests.It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand.When, three months later,
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr.Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant.A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs.Boompointer;
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger.Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr.Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew
her no more.Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome,
stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least.They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady.But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation."I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now," said the
baroness critically."But there are a few of your compatriots here,
however, and they are always amusing.You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor?That is her position day after day,
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here.Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where
it's all the other way, is it not?And there is an odd story about her
which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect.They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel.""You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one," said
Miss Trotter, smiling.I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully
ignorant at that!"Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny,
said gently, "I think you are a little severe.That was the name of her FIRST
husband.I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a
fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so
funny.said Miss Trotter after a pause, in
a still gentler voice.He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg.You will find HER very stupid,
but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women.Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject.But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons.He asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess
answered with an equal warmth."I'm glad to see you, Lester," she
said."George will take your things up-stairs.He followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at
the head of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his
personality.It seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real
personage had arrived.The attitude of her
mistress was much more complaisant.Everybody seemed to feel that
something must be done for this man.Jennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name
ran in her mind.She looked
at him now and then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her
life, an interest in a man on his own account.He was so big, so
handsome, so forceful.At the same
time she felt a little dread of him.Once she caught him looking at
her with a steady, incisive stare.She quailed inwardly, and took the
first opportunity to get out of his presence.Another time he tried to
address a few remarks to her, but she pretended that her duties called
her away.She knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was
turned, and it made her nervous.She wanted to run away from him,
although there was no very definite reason why she should do so.As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,
education, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her
unusual personality.Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar
softness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity.There was
that about her which suggested the luxury of love.He felt as if
somehow she could be reached why, he could not have said.She did not
bear any outward marks of her previous experience.There were no
evidences of coquetry about her, but still he "felt that he might."He
was inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business
called him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland
for three weeks.Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she
experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret.He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to
Mrs.Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence
in Cleveland.As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as
if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,
at breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could
see the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at
odd times when he came to Mrs.Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things
over."Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?"Jennie heard
her say to him the second day he was there."I know," he replied, "but I'm in no mood for that.I want to
browse around a little while yet."You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.He has
got all he can attend to to look after the business."She scarcely understood what she
was thinking, but this man drew her.If she had realized in what way
she would have fled his presence then and there.Now he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed
an occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic
conversations.She could not help answering him--he was pleasing
to her.Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor
searching in a locker for some linen.Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other
servants being below stairs.On this occasion he made short work of
the business.He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
thoroughly determined way."I want to talk to you," he said."I--I--" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly."I live
out on Lorrie Street."he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell
him."Thirteen fourteen," she replied
mechanically.He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous
brown ones.A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed
between them."Oh, you mustn't," she said, her fingers going nervously to her
lips."I can't see you--I--I--"

"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I?Look here"--he took her arm and
drew her slightly closer--"you and I might as well understand
each other right now.She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,
with a growing terror."I don't know," she gasped, her lips dry.He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes."I'll talk to you later," he said,
and put his lips masterfully to hers.She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but
through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking
to her."We won't do any more of
this here, but, remember, you belong to me," he said, as he turned and
walked nonchalantly down the hall.Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
mistress's room and locked the door behind her.CHAPTER XVII


The shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she
was hours in recovering herself.At first she did not understand
clearly just what had happened.Out of clear sky, as it were, this
astonishing thing had taken place.she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness
there was an answer.Though she could not explain her own emotions,
she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.There is a fate in love and a fate in fight.This strong,
intellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,
so far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely
superior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,
instinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor
serving-maid.She was his natural affinity, though he did not know
it--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
nature.Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the
highly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the
proletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for
him the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of
judgment, youth, and beauty.Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in
the back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended
to take her.He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he
ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane.For purposes of
temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,
of course, out of the question.He had no idea of making anything like
a serious proposal to a servant-girl.He had
never seen a servant quite like her.And she was lady-like and lovely
without appearing to know it.Why
shouldn't he try to seize her?Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us
try to understand him and his position.Not every mind is to be
estimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to
be judged by the drag of a single passion.We live in an age in which
the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the
spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock.The tremendous and
complicated development of our material civilization, the
multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,
and sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,
and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in
short, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements
of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic
glitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies
and stultifies the mental and moral nature.It induces a sort of
intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of
insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited.Our modern
brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and
storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
themselves daily.We are
weighed upon by too many things.It is as if the wisdom of the
infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big
minds.Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.His was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and
tendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness
of the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial
nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.Born a
Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to
accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate
superiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and
expected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he
wanted marriage on any terms.Of course the conjugal state was an
institution.True, but other nations believed in
polygamy.There were other questions that bothered him--such
questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of
government were best.In short, the whole body of things material,
social, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery
and been left but half dissected.Not a
single idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was
finally settled.In all other things he wavered, questioned,
procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe
the solution of the problems that vexed him.Yes, Lester Kane was the
natural product of a combination of elements--religious,
commercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of
liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted
freedom of thought and action.Thirty-six years of age, and apparently
a man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,
nevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by
education and environment.Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
who in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the
mines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and
mortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,
axiomatic, and witty."Do you want me to come back here next year?"he had asked of
Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor."Your father will have to
look after that," he replied."Well, my father won't look after it," Lester returned."If you
touch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands.I'm not
committing any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked
around any more."Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,
vigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and
the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to
take his clothes and leave.After that he looked his father in the eye
and told him that he was not going to school any more."I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work," he explained."There's
nothing in a classical education for me.Let me go into the office,
and I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through."Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial
honor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce
him."Come down to the office," he said; "perhaps there is something you
can do."Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had
worked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had
come to be, in a way, his personal representative.Whenever there was
a contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a
deal, Lester was the agent selected.His father trusted him
implicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of
his duties that this trust had never been impaired."Business is business," was a favorite axiom with him and the very
tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character
and personality.There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and
then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under
control.One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was
perfectly sure he had the upper hand.He drank but very little, he
thought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.Another weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed
that he was the master.If he chose to have irregular relations with
women, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay.If men
were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such
relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences
growing out of them.Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp
upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a
quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a
little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual
conduct.Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to
be mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality
intact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it
was a good one.As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been
purely selfish.But now that he had asserted his masculine
prerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to
realize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.There is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin
to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal
of happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by
which they are environed.they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the
possibility of taking a maiden to wife, "that I shall be compelled to
swallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a
pledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my
affairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a
variable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become
insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty
and interest?"These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold
contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship.They
seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their
indulgence.Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional
relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of
radical readjustment.Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it.The
innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone.He wanted
the comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more
disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it.He
would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the
needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered.Of
course he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he
had discovered her.She appealed to him on every side; he had never
known anybody quite like her.Marriage was not only impossible but
unnecessary.He had only to say "Come" and she must obey; it was her
destiny.Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately.He strolled
out to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof
that sheltered her.Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment
touched his heart.Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,
honorably?Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him
and changed his mood.No, he must possess her if he
could--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible.It was in that frame
of mind that he returned to Mrs.Bracebridge's home from his visit to
Lorrie Street.CHAPTER XVIII


Jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
complicated problem to confront.John travelled to the kitchen.Her baby, her father, her brothers,
and sisters all rose up to confront her.What was this thing that she
was doing?Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,
unsanctified relationship?How was she to explain to her family about
this man?He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about
her.He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and
position.Yet here she was parleying with him.She pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it
was best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him
where she lived.Then she resolved that she would summon up her
courage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have
anything to do with him.This last solution of the difficulty seemed
simple enough--in his absence.And she would find work where he
could not follow her up so easily.It all seemed simple enough as she
put on her things in the evening to go home.Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion
in this matter.Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to
the point.He came to the decision that he must act at once.She might
tell her family, she might tell Mrs.Bracebridge, she might leave the
city.He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,
and there was only one way to do that--talk to her.He must
persuade her to come and live with him.That soft, yielding note in her character
which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win
her without much difficulty, if he wished to try.He decided to do so,
anyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she
were still there.At six he had an opportunity to say to her,
unobserved, "I am going to walk home with you.Wait for me at the next
corner, will you?""Yes," she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing
her.She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,
that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
and this was as good an opportunity as any.At half-past six he left
the house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little
after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the
appointed spot.He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,
and curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior.It was as
if he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along.The flare of
the gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes
to make her out.A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a
great appeal in her personality.He stepped out as she neared the
corner and confronted her."Come," he said, "and get in this carriage
with me.Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of
compulsion.She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he
called out to the cabman, "Anywhere for a little while."When she was
seated beside him he began at once."Listen to me, Jennie, I want you."I have to talk to you," she replied, trying to stick to her
original line of defense.he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the
half light."I can't go on this way," she murmured nervously.I shouldn't have done what I did
this morning."You didn't do what you did this morning," he remarked,
paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.And as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.""You don't know me, but I like you.I'm crazy about you, that's
all.she replied in an agonized voice, "I can't do
anything like that, Mr.I couldn't, even if I wanted to.But I don't want to do anything wrong.He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with
even a little pity."What do you mean by you can't?""Oh, I can't tell you," she replied.But I mustn't see you any more."But you like me," he retorted.But you mustn't come near me
any more.He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a
judge.He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief
as their contact had been.And he was drawn to her, perhaps not
irrevocably, but with exceeding strength.What prevented her from
yielding, especially since she wanted to?"See here, Jennie," he replied.I don't know
what you mean by 'can't' if you want to.I'd like to have you
with me.Oh,
please don't ask me any more.The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play.Above all things
he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people.In this case he
intended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her."Listen to me," he said finally, still holding her hand."I may not
want you to do anything immediately.I
like you, and I can do a lot of things for you.Why not let us be good
friends now?Then we can talk the rest of this over later.""But I mustn't do anything wrong," she insisted."Oh no, no, no," she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her
control."Well, then, why stand out against me?I love you, I tell
you--I'm crazy about you.And I would have come again and again if necessary.I
tell you I'm crazy about you.Now tell me you'll
come with me.""No, no, no," she pleaded.I
don't want to do anything wrong."Tell me, Jennie," he said, changing the subject."Don't say'sir' to me, sweet!"I'm not'mister'
to you any more.You belong to me, little girl, me.""Listen to me, Jennie," he repeated, using his favorite expression.I
haven't had a chance to know you.You've
got to come to me eventually.And I'm not going to have you working as
a lady's maid.You can't stay in that place except for a little while.And I'm going to leave you some
money, do you hear?At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand."The families of the poor," he thought."Well, you take this from me," he insisted, drawing a purse from
his coat."And I'll see you very soon again.No, you mustn't
ask me."He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money
away."One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me," he said
soberly."You'll have to come to me eventually.I'm not going to leave you
alone.""Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.""I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?"he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of
this prize escaping him heightening his passion.And he drew her close in spite of all her protests."There," he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something
between them spoke again, and she relaxed.Tears were in her eyes, but
he did not see them."I can't," she repeated, with a sob."You're not crying, little girl,
are you?""I'll not say anything more to-night.I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you
again.I'll do anything
in reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?""Here's where you get out," he said, as the carriage drew up near
the corner.He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt
cottage curtains."Good-by," he said as she stepped out."Remember," he said, "this is just the beginning."Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed.There was no denying that she had compromised herself
irretrievably.CHAPTER XIX


The inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did
not leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;
certainly this was not the end of the affair.Kane knew that he was
deeply fascinated.She was sweeter than he had
had any idea of.Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle "no,
no, no" moved him as music might.Depend upon it, this girl was for
him, and he would get her.What did he
care about what his family or the world might think?It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time
Jennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done
spiritually.Something about her--a
warm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated
a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,
brutal immorality.She was the kind of a woman who was made for a
man--one man.All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
tenderness, service.When the one man arrived she would love him and
she would go to him.She would yield to him because he was the one man.On Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of
possible disaster.If he followed her of course he would learn all.She had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the
vague illusion that, in the end, she might escape.When she left him
she knew that he would come back.She knew, in spite of herself that
she wanted him to do so.Yet she felt that she must not yield, she
must go on leading her straitened, humdrum life.This was her
punishment for having made a mistake.She had made her bed, and she
must lie on it.The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned
after leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted
strangely with the Gerhardt home.It was a great, rambling, two-story
affair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick
and brownstone.It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost
park-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity
and of a refined luxury.Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a
tremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair
methods, but by seeing a big need and filling it.Early in life he had
realized that America was a growing country.There was going to be a
big demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he
knew that some one would have to supply them.Having founded a small
wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
wagons, and he sold them at a good profit.It was his theory that most
men were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,
and if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and
buy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man.He
believed in the measure "heaped full and running over."All through
his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of
every one who knew him."Archibald Kane," you would hear his
competitors say, "Ah, there is a fine man.This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all
healthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but
none of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and
big-hearted sire.Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was
his father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain
hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of
business life.He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with
a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue
eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips.He was a man of few
words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.He sat close to his
father as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole
blocks in an outlying section of the city.He was a strong man--a
coming man, as his father well knew.Lester, the second boy, was his father's favorite.He was not by
any means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of
the subtleties that underlie life.He was softer, more human, more
good-natured about everything.And, strangely enough, old Archibald
admired and trusted him.Perhaps he
turned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial
problem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the
mother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,
but as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the
best-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical.She
was the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of
all in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane
family should outshine every other.She was proud to think that the
family was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air
and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to
Lester!He liked her--in a way she was his favorite
sister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less
seriousness and not do the family standing any harm.Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of
age, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,
cared but little for social life.But she loved her children and her
husband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments.It
was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory.A good
woman, a good wife, and a good mother.Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at
once to his home.An old Irish servitor met him at the door.Lester," he began, joyously, "sure I'm glad to see you
back.Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're
having.Yes, yes, the family's all well.Sure your sister Amy is just
after leavin' the house with the boy.Your mother's up-stairs in her
room.Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room.In this,
which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the
south and east, sat Mrs.Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with
smoothly laid gray hair.She looked up when the door opened, laid down
the volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him."There you are, Mother," he said, putting his arms around her and
kissing her."Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester.I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again.I had
to stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons.She doesn't change any that I can see.She's just
as interested in entertaining as she ever was.""She's a bright girl," remarked his mother, recalling Mrs."She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you," replied Lester
significantly.Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family
happenings.Old Zwingle, the yard
watchman at the factory, who had been with Mr.Kane for over forty
years, had died.Lester listened
dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise."Smart" was
the word for her.She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,
fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which
contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair."Oh, there you are, Lester," she exclaimed.I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to
the powder on my nose.Lester had gripped her firmly
and kissed her soundly."I didn't brush much of it off," he said."You can always dust more
on with that puff of yours."He passed on to his own room to dress for
dinner.Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the
Kane family in the last few years.Guests had become so common that in
a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of
it.To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr.Burnett, old
friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be
a formal one.Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he
did not trouble to look him up now.He was thinking of his last two
days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.CHAPTER XX


As Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his
father in the library reading."Hello, Lester," he said, looking up from his paper over the top of
his glasses and extending his hand."Cleveland," replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
smiling."Robert tells me you've been to New York.""How did you find my old friend Arnold?""I suppose not," said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report
were a compliment to his own hardy condition."He's been a temperate
man.He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over
business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned
the guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great
Louis Quinze dining-room.He liked this homey home
atmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old
family friends.Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on
Tuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go."You know I don't dance," he returned dryly.If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you
might.""Robert's got it on me in lightness," Lester replied, airily."Be that as it may," said Lester."Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise," observed Robert,
sagely.After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with
his brother a little on business.There were some contracts coming up
for revision.He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.Louise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced."Letty Pace asked about you the other night," Louise called back
from the door."She's a nice girl, Lester," put in his father, who was standing
near the open fire."I only wish you would marry her and settle down.asked Lester jocularly--"a conspiracy?You
know I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.""And I well know it," replied his mother semi-seriously.He really could not stand for this sort
of thing any more, he told himself.And as he thought his mind
wandered back to Jennie and her peculiar "Oh no, no!"That was a type of womanhood worth
while.Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set
like a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little
girl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to
watch over her.That night in his room he composed a letter, which he
dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and
because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
weeks."MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said
nothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me.Was the impression
I gave of myself very bad?I will make it better from now on, for I
love you, little girl--I really do.There is a flower on my table
which reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.Your personality, lingering with me, is just that.You are the essence
of everything beautiful to me.It is in your power to strew flowers in
my path if you will."But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the
18th, and I shall expect to see you.I arrive Thursday night, and I
want you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon
Friday."You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call.These separations are dangerous to good
friendship.But I can't take "no" for an answer, not now."She's a remarkable girl in
her way," he thought.CHAPTER XXI


The arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and
after she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply.How did she truly feel about this
man?If she did so, what
should she say?Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which
she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,
had not seemed to involve any one but herself.Now, there seemed to be
others to consider--her family, above all, her child.The little
Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;
her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness
which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential
traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind.Gerhardt had
become very fond of her.Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct
feeling of kindliness toward her.And this readjustment of her
father's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct
herself that no pain should ever come to him again.Any new folly on
her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would
tend to injure the prospects of her little one.Her life was a
failure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do
nothing to spoil it.She wondered whether it would not be better to
write Lester and explain everything.She had told him that she did not
wish to do wrong.Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a
child, and beg him to leave her in peace.Did she really want him to take her at her word?The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.It caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to
explain, and then to tear it up.Finally, fate intervened in the
sudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an
accident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when
a letter came from Gerhardt.But instead of the customary fatherly
communication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly
remittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by
another hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received
a severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a
dipper of molten glass.The letter added that he would be home the
next morning.exclaimed William, his mouth wide
open.said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at
the floor.The possibility
that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties
which she had not the courage to contemplate.Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight.The former
heard the news with an astonished face."Did the letter say
how bad he was hurt?""Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Bass easily.I wouldn't worry like that if I
were you."The truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly
different.His brain was
not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of
things."I
can't help it, though.To think that just when we were getting along
fairly well this new calamity should be added.It seems sometimes as
if we were under a curse.When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was
her one stay.asked Jennie as she opened the door and
observed her mother's face.Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away."Pa's had his hands burned," put in Bass solemnly."He'll be home
to-morrow."Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.Instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her."Now, don't you cry, ma," she said, barely able to control herself.I know how you feel, but we'll get along.Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long
before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.And now without volition upon her part there leaped into her
consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought.What about Lester's
offer of assistance now?Somehow
it came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire
to help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when
Bass was in jail.She thought
this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,
haggard, and distraught."What a pity," she thought, "that her mother
must always suffer!Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any
real happiness?""I wouldn't feel so badly," she said, after a time."Maybe pa isn't
burned so badly as we think.Did the letter say he'd be home in the
morning?"They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details
were exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the
household."One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,"
said Jennie to Bass."No," said Bass gloomily, "you mustn't.He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;
he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in.Jennie and
her mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen
talking."I don't see what's to become of us now," said Mrs.Gerhardt at
last, completely overcome by the financial complications which this
new calamity had brought about.She looked so weak and helpless that
Jennie could hardly contain herself."Don't worry, mamma dear," she said, softly, a peculiar resolve
coming into her heart.There was comfort and ease
in it scattered by others with a lavish hand.Surely, surely
misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future
seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps."What do you suppose will become of us now?"repeated her mother,
who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
crumbled before her eyes."Why," said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,
"it will be all right.She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of
the situation to her.She must sacrifice herself; there was no other
way.Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning.He
looked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal.His cheeks
were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt.His
hands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a
picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home
from the station."By chops," he said to Bass, "that was a burn I got.I thought once
I couldn't stand the pain any longer.He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did
not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again.The
thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been
burned to the bone.The latter had been amputated at the first
joint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger
of being stiff.he added, "just at the time when I needed the money
most.Gerhardt opened the door, the
old mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.Even Bass lost control of himself for a
moment or two, but quickly recovered.The other children wept, until
Bass called a halt on all of them."Don't cry now," he said cheeringly.It
isn't so bad as all that.Bass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her
husband was home, Mrs.Though his
hands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not
otherwise injured was some consolation.He might recover the use of
his hands and be able to undertake light work again.Anyway, they
would hope for the best.When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father
and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but
she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.Never had he completely recovered from
the shame which his daughter had brought upon him.Although he wanted
to be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to
say or do."Papa," said Jennie, approaching him timidly.Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it
was unavailing.The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her
sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all
too much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly."Forgive me, papa," she pleaded, "I'm so sorry.He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that
their meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he
did."I have prayed," he said brokenly.When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.From that time, although there was always a great reserve between
them, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored
to show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old
days.But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares
and burdens to be faced.How were they to get along now with five
dollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's
presence added?Bass might have contributed more of his weekly
earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it.And so the small
sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which
now began to press very heavily.Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to
have his hands dressed daily.Either more money must come from some source or the family must beg
for credit and suffer the old tortures of want.The situation
crystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.Had he not tried to force money
on her?She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of
this proffered assistance.She sat down and wrote him a brief note.She would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come
to the house.She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled
feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the
fateful day.CHAPTER XXII


The fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new
and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence.There
was really no alternative, she thought.If she could make her family happy, if she could
give Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of
this older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,
perhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and
Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her.At seven o'clock she
went to Mrs.Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext
of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had
failed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out
of tune with the world.He had a lingering hope that a letter from
Jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from
her.He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt
depressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.After supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of
billiards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had
taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant.The
next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole
affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew
near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last
chance.Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of
an hour of the time, he went down into the parlor.Great was his
delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the
outcome of her acquiescence.He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
gratified smile on his face."So you did come after all," he said, gazing at her with the look
of one who has lost and recovered a prize."What do you mean by not
writing me?I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made
up your mind not to come at all."What's the
trouble, Jennie?Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?"Yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say."He burned his hands at the glass-works.It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
more."She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that
she was facing a crisis.I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
affairs ever since I left."He led the way into the dining-room and
selected a secluded table.He tried to divert her mind by asking her
to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so
and he had to make out the menu by himself.Then he turned to her with
a cheering air."Now, Jennie," he said, "I want you to tell me all
about your family.I got a little something of it last time, but I
want to get it straight.Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by
trade.Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.""He's a clerk in a cigar store.""I think it's twelve dollars," she replied thoughtfully."Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet.He gets three
dollars and a half."He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking
earnestly."To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like
that, Jennie," he said."I've been thinking about you a lot.There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad
one, if you'll only believe me."He paused for an inquiry, but she
made none."I thought I wouldn't," she said simply."I knew what you thought," he replied.I'm
going to 'tend to that family of yours.And I'll do it right now while
I think of it."He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar
bills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all."I want you to take
this," he said.I will see that your family
is provided for from now on.She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut
her fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time."I
want you to have it, sweet.I'm not going to
see you suffer, nor any one belonging to you."Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips."I don't know how to thank you," she said."You don't need to," he replied."The thanks are all the other
way--believe me."He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.She looked at the table, wondering what would come next."How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?""That would give you your freedom day times.""I couldn't do that," she replied."But there's so little in what
you're doing.I would be glad to
give you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which
you could use it."He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of
sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence
such as this.He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched
him."There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see," he went
on very gently."You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.Give it up and come with me down
to New York; I'll take good care of you.As
far as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them
any more.You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any
style you please.He paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,
her dear mother.Gerhardt had been talking of
this very thing--a nice home.If they could just have a larger
house, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she
would be.In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the
discomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would
be so happy.She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in
spirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion.It had been a
happy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the
family.He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:

"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?""It would be very nice," she said, "but it can't be done now.Papa would want to know all about where I was
going."Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with
Mrs."There couldn't be any objection to
that, could there?""Not if they didn't find out," she said, her eyes opening in
amazement.Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long
trips.Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to
go--and then go?"She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible.Then she
looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant
possible motherhood for her again.The tragedy of giving birth to a
child--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least
under the same conditions.She could not bring herself to tell him
about Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection."I--" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
and then stopping.He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.He reached over and laid his strong
brown one on top of it."I couldn't have a baby," she said, finally, and looked down.He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency
under conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of
the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she
had not occupied until that moment."You're a great girl, Jennie," he said.You don't need to have a
child unless you want to, and I don't want you to."He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.You think I know,
don't you?"But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.There wouldn't
be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time.But there won't be--don't worry."Not for worlds could she have met his
eyes."Look here, Jennie," he said, after a time."You care for me, don't
you?You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care
for you?I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth.I want you to do it
quickly.I know how difficult this family business is, but you can
arrange it.We'll pretend a courtship, anything you
like--only come now.""You don't mean right away, do you?"Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would
think anything about it."It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood," she replied
thoughtfully."I know it, but you can come."Won't you wait a little while?""Not a day, sweet, that I can help."Yes," she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of
affection.CHAPTER XXIII


The business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not
so difficult as it first appeared.Jennie proposed to tell her mother
the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except
that she was going with Mrs.He
might question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home
that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she
was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and
hat."When we get to New York I am
going to get you some real things," he told her."I am going to show
you what you can be made to look like."He had all the purchased
articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel.Then he arranged
to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in
the afternoon.Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received
her with her usual affectionate greeting."No," she said, "I'm not tired."Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma.She
paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.So many things had
happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new
calamity."You haven't lost your place, have you?""No," replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,
"but I'm going to leave it.""Why, when did you decide to do
that?""Yes, I do, mamma.I've got something I want to tell you.There isn't any way we can make things come
out right.I have found some one who wants to help us.He says he
loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.You wouldn't do
anything like that after all that's happened."I've thought it all out," went on Jennie, firmly.He
wants me to go with him, and I'd better go.He will take a new house
for us when we come back and help us to get along.No one will ever
have me as a wife--you know that."I thought I'd better not tell him
about her.She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.""I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie," said
her mother."Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?""I thought maybe that she could be kept here," suggested Jennie,
"until she's old enough to go to school.Then maybe I could send her
somewhere.""She might," assented her mother; "but don't you think it would be
better to tell him now?He won't think any the worse of you.""I don't want
her to be brought into it.""Oh, it's been almost two months now.""And you never said anything about him," protested Mrs."I didn't know that he cared for me this way," said Jennie
defensively."Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?"You can't go and not have
your father find out.""I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs.Papa can't
object to my going with her."Gerhardt, with her
imaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new
and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life.He was
wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home."And he gave me this," put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive
psychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood.She opened her
dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she
placed the money in her mother's hands.Here was the relief for all her
woes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small
package of green and yellow bills.If there were plenty of money in
the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and
Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for
Vesta."Do you think he might ever want to marry you?""I don't know," replied Jennie "he might."Well," said her mother after a long pause, "if you're going to
tell your father you'd better do it right away.He'll think it's
strange as it is."Her mother had acquiesced from
sheer force of circumstances.She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to
be for the best."I'll help you out with it," her mother had
concluded, with a little sigh.The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming
nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions.The children were
also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the
falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough."How long do you think you'll be gone?""About two or three weeks," she replied."That's a nice trip," he said."I came through New York in 1844.It
was a small place then compared to what it is now."Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,
going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her."So you came," he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the
ladies' parlor."You are my niece," he went on."I have engaged H room for you near
mine.I'll call for the key, and you go dress.When you're ready I'll
have the trunk sent to the depot.The train leaves at one
o'clock."She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,
smoked, and finally knocked at her door.She replied by opening to him, fully clad."You look charming," he said with a smile.She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught.The whole
process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had
been hard on her.He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down
the hall.He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these
simple clothes--the best she had ever had.They reached the depot after a short carriage ride.The
accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed
just enough time to make the train.When they settled themselves in a
Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his
part.He had succeeded in
what he had started out to do.As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the
fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully.There were the
forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains
of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,
their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and
yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain.Jennie noted
one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where
they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and began silently to cry."I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?"said

Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading."Come, come," he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her.You'll never get along if
you act that way."She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him
with strange sympathies."Don't cry," he continued soothingly; "everything will be all
right.Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her
eyes."You don't want to give way like that," he continued."It doesn't
do you any good.I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears
won't help it any.It isn't as if you were going away for good, you
know.You care for me, don't
you, sweet?"Yes," she said, and managed to smile back at him.Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking
of Vesta.It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret
from one who was already very dear to her.She knew that she ought to
tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful
necessity.Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it."I'll have to tell him something," she thought with a sudden
upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty."If I
don't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find
it out he would never forgive me.He might turn me out, and then where
would I go?She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror
sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving
soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and
comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an
avenging Nemesis.She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked
up."Well, have you washed all your sins away?"The touch of fact in it made it
slightly piquant.He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,
the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing
dwelling in her mind."I'll have to do it shortly," she thought, and
consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage
before long.Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important
question in Lester's mind as to where he should stop.New York was a
very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people
who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take
chances.Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more
exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and
they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,
so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same
world that she had inhabited before.Kane was no lover of vulgar
display.The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always
simple and elegant.He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought
for her with discrimination and care.And Jennie, a woman, took a keen
pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished
upon her.Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's
daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure
of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat
and upon her arms?Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?And Lester had promised
that her mother would share in it.Tears sprang to her eyes at the
thought.It was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
make her look like some one truly worthy of im.He exercised his most
careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself.People turned
in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at
Jennie."A stunning woman that man has with him," was a frequent
comment.Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life
or her sense of perspective or proportion.She felt as though life
were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after
a time.There was no pretty vanity in her bosom.Lester realized this
as he watched her."You're a big woman, in your way," he said.Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to
now."He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his
family, should they chance to hear about it.If he should decide to
take a home in Chicago or St.Louis (there was such a thought running
in his mind) could he maintain it secretly?He was
half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as
to her future course of action."You ought to find some way of
introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father," he said.Then if you tell him you're going
to marry me he'll think nothing of it."Jennie thought of Vesta, and
trembled inwardly.But perhaps her father could be induced to remain
silent.Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the
clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them
home when she reached there."There won't be any trouble about this
other stuff," he said."I'll have it cared for until we make some
other arrangement."It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
strategist.Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.She had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs.In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her
mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some
one who liked her.She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and
her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his
peace.Jennie must be given an opportunity
to better herself.Of
course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs.Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order
that she might look for something better, something at which he could
make more money.CHAPTER XXIV


The problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his
business duties.He was heartily interested in the immense plant,
which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its
conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as
to either his father or his brother.He liked to feel that he was a
vital part of this great and growing industry.When he saw freight
cars going by on the railroads labelled "The Kane Manufacturing
Company--Cincinnati" or chanced to notice displays of the
company's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the
different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction.It
was something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so
distinguished, so honestly worth while.This was all very well, but
now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal
existence--in a word, there was Jennie.He was conscious as he
rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which
might involve disagreeable consequences.He was a little afraid of his
father's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent
business man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private
life.Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,
he was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn
any trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,
recommended to his conscience.How he reasoned Lester did not
know--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which
could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow
his brother managed to do it."He's got a Scotch Presbyterian
conscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance."Lester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately
measured.Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his
positions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him.He
was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
sophisticatedly.The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far
apart.Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not
trust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree
as to how life and its affairs should be conducted.Lester had a
secret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the
almighty dollar.Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were
reprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later.In the
business they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance
with the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain
minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the
wind blew.Lester was for building up trade through friendly
relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors.Robert was
for pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and
offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these
troubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash.One or the other
would have to get out or perhaps both."If only you two boys could
agree!"Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on
the subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.Archibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to
get married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,
that he was sure of."The world expects it of a man in your position," his father had
argued from time to time."It makes for social solidity and prestige.You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family.Where will you
be when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any
home?""Well, if the right woman came along," said Lester, "I suppose I'd
marry her."No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women.You
can surely find some one if you try.I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;
it can't come to any good.""There, father, let it go now.I'll come
around some time, no doubt.I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to
water."The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore
point with him.He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of
affairs.The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any
permanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this
time.Of course he
would not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences.But he
must be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks.What a scandal if it were ever found out!Could he
install her in a nice home somewhere near the city?Could he take her along on his
numerous business journeys?This first one to New York had been
successful.He turned the question over in his
mind.Louis, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago would be best after all.He went to these places
frequently, and particularly to Chicago.He decided finally that it
should be Chicago if he could arrange it.He could always make excuses
to run up there, and it was only a night's ride.The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.After two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would
be all right for him to call and see her.She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had
secured a position in a store at four dollars a week.He smiled as he
thought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed
to him.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom."She's the best I've come across
yet."He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her
place of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening.He
was anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over
with as quickly as possible.When he did call the shabbiness of the
house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but
somehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever.Gerhardt came in the
front-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands
with him, as did also Mrs.Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention
to them.The old German appeared to him to be merely
commonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
capacities in his father's factory.After some desultory conversation
Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.Jennie put
on her hat, and together they departed.As a matter of fact, they went
to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.When she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it
nothing amiss.CHAPTER XXV


A month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to
marry her.His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it
seemed natural enough.He did
not know just how this might be.Lester
seemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,
why not?If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,
why not a business man?"Has
she told him about Vesta?"Do you think he
wants her if he knows?That's what comes of such conduct in the first
place.Now she has to slip around like a thief.The child cannot even
have an honest name."Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding.His life
seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well
enough to hunt up another job as watchman.He wanted to get out of
this mess of deception and dishonesty.A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had
written her to join him in Chicago.He was not feeling well, and could
not come to Cleveland.The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie
was going away to be married to Mr.Gerhardt flared up at this,
and his suspicions were again aroused.But he could do nothing but
grumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he
was sure.When the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without
saying farewell to her father.He was out looking for work until late
in the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to
leave for the station."I will write a note to him when I get there,"
she said."Lester will take a
better house for us soon," she went on hopefully.The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and
the new one had begun.The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's
generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the
children and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser.Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities
and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an
enlarged purse permitted.But, after Jennie had
been in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that
Lester wanted them to take a new home.This letter was shown to
Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene.He
frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity.If he had
not married her why should he want to help them?Perhaps Jennie was
well married after all.Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high
station in life, and was now able to help the family.Gerhardt almost
concluded to forgive her everything once and for all.The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie
returned to Cleveland to help her mother move.Together they searched
the streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one.A
house of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was
secured and suitably furnished.There were comfortable fittings for
the dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom
sets complete for each room.The kitchen was supplied with every
convenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts
had never enjoyed before.Altogether the house was attractive, though
plain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be
comfortable in it.When the time came for the actual moving Mrs.Gerhardt was fairly
beside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her
dreams?All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,
and now it had come.A new house, new furniture, plenty of
room--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of
it!Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and
bureaus and whatnots."Dear, dear, isn't this nice!"Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction
without emotion, but there were tears in her eyes.She was so glad for
her mother's sake.She could have kissed Lester's feet for his
goodness to her family.Gerhardt, Martha, and
Veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things.At the sight of the
large rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise
of a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture
standing about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of
delight.George rubbed his feet over
the new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture
critically.Gerhardt roved to and fro
like a person in a dream.She could not believe that these bright
bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were
actually hers.Although he tried hard not to show it,
he, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment.The sight
of an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the
finishing touch.He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new
carpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a
white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the
bright, clean kitchen.We want to be careful now
not to break anything.It's so easy to scratch things up, and then
it's all over."CHAPTER XXVI


It would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
followed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an
abject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,
based, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the
generosity (through her) of her distant husband.Lester was seen now
and then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes
coming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best
rooms of the second floor.There were hurried trips on her
part--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.One of his favorite pastimes was to engage
quarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt.Clemens,
Saratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy
the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife.There were other times
when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing
her for a day.All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see
how he could remedy it at this time.He was not sure as yet that he
really wanted to.The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of
affairs was peculiar.At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it
seemed natural enough.No one had seen
her marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry
herself with the air of one who holds that relationship.Still, she
never went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his
relatives ever came near her.Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the
money which had first blinded them, was peculiar.He really did not
carry himself like a married man.There were
weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes.There
were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.Then there were the long periods in which she absented
herself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real
relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some
business judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was
suspicious.He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and
intuitively he felt that things were not right.George, nineteen, who
had gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking
forward to a career in that field, was also restless.Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were
William and Veronica.Each was offered an opportunity to study
indefinitely; but there was unrest with life.The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for
themselves.Gerhardt himself finally concluded
that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.He wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if
he could--but the worst had already been done.It depended on the
man now, he knew that.Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval
would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its
fortuitous solutions.Although stout
and formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years
become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,
coupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it
had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to
culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning.She
became decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the
few tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it
was very hard for her to climb stairs."I'm not feeling well," she
said."I think I'm going to be sick."Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
watering-place, but Mrs."I don't think it would
do any good," she said.She sat about or went driving with her
daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her."I don't like
to get sick in the fall," she said."The leaves coming down make me
think I am never going to get well."said Jennie; but she felt frightened,
nevertheless.How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it
was feared the end was near.Bass, who had thought of getting married
and getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.Gerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant
of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster.Jennie, too
inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her
mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her.Hoping in spite
of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of
patience, waiting and serving.The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days
of unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all
the family went about on tiptoe.Gerhardt passed away with her
dying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of
consciousness that life vouchsafed her.Jennie stared into her eyes
with a yearning horror.Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down
by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the
family.Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in
town for some time.Martha, whose views of life had broadened and
hardened, was anxious to get out also.She felt that a sort of stigma
attached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she
remained there.Martha looked to the public schools as a source of
income; she was going to be a teacher.Gerhardt alone scarcely knew
which way to turn.He was again at work as a night watchman.Jennie
found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
into tears herself.she pleaded, "it isn't as bad as
that.You will always have a home--you know that--as long as
I have anything.He really did not want to go with her."It
isn't that," he continued.It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally
left, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,
Veronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child.Of course
Lester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had
never seen the little girl.During the short periods in which he
deigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background.There
was a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and
concealment was easy.Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his
meals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of
the suite.He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of
the other members of the family.He was perfectly willing to shake
hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
perfunctory words only.It was generally understood that the child
must not appear, and so it did not.There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an
affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic.During that first year
in Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried
Vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks.When
she got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened
securely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she
was able to take a few steps of her own accord.When she actually
reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her
to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly.By some strange
leading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on
conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the
tendons of his heart.He loved this little outcast ardently,
hopefully.She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and
Gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education
in religious matters.Was it not he who had insisted that the infant
should be baptized?"Say 'Our Father,'" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he
had her alone with him."Ow Fowvaw," was her vowel-like interpretation of his words."'Ooh ah in aven,'" repeated the child.Gerhardt, overhearing
the little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels."Because I want she should learn the Christian faith," returned
Gerhardt determinedly.If she don't
begin now she never will know them."Many of her husband's religious
idiosyncrasies were amusing to her.At the same time she liked to see
this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing.If
he were only not so hard, so narrow at times.He made himself a
torment to himself and to every one else.On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to
take her for her first little journeys in the world."Come, now," he
would say, "we will go for a little walk."Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these
days Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete.Taking her by
the hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot
and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling
steps.One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started
on one of their walks.Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;
the birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making
the best of their brief span of life.Sparrows chirped in the road;
robins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the
cottages.Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of
nature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond.exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby.Her hand
was up, and her eyes were wide open."Yes," said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly
discovered this marvelous creature."It is going to look for a worm now.We
will see if we cannot find its nest.I think I saw a nest in one of
these trees."He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned
nest that he had observed on a former walk."Here it is," he said at
last, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten
remnant of a home was still clinging."Here, come now, see," and he
lifted the baby up at arm's length."See," said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his
free hand, "nest.repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of
her own."Yes," said Gerhardt, putting her down again."That was a wren's
nest.Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,
she wondering with the wide wonder of a child.When they had gone a
block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had
been reached.And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,
intelligence, and vivacity.Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions
she asked, the puzzles she pronounced."What is it she doesn't want to know?From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her
down at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief
solace and comfort of his days.Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have
found his life hard indeed to bear.CHAPTER XXVII


For three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of
Jennie.Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church
and of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was
perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment.His interest
in the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he
had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which
had himself as the object.He looked on his father's business
organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get
control of it; but he saw no way of doing so.Robert's interests were
always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther
apart than ever in their ideas and aims.Lester had thought once or
twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself
with another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could
conscientiously do this.Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand
a year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was
vice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside
investments.He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as
Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five
thousand, he had nothing.Robert, on the other hand, was
unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,
in addition to his future interest in the business, which both
brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.Robert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters
a sixth.It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,
seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.The old gentleman might do anything or
nothing.The probabilities were that he would be very fair and
liberal.At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the
game of life.There comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and
"takes stock" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with
his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material.This
time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when
the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins
to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
itself to everything.There is a deadening thought of uselessness
which creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been
best expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.he used to say to himself, "whether I live at the White House,
or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?"But in the very question
was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had
failed to realize in his own career.The White House represented the
rise and success of a great public character.His home and the Grand
Pacific were what had come to him without effort.He decided for the time being--it was about the period of the
death of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to
rehabilitate himself.He would cut out idling--these numerous
trips with Jennie had cost him considerable time.If his brother could find avenues of financial
profit, so could he.He would endeavor to assert his
authority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the
business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything.Should
he forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him.Somehow he did not see how it
could be done.It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked
to admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself.He liked
her--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.He didn't see how he
could desert her very well.Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.His brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established
paint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially
for the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was
growing and had a promising future.Lester, knowing the members of the
Eastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations
with the house, was in opposition.His father at first seemed to agree
with Lester.But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical
way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face."We
can't go on forever," he said, "standing by old friends, just because
father here has dealt with them, or you like them.The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more
and stronger competition.""It's just as father feels about it," said Lester at last."I have
no deep feeling in the matter.It won't hurt me one way or the other.You say the house is going to profit eventually.I've stated the
arguments on the other side.""I'm inclined to think Robert is right," said Archibald Kane
calmly."Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked
out.""Well, we won't have any more discussion about it
then," he said.He rose and strolled out of the office.The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering
pulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably.It wasn't
much but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's
business acumen was even more irritating.He was beginning to wonder
whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution
of the property.Had he heard anything about his entanglement with
Jennie?Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with
either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
concerned.He was still the investigator of
propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the
trusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being
worsted.He thought about this, but could reach no
conclusion.Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for
reorganization in the executive department of the business.He
proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage
warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of
their completed stock there.Buyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily
reached and dealt with there.It would be a big advertisement for the
house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.Kane
senior and Lester immediately approved of this.Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
construction of the new buildings.It would probably be advisable for
him to reside in Chicago a part of the time.The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from
Cincinnati, largely if not entirely.It was dignified and not
unrepresentative of his standing in the company.He could live in
Chicago and he could have Jennie with him.The scheme he had for
taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty."I'm sure we'll get good results from this all
around," he said.As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to
Chicago immediately.He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together
they selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite
of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to
suit his taste.He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a
bachelor.He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.There were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and
the hotels.To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically
ideal.Of course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
the Gerhardt family to a climax.Probably the home would be broken up,
but Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically.He was an old
man, and it did not matter much where he lived.Bass, Martha, and
George were already taking care of themselves.Veronica and William
were still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding
them with a neighbor.The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was
Vesta.It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the
child with her.he asked her, when the day of her
contemplated departure had been set."No; but I'm going to soon," she assured him."It's too bad," he went on.God will punish you,
I'm afraid.I'm getting old--otherwise
I would keep her.There is no one here all day now to look after her
right, as she should be.""I know," said Jennie weakly.I'm going
to have her live with me soon.I won't neglect her--you know
that.""But the child's name," he insisted.Soon
in another year she goes to school.People will want to know who she
is.Jennie understood well enough that it couldn't.The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant
separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's
very existence.It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did
not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise.Vesta had good
clothes, everything she needed.Jennie
hoped to give her a good education.If only she had told the truth to
Lester in the first place.Now it was almost too late, and yet she
felt that she had acted for the best.Finally she decided to find some
good woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a
consideration.In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she
came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she
required--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty.She was a widow,
doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
which she should give her whole time to Vesta.The latter was to go to
kindergarten when a suitable one should be found.She was to have toys
and kindly attention, and Mrs.Olsen was to inform Jennie of any
change in the child's health.Jennie
