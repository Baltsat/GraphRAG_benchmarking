Leyds may be right, and the Johannesburg population safe in
case of war, we advise that, at the first act of war on the English
side, the women and children, and well-disposed persons of this town, be
given twenty-four hours to leave, and then the whole place be shot down;
in the event, we repeat--which God forbid!--of war coming."If, indeed, there must be shooting, then it will be on account of
seditious words and deeds of Johannesburg agitators and the
co-shareholders in Cape Town and London, and the struggle will be
promoted for no other object than the possession of the gold.Well,
then, let such action be taken that the perpetrators of these turbulent
proceedings shall, if caught, be thrown into the deep shafts of their
mines, with the debris of the batteries for a costly shroud, and that
the whole of Johannesburg, with the exception of the Afrikander wards,
be converted into a gigantic rubbish heap to serve as a mighty tombstone
for the shot-down authors of a monstrous deed."If it be known that these valuable buildings and the lives of the
wire-pullers are the price of the mines, then people will take good heed
before the torch of war is set alight.Friendly talks and protests are
no use with England.Let force and rough violence be opposed to the
intrigues and plots of Old England, and only then will the Boer remain
master."It is on Saturday nights that the bitterness of the Uitlander population
is most noticeable, since then the workers from the mines along the
Randt gather in the city and discuss their grievances, which then become
magnified with every additional glass of liquor.It is then that the
city streets and places of amusement and entertainment are crowded with
a throng that finds relaxation by abusing the Boers.The theatre
audiences laugh loudest at the coarsest jests made at the expense of the
Boers, and the bar-room crowds talk loudest when the Boers are the
subject of discussion.The abuse continues even when the not-too-sober
Uitlander, wheeled homeward at day-break by his faithful Zulu 'ricksha
boy, casts imprecations upon the Boer policeman who is guarding his
property.Johannesburg is one of the most expensive places of residence in the
world.Situated in the interior of the continent, thousands of miles
distant from the sources of food and supplies, it is natural that
commodities should be high in price.Almost all food stuffs are carried
thither from America, Europe, and Australia, and consequently the
original cost is trebled by the addition of carriage and customs duties.The most common articles of food are twice as costly as in America,
while such commodities as eggs, imported from Madeira, frequently are
scarce at a dollar a dozen.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.In fact, but for the timely
warning of Yuba Bill by Mr.Tarbox, the coach might have crashed into
the tree at that dangerous point, and an accident ensued more disastrous
to life and limb than the robbery itself."The sudden and unmistakable delight that expanded the old woman's mouth
was so convincing that it might have given Brice a tinge of remorse over
the success of his stratagem, had he not been utterly absorbed in his
purpose.The old man appeared from some back door with a promptness that proved
his near proximity, and glanced angrily at Brice until he caught sight
of his wife's face."Read that again, young feller," she said exultingly.Brice re-read the paragraph aloud for Mr."That 'ar 'Hiram Tarbox, Esquire,' means YOU, Hiram," she gasped, in
delighted explanation.Hiram seized the paper, read the paragraph himself, spread out the whole
page, examined it carefully, and then a fatuous grin began slowly to
extend itself over his whole face, invading his eyes and ears, until
the heavy, harsh, dogged lines of his nostrils and jaws had utterly
disappeared.Yet he hesitated a moment as he added,
"I would like to see Miss Flora."His hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion
than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference.With their
knowledge and pride in their relative's fascinations they felt it could
have but one meaning!Hiram wiped his mouth with his hand, assumed a
demure expression, glanced at his wife, and answered:--

"She ain't here now."But the true lover
holds a talisman potent with old and young.Tarbox felt a sneaking
maternal pity for this suddenly stricken Strephon."She's gone home," she added more gently--"went at sun-up this mornin'."Then she said--a little
in her old manner--"Her uncle's."The astonishment in their faces presently darkened into suspicion again."Ef that's your little game," began Hiram, with a lowering brow--

"I have no little game but to see her and speak with her," said Brice
boldly."I am alone and unarmed, as you see," he continued, pointing
to his empty belt and small dispatch bag slung on his shoulder, "and
certainly unable to do any one any harm.I am willing to take what risks
there are.And as no one knows of my intention, nor of my coming here,
whatever might happen to me, no one need know it.There was that hopeful determination in his manner that overrode their
resigned doggedness."Ef we knew how to direct you thar," said the old
woman cautiously, "ye'd be killed outer hand afore ye even set eyes on
the girl.The house is in a holler with hills kept by spies; ye'd be a
dead man as soon as ye crossed its boundary."interrupted her husband quickly, in
querulous warning."Wot are ye talkin' about?"I ain't goin' to let that young feller
get popped off without a show, or without knowin' jest wot he's got to
tackle, nohow ye kin fix it!And can't ye see he's bound to go, whatever
ye says?"Tarbox saw this fact plainly in Brice's eyes, and hesitated."The most that I kin tell ye," he said gloomily, "is the way the gal
takes when she goes from here, but how far it is, or if it ain't a
blind, I can't swar, for I hevn't bin thar myself, and Harry never comes
here but on an off night, when the coach ain't runnin' and thar's no
travel."He stopped suddenly and uneasily, as if he had said too much."Thar ye go, Hiram, and ye talk of others gabblin'!So ye might as well
tell the young feller how that thar ain't but one way, and that's the
way Harry takes, too, when he comes yer oncet in an age to talk to his
own flesh and blood, and see a Christian face that ain't agin him!""Ye know whar the tree was thrown down on the
road," he said at last."The mountain rises straight up on the right side of the road, all hazel
brush and thorn--whar a goat couldn't climb."for thar's a little trail, not a foot wide, runs up
from the road for a mile, keepin' it in view all the while, but bein'
hidden by the brush.Ye kin see everything from thar, and hear a
teamster spit on the road.""Go on," said Brice impatiently."Then it goes up and over the ridge, and down the other side into a
little gulch until it comes to the canyon of the North Fork, where the
stage road crosses over the bridge high up.The trail winds round the
bank of the Fork and comes out on the LEFT side of the stage road about
a thousand feet below it.That's the valley and hollow whar Harry lives,
and that's the only way it can be found.For all along the LEFT of the
stage road is a sheer pitch down that thousand feet, whar no one kin git
up or down.""I understand," said Brice, with sparkling eyes."I'll find my way all
right.""And when ye git thar, look out for yourself!"put in the woman
earnestly."Ye may have regular greenhorn's luck and pick up Flo afore
ye cross the boundary, for she's that bold that when she gets lonesome
o' stayin' thar she goes wanderin' out o' bounds.""Hev ye any weppin,--any shootin'-iron about ye?"asked Tarbox, with a
latent suspicion.The young man smiled, and again showed his empty belt."I ain't sure ef that ain't the safest thing arter all with a shot like
Harry," remarked the old man grimly.It was clearly a leave-taking, and Brice, warmly thanking them both,
returned to the road.It was not far to the scene of the obstruction, yet but for Tarbox's
timely hint, the little trail up the mountain side would have escaped
his observation.Ascending, he soon found himself creeping along a
narrow ledge of rock, hidden from the road that ran fifty yards below by
a thick network growth of thorn and bramble, which still enabled him to
see its whole parallel length.Perilous in the extreme to any hesitating
foot, at one point, directly above the obstruction, the ledge itself
was missing--broken away by the fall of the tree from the forest crest
higher up.For an instant Brice stood dizzy and irresolute before the
gap.Looking down for a foothold, his eye caught the faint imprint of
a woman's shoe on a clayey rock projecting midway of the chasm.It must
have been the young girl's footprint made that morning, for the narrow
toe was pointed in the direction she would go!Where SHE could pass
should he shrink from going?Without further hesitation he twined his
fingers around the roots above him, and half swung, half pulled himself
along until he once more felt the ledge below him.From time to time, as he went on along the difficult track, the narrow
little toe-print pointed the way to him, like an arrow through the
wilds.It was a pleasant thought, and yet a perplexing one.Would he
have undertaken this quest just to see her?Would he be content with
that if his other motive failed?For as he made his way up to the ridge
he was more than once assailed by doubts of the practical success of his
enterprise.In the excitement of last night, and even the hopefulness
of the early morning, it seemed an easy thing to persuade the vain and
eccentric highwayman that their interests might be identical, and
to convince him that his, Brice's, assistance to recover the stolen
greenbacks and insure the punishment of the robber, with the possible
addition of a reward from the express company, would be an inducement
for them to work together.The risks that he was running seemed to his
youthful fancy to atone for any defects in his logic or his plans.Yet
as he crossed the ridge, leaving the civilized highway behind him,
and descended the narrow trail, which grew wilder at each step, his
arguments seemed no longer so convincing.He now hurried forward,
however, with a feverish haste to anticipate the worst that might befall
him.The trail grew more intricate in the deep ferns; the friendly little
footprint had vanished in this primeval wilderness.As he pushed through
the gorge, he could hear at last the roar of the North Fork forcing its
way through the canyon that crossed the gorge at right angles.At last
he reached its current, shut in by two narrow precipitous walls that
were spanned five hundred feet above by the stage road over a perilous
bridge.As he approached the gloomy canyon, he remembered that the
river, seen from above, seemed to have no banks, but to have cut its way
through the solid rock.He found, however, a faint ledge made by caught driftwood from the
current and the debris of the overhanging cliffs.Again the narrow
footprint on the ooze was his guide.At last, emerging from the canyon,
a strange view burst upon his sight.The river turned abruptly to the
right, and, following the mountain side, left a small hollow completely
walled in by the surrounding heights.To his left was the ridge he had
descended from on the other side, and he now understood the singular
detour he had made.He was on the other side of the stage road also,
which ran along the mountain shelf a thousand feet above him.The wall,
a sheer cliff, made the hollow inaccessible from that side.Little hills
covered with buckeye encompassed it.It looked like a sylvan retreat,
and yet was as secure in its isolation and approaches as the outlaw's
den that it was.He was gazing at the singular prospect when a shot rang in the air.It
seemed to come from a distance, and he interpreted it as a signal.But
it was followed presently by another; and putting his hand to his hat to
keep it from falling, he found that the upturned brim had been pierced
by a bullet.He stopped at this evident hint, and, taking his dispatch
bag from his shoulder, placed it significantly upon a boulder, and
looked around as if to await the appearance of the unseen marksman.The rifle shot rang out again, the bag quivered, and turned over with a
bullet hole through it!He took out his white handkerchief and waved it.Another shot followed,
and the handkerchief was snapped from his fingers, torn from corner
to corner.A feeling of desperation and fury seized him; he was being
played with by a masked and skillful assassin, who only waited until
it pleased him to fire the deadly shot!But this time he could see the
rifle smoke drifting from under a sycamore not a hundred yards away.He
set his white lips together, but with a determined face and unfaltering
step walked directly towards it.In another moment he believed and
almost hoped that all would be over.With such a marksman he would not
be maimed, but killed outright.He had not covered half the distance before a man lounged out from
behind the tree carelessly shouldering his rifle.He was tall but
slightly built, with an amused, critical manner, and nothing about him
to suggest the bloodthirsty assassin.He met Brice halfway, dropping his
rifle slantingly across his breast with his hands lightly grasping the
lock, and gazed at the young man curiously."You look as if you'd had a big scare, old man, but you've clear grit
for all that!"he said, with a critical and reassuring smile."Now,
what are you doing here?Stay," he continued, as Brice's parched lips
prevented him from replying immediately.His glance suddenly shifted, and swept
past Brice over the ground beyond him to the entrance of the hollow, but
his smile returned as he apparently satisfied himself that the young man
was alone."I want to see Snapshot Harry," said Brice, with an effort.His voice
came back more slowly than his color, but that was perhaps hurried by a
sense of shame at his physical weakness."What you want is a drop o' whiskey," said the stranger good humoredly,
taking his arm, "and we'll find it in that shanty just behind the tree."To Brice's surprise, a few steps in that direction revealed a fair-sized
cabin, with a slight pretentiousness about it of neatness, comfort, and
picturesque effect, far superior to the Tarbox shanty.A few flowers
were in boxes on the window--signs, as Brice fancied, of feminine taste.When they reached the threshold, somewhat of this quality was also
visible in the interior.When Brice had partaken of the whiskey,
the stranger, who had kept silence, pointed to a chair, and said
smilingly:--

"I am Henry Dimwood, alias Snapshot Harry, and this is my house.""I came to speak with you about the robbery of greenbacks from the coach
last night," began Brice hurriedly, with a sudden access of hope at his
reception."I mean, of course,"--he stopped and hesitated,--"the actual
robbery before YOU stopped us."said Harry, springing to his feet, "do you mean to say YOU knew
it?"Brice's heart sank, but he remained steadfast and truthful."Yes," he
said, "I knew it when I handed down the box.I saw that the lock had
been forced, but I snapped it together again.Perhaps I
should have warned you, but I am solely to blame."asked the highwayman, with singular
excitement."Not at the time, I give you my word!"replied Brice quickly, thinking
only of loyalty to his old comrade."I never told him till we reached
the station."Brice remembered Bill's uncontrollable merriment, but replied vaguely
and diplomatically, "He was certainly astonished."A laugh gathered in Snapshot Harry's eyes which at last overspread his
whole face, and finally shook his frame as he sat helplessly down again.Then, wiping his eyes, he said in a shaky voice:--

"It would have been sure death to have trusted myself near that station,
but I think I'd have risked it just to have seen Bill's face when you
told him!Bill,
who was never caught napping!Bill, who only wanted supreme control
of things to wipe me off the face of the earth!Bill, who knew how
everything was done, and could stop it if he chose, and then to have
been ROBBED TWICE IN ONE EVENING BY MY GANG!Yuba Bill and
his rotten old coach were GONE THROUGH TWICE INSIDE HALF AN HOUR by the
gang!""Afterwards, my young friend--like Yuba Bill--afterwards.""It was done by two sneaking hounds," he
said sharply; "one whom I suspected before, and one, a new hand, a pal
of his.They were detached to watch the coach and be satisfied that the
greenbacks were aboard, for it isn't my style to 'hold up' except
for something special.They were to take seats on the coach as far as
Ringwood Station, three miles below where we held you up, and to get out
there and pass the word to us that it was all right.They didn't; that
made us a little extra careful, seeing something was wrong, but never
suspecting THEM.We found out afterwards that they got one of my scouts
to cut down that tree, saying it was my orders and a part of our game,
calculating in the stoppage and confusion to collar the swag and get off
with it.Without knowing it, YOU played into their hands by going into
Tarbox's cabin.""They forgot one thing," continued Snapshot Harry grimly."They forgot
that half an hour before and half an hour after a stage is stopped we
have that road patrolled, every foot of it.While I was opening the box
in the brush, the two fools, sneaking along the road, came slap upon one
of my patrols, and then tried to run for it.One was dropped, but before
he was plugged full of holes and hung up on a tree, he confessed, and
said the other man who escaped had the greenbacks.""Then they are lost," he said bitterly."Not unless he eats them--as he may want to do before I'm done on him,
for he must either starve or come out.That road is still watched by my
men from Tarbox's cabin to the bridge.He's there somewhere, and can't
get forward or backward.he said, rising and going to the door."That road," he pointed to the stage road,--a narrow ledge flanked on
one side by a precipitous mountain wall, and on the other by an equally
precipitate descent,--"is his limit and tether, and he can't escape on
either side.""There is but one entrance to it,--the way you came, and that is guarded
too.From the time you entered it until you reached the bottom, you were
signaled here from point to point!I merely
gave YOU a hint of what might have happened to you, if you were up to
any little game!Thus challenged, Brice plunged with youthful hopefulness into his plan;
if, as he voiced it, it seemed to him a little extravagant, he was
buoyed up by the frankness of the highwayman, who also had treated
the double robbery with a levity that seemed almost as extravagant.He
suggested that they should work together to recover the money; that the
express company should know that the unprecedented stealthy introduction
of robbers in the guise of passengers was not Snapshot Harry's method,
and he repudiated it as unmanly and unsportsmanlike; and that, by using
his superior skill and knowledge of the locality to recover the money
and deliver the culprit into the company's hands, he would not only earn
the reward that they should offer, but that he would evoke a sentiment
that all Californians would understand and respect.The highwayman
listened with a tolerant smile, but, to Brice's surprise, this appeal
to his vanity touched him less than the prospective punishment of the
thief."It would serve the d----d hound right," he muttered, "if, instead of
being shot like a man, he was made to 'do time' in prison, like the
ordinary sneak thief that he is."When Brice had concluded, he said
briefly, "The only trouble with your plans, my young friend, is that
about twenty-five men have got to consider them, and have THEIR say
about it.Every man in my gang is a shareholder in these greenbacks, for
I work on the square; and it's for him to say whether he'll give them up
for a reward and the good opinion of the express company.Perhaps," he
went on, with a peculiar smile, "it's just as well that you tried it on
me first!However, I'll sound the boys, and see what comes of it, but
not until you're safe off the premises.""Well, if you come across the d----d thief,
and you recognize him and can get the greenbacks from him, I'll pass
over the game to you."He rose and added, apparently by way of farewell,
"Perhaps it's just as well that I should give you a guide part of the
way to prevent accidents."He went to a door leading to an adjoining
room, and called "Flo!"If he had forgotten her in the excitement of his
interview, he atoned for it by a vivid blush.Her own color was a little
heightened as she slipped into the room, but the two managed to look
demurely at each other, without a word of recognition."This is my niece, Flora," said Snapshot Harry, with a slight wave of
the hand that was by no means uncourtly, "and her company will keep you
from any impertinent questioning as well as if I were with you.Brice, Flo, who came to see me on business, and has quite forgotten
my practical joking."The girl acknowledged Brice's bow with a shyness very different from
her manner of the evening before.Brice felt embarrassed and evidently
showed it, for his host, with a smile, put an end to the constraint
by shaking the young man's hand heartily, bidding him good-by, and
accompanying him to the door."I told you last
night," he said, "that I hoped to meet you the next time with a better
introduction."But you didn't come to see ME," said the girl mischievously."How do you know what my intentions were?"returned the young man
gayly, gazing at the girl's charming face with a serious doubt as to the
singleness of his own intentions."Oh, because I know," she answered, with a toss of her brown head."I
heard what you said to uncle Harry.""Perhaps you saw me, too, when I came," he
said, with a slight touch of bitterness as he thought of his reception.Brice walked on silently; the girl was heartless and
worthy of her education.After a pause she said demurely, "I knew he
wouldn't hurt you--but YOU didn't.That's where you showed your grit in
walking straight on.""And I suppose you were greatly amused," he replied scornfully.The girl lifted her arms a little wearily, as with a half sigh she
readjusted her brown braids under her uncle's gray slouch hat, which she
had caught up as she passed out."Thar ain't much to laugh at here!""But it was mighty funny when you tried to put your hat straight,
and then found thur was that bullet hole right through the brim!And the
way you stared at it--Lordy!"Her musical laugh was infectious, and swept away his outraged dignity.At last she said, gazing at his hat, "It won't do for
you to go back to your folks wearin' that sort o' thing.With a saucy movement she audaciously lifted his hat from his
head, and placed her own upon it."But this is your uncle's hat," he remonstrated."All the same; he spoiled yours," she laughed, adjusting his hat upon
her own head."But I'll keep yours to remember you by.I'll loop it up
by this hole, and it'll look mighty purty.She plucked a
wild rose from a bush by the wayside, and, passing the stalk through the
bullet hole, pinned the brim against the crown by a thorn."There," she
said, putting on the hat again with a little affectation of coquetry,
"how's that?"Brice thought it very picturesque and becoming to the graceful head
and laughing eyes beneath it, and said so.Then, becoming in his turn
audacious, he drew nearer to her side."I suppose you know the forfeit of putting on a gentleman's hat?"Apparently she did, for she suddenly made a warning gesture, and said,
"Not here!It would be a bigger forfeit than you'd keer fo'."Before he
could reply she turned aside as if quite innocently, and passed into
the shade of a fringe of buckeyes."I didn't mean
that," she said; but in the mean time he had kissed the pink tip of her
ear under its brown coils.He was, nevertheless, somewhat discomfited
by her undisturbed manner and serene face."Ye don't seem to mind bein'
shot at," she said, with an odd smile, "but it won't do for you to
kalkilate that EVERYBODY shoots as keerfully as uncle Harry.""I don't understand," he replied, struck by her manner."Ye ain't very complimentary, or you'd allow that other folks might be
wantin' what you took just now, and might consider you was poachin',"
she returned gravely."My best and strongest holt among those men is
that uncle Harry would kill the first one who tried anything like that
on--and they know it.That's how I get all the liberty I want here, and
can come and go alone as I like."Brice's face flushed quickly with genuine shame and remorse."Do forgive
me," he said hurriedly."I didn't think--I'm a brute and a fool!""Uncle Harry allowed you was either drunk or a born idiot when you was
promenadin' into the valley just now," she said, with a smile."I thought you didn't look like a drinkin' man," she answered
audaciously.Brice bit his lip and walked on silently, at which she cast a sidelong
glance under her widely spaced heavy lashes and said demurely, "I
thought last night it was mighty good for you to stand up for your
frien' Yuba Bill, and then, after ye knew who I was, to let the folks
see you kinder cottoned to me too.Not in the style o' that land-grabber
Heckshill, nor that peart newspaper man, neither.Of course I gave them
as good as they sent," she went on, with a little laugh, but Brice could
see that her sensitive lip in profile had the tremulous and resentful
curve of one who was accustomed to slight and annoyance.Was it possible
that this reckless, self-contained girl felt her position keenly?"I am proud to have your good opinion," he said, with a certain respect
mingled with his admiring glance, "even if I have not your uncle's.""Oh, he likes you well enough, or he wouldn't have hearkened to you a
minute," she said quickly."When you opened out about them greenbacks, I
jes' clutched my cheer SO," she illustrated her words with a gesture
of her hands, and her face actually seemed to grow pale at the
recollection,--"and I nigh started up to stop ye; but that idea of Yuba
Bill bein' robbed TWICE I think tickled him awful.But it was lucky none
o' the gang heard ye or suspected anything.I reckon that's why he sent
me with you,--to keep them from doggin' you and askin' questions that
a straight man like you would be sure to answer.But they daren't
come nigh ye as long as I'm with you!"She threw back her head and
rose-crested hat with a mock air of protection that, however, had a
certain real pride in it."I am very glad of that, if it gives me the chance of having your
company alone," returned Brice, smiling, "and very grateful to your
uncle, whatever were his reasons for making you my guide.But you have
already been that to me," and he told her of the footprints."But for
you," he added, with gentle significance, "I should not have been here."She was silent for a moment, and he could only see the back of her head
and its heavy brown coils.After a pause she asked abruptly, "Where's
your handkerchief?"He took it from his pocket; her ingenious uncle's bullet had torn rather
than pierced the cambric."I thought so," she said, gravely examining it, "but I kin mend it as
good as new.I reckon you allow I can't sew," she continued, "but I do
heaps of mendin', as the digger squaw and Chinamen we have here do only
the coarser work.I'll send it back to you, and meanwhiles you keep
mine."She drew a handkerchief from her pocket and handed it to him.To his
great surprise it was a delicate one, beautifully embroidered, and
utterly incongruous to her station.The idea that flashed upon him,
it is to be feared, showed itself momentarily in his hesitation and
embarrassment.Uncle Harry don't touch passengers' fixin's; that ain't his style.Yet in spite of her laugh, he could see the
sensitive pout of her lower lip."I was only thinking," he said hurriedly and sympathetically, "that it
was too fine for me.But I will be proud to keep it as a souvenir of
you.He don't keer what they cost," she went on,
ignoring the compliment."Why, I've got awfully fine gowns up there that
I only wear when I go to Marysville oncet in a while.""Not"--a little defiantly--"that he's
afeard, for they can't prove anything against him; no man kin swear to
him, and thar ain't an officer that keers to go for him.But he's that
shy for ME he don't keer to have me mixed with him.""Sometimes--but I don't keer for that."She cocked her hat a little
audaciously, but Brice noticed that her arms afterwards dropped at her
side with the same weary gesture he had observed before."Whenever I go
into shops it's always 'Yes, miss,' and 'No, miss,' and 'Certainly,
Miss Dimwood.'I reckon they allow that
Snapshot Harry's rifle carries far."Presently she faced him again, for their conversation had been carried
on in profile.There was a critical, searching look in her brown eyes."Here I'm talkin' to you as if you were one"--Mr.Brice was positive
she was going to say "one of the gang," but she hesitated and concluded,
"one of my relations--like cousin Hiram.""I wish you would think of me as being as true a friend," said the young
man earnestly.She did not reply immediately, but seemed to be examining the distance.They were not far from the canyon now, and the river bank.A fringe of
buckeyes hid the base of the mountain, which had begun to tower up above
them to the invisible stage road overhead."I am going to be a real
guide to you now," she said suddenly."When we reach that buckeye corner
and are out of sight, we will turn into it instead of going through the
canyon.You shall go up the mountain to the stage road, from THIS side.""Coming DOWN, but not going up," she returned, with a laugh."I found
it, and no one knows it but myself."He glanced up at the towering cliff; its nearly perpendicular flanks
were seamed with fissures, some clefts deeply set with stunted growths
of thorn and "scrub," but still sheer and forbidding, and then glanced
back at her incredulously."I will show you," she said, answering his
look with a smile of triumph."I haven't tramped over this whole valley
for nothing!They must think
that we've gone through the canyon.""Yes--any one who is watching us," said the girl dryly.A few steps further on brought them to the buckeye thicket, which
extended to the river bank and mouth of the canyon.The girl lingered
for a moment ostentatiously before it, and then, saying "Come," suddenly
turned at right angles into the thicket.Brice followed, and the next
moment they were hidden by its friendly screen from the valley.On the
other side rose the mountain wall, leaving a narrow trail before them.It was composed of the rocky debris and fallen trees of the cliff, from
which buckeyes and larches were now springing.It was uneven, irregular,
and slowly ascending; but the young girl led the way with the free
footstep of a mountaineer, and yet a grace that was akin to delicacy.Nor could he fail to notice that, after the Western girl's fashion, she
was shod more elegantly and lightly than was consistent with the rude
and rustic surroundings.It was the same slim shoe-print which had
guided him that morning.Presently she stopped, and seemed to be gazing
curiously at the cliff side.On a protruding bush at the edge of one of the wooded clefts of the
mountain flank something was hanging, and in the freshening southerly
wind was flapping heavily, like a raven's wing, or as if still saturated
with the last night's rain.said Flo, gazing
intently at the unsightly and incongruous attachment to the shrub, which
had a vague, weird suggestion."It looks like a man's coat," remarked Brice uneasily."Then somebody has come down who won't go up
again!There's a lot of fresh rocks and brush here, too.She was pointing to a spot some yards before them where there had been a
recent precipitation of debris and uprooted shrubs.But mingled with it
lay a mass of rags strangely akin to the tattered remnant that flagged
from the bush a hundred feet above them.The girl suddenly uttered a
sharp feminine cry of mingled horror and disgust,--the first weakness
of sex she had shown,--and, recoiling, grasped Brice's arm.But Brice had already seen that which, while it shocked him, was urging
him forward with an invincible fascination.Gently releasing himself,
and bidding the girl stand back, he moved toward the unsightly heap.Gradually it disclosed a grotesque caricature of a human figure, but so
maimed and doubled up that it seemed a stuffed and fallen scarecrow.As
is common in men stricken suddenly down by accident in the fullness of
life, the clothes asserted themselves before all else with a hideous
ludicrousness, obliterating even the majesty of death in their helpless
yet ironical incongruity.The garments seemed to have never fitted the
wearer, but to have been assumed in ghastly jocularity,--a boot half off
the swollen foot, a ripped waistcoat thrown over the shoulder, were like
the properties of some low comedian.At first the body appeared to be
headless; but as Brice cleared away the debris and lifted it, he saw
with horror that the head was twisted under the shoulder, and swung
helplessly from the dislocated neck.But that horror gave way to a more
intense and thrilling emotion as he saw the face--although strangely
free from laceration or disfigurement, and impurpled and distended into
the simulation of a self-complacent smile--was a face he recognized!It
was the face of the cynical traveler in the coach--the man who he was
now satisfied had robbed it.A strange and selfish resentment took possession of him.Here was the
man through whom he had suffered shame and peril, and who even now
seemed complacently victorious in death.He examined him closely; his
coat and waistcoat had been partly torn away in his fall; his shirt
still clung to him, but through its torn front could be seen a heavy
treasure belt encircling his waist.Forgetting his disgust, Brice tore
away the shirt and unloosed the belt.It was saturated with water like
the rest of the clothing, but its pocket seemed heavy and distended.In
another instant he had opened it, and discovered the envelope containing
the packet of greenbacks, its seal still inviolate and unbroken.The girl was standing a few feet
from him, regarding him curiously."In
trying to escape he must have fallen from the road above.We must go back to your uncle at once," he said
excitedly."No," returned Brice, in equal astonishment, "but you know I agreed with
him that we should work together to recover the money, and I must show
him our good luck.""He told you that if you met the thief and could get the money from him,
you were welcome to it," said the girl gravely, "and you HAVE got it.""But not in the way he meant," returned Brice hurriedly."This man's
death is the result of his attempting to escape from your uncle's guards
along the road; the merit of it belongs to them and your uncle.It would
be cowardly and mean of me to take advantage of it."The girl looked at him with an expression of mingled admiration and
pity."But the guards were placed there before he ever saw you," said
she impatiently."And whatever uncle Harry may want to do, he must do
what the gang says.And with the money once in their possession, or
even in yours, if they knew it, I wouldn't give much for its chances--or
YOURS either--for gettin' out o' this hollow again.""But if THEY are treacherous, that is no reason why I should be so,"
protested Brice stoutly."You've no right to say they were treacherous when they knew nothing of
your plans," said the girl sharply."Your company would have more call
to say YOU were treacherous to it for making a plan without consultin'
them."Brice winced, for he had never thought of that before."You can
offer that reward AFTER you get away from here with the greenbacks.But," she added proudly, with a toss of her head, "go back if you want
to!Tell him where you found it--tell him I did not take
you through the canyon, but was showin' you a new trail I had never
shown to THEM!Tell him that I am a traitor, for I have given them and
him away to you, a stranger, and that you consider yourself the only
straight and honest one about here!""Forgive me," he said hurriedly; "you are
right and I am wrong again.I will first
place these greenbacks in a secure place--and then"--

"Get away first--that's your only holt," she interrupted him quickly,
her eyes still flashing through indignant tears."Come quick, for I must
put you on the trail before they miss me."She darted forward; he followed, but she kept the lead, as much, he
fancied, to evade his observation as to expedite his going.Presently
they stopped before the sloping trunk of a huge pine that had long since
fallen from the height above, but, although splintered where it had
broken ground, had preserved some fifty feet of its straight trunk erect
and leaning like a ladder against the mountain wall."There," she
said, hurriedly pointing to its decaying but still projecting lateral
branches, "you climb it--I have.At the top you'll find it's stuck in a
cleft among the brush.There's a little hollow and an old waterway from
a spring above which makes a trail through the brush.It's as good as
the trail you took from the stage road this mornin', but it's not as
safe comin' down.Keep along it to the spring, and it will land ye jest
the other side of uncle Hiram's cabin.I'll wait here until
ye've reached the cleft.""But you," he said, turning toward her, "how can I ever thank you?"As if anticipating a leave-taking, the girl had already withdrawn
herself a few yards away, and simply made an upward gesture with her
hand.Thus appealed to, Brice could only comply.Perhaps he was a little hurt
at the girl's evident desire to avoid a gentler parting.Securing his
prized envelope within his breast, he began to ascend the tree.Its
inclination, and the aid offered by the broken stumps of branches, made
this comparatively easy, and in a few moments he reached its top,
and stood upon a little ledge in the wall.A swift glance around
him revealed the whole waterway or fissure slanting upward along the
mountain face.Then he turned quickly to look down the dizzy height.At
first he could distinguish nothing but the top of the buckeyes and their
white clustering blossoms.Then something fluttered,--the torn white
handkerchief of his that she had kept.And then he caught a single
glimpse of the flower-plumed hat receding rapidly among the trees, and
Flora Dimwood was gone.III

In twenty-four hours Edward Brice was in San Francisco.But although
successful and the bearer of the treasure, it is doubtful if he
approached this end of his journey with the temerity he had shown on
entering the robbers' valley.A consciousness that the methods he
had employed might excite the ridicule, if not the censure, of his
principals, or that he might have compromised them in his meeting with
Snapshot Harry, considerably modified his youthful exultation.It is
possible that Flora's reproach, which still rankled in his mind, may
have quickened his sensitiveness on that point.However, he had resolved
to tell the whole truth, except his episode with Flora, and to place the
conduct of Snapshot Harry and the Tarboxes in as favorable a light as
possible.But first he had recourse to the manager, a man of shrewd
worldly experience, who had recommended him to his place.When he had
finished and handed him the treasured envelope, the man looked at him
with a critical and yet not unkindly expression."Perhaps it's just as
well, Brice, that you did come to me at first, and did not make your
report to the president and directors.""I suppose," said Brice diffidently, "that they wouldn't have liked my
communicating with the highwayman without their knowledge?""More than that--they wouldn't have believed your story.""Do you think"--

The manager checked him with a laugh.I believe every word
of it, and why?Because you've added nothing to it to make yourself the
regular hero.Why, with your opportunity, and no one able to contradict
you, you might have told me you had a hand-to-hand fight with the
thief, and had to kill him to recover the money, and even brought your
handkerchief and hat back with the bullet holes to prove it."Brice
winked as he thought of the fair possessor of those articles."But as a
story for general circulation, it won't do.Have you told it to any one
else?Brice thought of Flora, but he had resolved not to compromise her, and
he had a consciousness that she would be equally loyal to him.And I suppose you wouldn't mind if it were kept out of the
newspapers?You're not hankering after a reputation as a hero?""Certainly not," said Brice indignantly."Well, then, we'll keep it where it is.I will
hand over the greenbacks to the company, but only as much of your story
as I think they'll stand.Yuba Bill has
already set you up in his report to the company, and the recovery of
this money will put you higher!Only, the PUBLIC need know nothing about
it.""But," asked Brice amazedly, "how can it be prevented?The shippers who
lost the money will have to know that it has been recovered."The company will assume the risk, and repay them just
the same.It's a great deal better to have the reputation for accepting
the responsibility than for the shippers to think that they only get
their money through the accident of its recovery."Besides, it occurred to him
that it kept the secret, and Flora's participation in it, from Snapshot
Harry and the gang."Come," continued the manager, with official curtness.It was not what his impulsive truthful nature
had suggested.It was not what his youthful fancy had imagined.He had
not worked upon the sympathies of the company on behalf of Snapshot
Harry as he believed he would do.His story, far from exciting a chivalrous sentiment, had been pronounced
improbable.Yet he reflected he had so far protected HER, and he
consented with a sigh.Nevertheless, the result ought to have satisfied him.A dazzling check,
inclosed in a letter of thanks from the company the next day, and his
promotion from "the road" to the San Francisco office, would have been
quite enough for any one but Edward Brice.Yet he was grateful, albeit
a little frightened and remorseful over his luck.He could not help
thinking of the kindly tolerance of the highwayman, the miserable death
of the actual thief, which had proved his own salvation, and above all
the generous, high-spirited girl who had aided his escape.While on his
way to San Francisco, and yet in the first glow of his success, he had
written her a few lines from Marysville, inclosed in a letter to Mr.Then a vague
feeling of jealousy took possession of him as he remembered her warning
hint of the attentions to which she was subjected, and he became
singularly appreciative of Snapshot Harry's proficiency as a marksman.Then, cruelest of all, for your impassioned lover is no lover at all
if not cruel in his imaginings, he remembered how she had evaded her
uncle's espionage with HIM; could she not equally with ANOTHER?Perhaps
that was why she had hurried him away,--why she had prevented
his returning to her uncle.Following this came another week of
disappointment and equally miserable cynical philosophy, in which
he persuaded himself he was perfectly satisfied with his material
advancement, that it was the only outcome of his adventure to be
recognized; and he was more miserable than ever.A month had passed, when one morning he received a small package by
post.The address was in a handwriting unknown to him, but opening
the parcel he was surprised to find only a handkerchief neatly folded.Examining it closely, he found it was his own,--the one he had given
her, the rent made by her uncle's bullet so ingeniously and delicately
mended as to almost simulate embroidery.The joy that suddenly filled
him at this proof of her remembrance showed him too plainly how hollow
had been his cynicism and how lasting his hope!Turning over the wrapper
eagerly, he discovered what he had at first thought was some business
card.It was, indeed, printed and not engraved, in some common newspaper
type, and bore the address, "Hiram Tarbox, Land and Timber Agent, 1101
California Street."He again examined the parcel; there was nothing
else,--not a line from HER!But it was a clue at last, and she had not
forgotten him!He seized his hat, and ten minutes later was breasting
the steep sand hill into which California Street in those days plunged,
and again emerged at its crest, with a few struggling houses.But when he reached the summit he could see that the outline of the
street was still plainly marked along the distance by cottages and
new suburban villa-like blocks of houses.1101 was in one of these
blocks, a small tenement enough, but a palace compared to Mr.He impetuously rang the bell, and without waiting to be
announced dashed into the little drawing-room and Mr.Tarbox was arrayed in a suit of clothes as
new, as cheaply decorative, as fresh and, apparently, as damp as his own
drawing room.Did you give her the one I inclosed?burst out Brice, after his first breathless greeting.Tarbox's face here changed so suddenly into his old dejected
doggedness that Brice could have imagined himself back in the Sierran
cabin.The man straightened and bowed himself at Brice's questions, and
then replied with bold, deliberate emphasis:

"Yes, I DID get your letter.I DIDN'T give no letter o' yours to her.And I didn't answer your letter BEFORE, for I didn't propose to answer
it AT ALL.""I didn't give her your letter because I didn't kalkilate to be any
go-between 'twixt you and Snapshot Harry's niece.Sense I read that 'ar paragraph in that paper you gave me, I allowed to
myself that it wasn't the square thing for me to have any more doin's
with him, and I quit it.I jest chucked your letter in the fire.I
didn't answer you because I reckoned I'd no call to correspond with ye,
and when I showed ye that trail over to Harry's camp, it was ended.I've
got a house and business to look arter, and it don't jibe with keepin'
company with 'road agents.'That's what I got outer that paper you gave
me, Mr.Rage and disgust filled Brice at the man's utter selfishness and
shameless desertion of his kindred, none the less powerfully that he
remembered the part he himself had played in concocting the paragraph."Do you mean to say," he demanded passionately, "that for the sake of
that foolish paragraph you gave up your own kindred?That you truckled
to the mean prejudices of your neighbors and kept that poor, defenseless
girl from the only honest roof she could find refuge under?That you
dared to destroy my letter to her, and made her believe I was as selfish
and ungrateful as yourself?"Tarbox still more deliberately, yet with a
certain dignity that Brice had never noticed before, "what's between you
and Flo, and what rights she has fer thinkin' ye 'ez selfish' and 'ez
ongrateful' ez me--ef she does, I dunno!--but when ye talk o' me givin'
up my kindred, and sling such hogwash ez 'ongrateful' and'selfish'
round this yer sittin'-room, mebbe it mout occur to ye that Harry
Dimwood might hev HIS opinion o' what was 'ongrateful' and'selfish' ef
I'd played in between his niece and a young man o' the express company,
his nat'ral enemy.It's one thing to hev helped ye to see her in
her uncle's own camp, but another to help ye by makin' a clandecent
post-offis o' my cabin.Ef, instead o' writin', you'd hev posted
yourself by comin' to me, you mout hev found out that when I broke with
Harry I offered to take Flo with me for good and all--ef he'd keep
away from us.And that's the kind o' 'honest roof' that that thar 'poor
defenseless girl' got under when her crippled mother died three
weeks ago, and left Harry free.It was by 'trucklin'' to them'mean
prejudices,' and readin' that thar 'foolish paragraph,' that I settled
this thing then and thar!"Brice's revulsion of sentiment was so complete, and the gratitude that
beamed in his eyes was so sincere, that Mr.Tarbox hardly needed the
profuse apologies which broke from him.he continued to
stammer, "I have wronged you, wronged HER--everybody.Tarbox, how I have felt over this, how deeply--how passionately"--

"It DOES make a man <DW38> sometimes," said Mr.Tarbox, relaxing into
demure dryness again, "so I reckon you DID!Mebbe she reckoned so, too,
for she asked me to give you the handkercher I sent ye.It looked as if
she'd bin doin' some fancy work on it."It was stolid and
imperturbable.She had evidently kept the secret of what passed in
the hollow to herself.For the first time he looked around the room
curiously."I didn't know you were a land agent before," he said.All that kem out o' that paragraph, Mr.That man
Heckshill, who was so mighty perlite that night, wrote to me afterwards
that he didn't know my name till he'd seed that paragraph, and he wanted
to know ef, ez a 'well-known citizen,' I could recommend him some timber
lands.I recommended him half o' my own quarter section, and he took it.He's puttin' up a mill thar, and that's another reason why we want peace
and quietness up thar.I'm tryin' (betwixt and between us, Mr.Brice) to
get Harry to cl'ar out and sell his rights in the valley and the water
power on the Fork to Heckshill and me.Tarbox with Miss Flora in your cabin while you
attend to business here," said Brice tentatively.The old woman thought it a good chance to come
to 'Frisco and put Flo in one o' them Catholic convent schools--that
asks no questions whar the raw logs come from, and turns 'em out
first-class plank all round.Tarbox
is jest in the next room, and would admire to tell ye all this--and I'll
go in and send her to you."And with a patronizing wave of the hand, Mr.Tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall.Brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment!Flo, separated from her detrimental uncle, and placed in a convent
school!Tarbox, the obscure pioneer, a shrewd speculator emerging into
success, and taking the uncle's place!And all this within that month
which he had wasted with absurd repinings.How feeble seemed his own
adventure and advancement; how even ludicrous his pretensions to any
patronage and superiority.How this common backwoodsman had set him in
his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and
Heckshill!They had taught him a lesson; perhaps even the sending back
of his handkerchief was part of it!His heart grew heavy; he walked to
the window and gazed out with a long sigh.A light laugh, that might have been an echo of the one which had
attracted him that night in Tarbox's cabin, fell upon his ear.He turned
quickly to meet Flora Dimwood's laughing eyes shining upon him as she
stood in the doorway.Many a time during that month he had thought of this meeting--had
imagined what it would be like--what would be his manner towards
her--what would be her greeting, and what they would say.He would be
cold, gentle, formal, gallant, gay, sad, trustful, reproachful, even as
the moods in which he thought of her came to his foolish brain.He would
always begin with respectful seriousness, or a frankness equal to her
own, but never, never again would he offend as he had offended under the
buckeyes!And now, with her pretty face shining upon him, all his plans,
his speeches, his preparations vanished, and left him dumb.Yet he moved
towards her with a brief articulate something on his lips,--something
between a laugh and a sigh,--but that really was a kiss, and--in point
of fact--promptly folded her in his arms.Yet it was certainly direct, and perhaps the best that could be done,
for the young lady did not emerge from it as coolly, as unemotionally,
nor possibly as quickly as she had under the shade of the buckeyes.But
she persuaded him--by still holding his hand--to sit beside her on the
chilly, highly varnished "green rep" sofa, albeit to him it was a bank
in a bower of enchantment.Then she said, with adorable reproachfulness,
"You don't ask what I did with the body."He was young, and unfamiliar with the evasive
expansiveness of the female mind at such supreme moments."The body--oh, yes--certainly.""I buried it myself--it was suthin too awful!--and the gang would have
been sure to have found it, and the empty belt.It was not a time for strictly grammatical negatives, and I am
afraid that the girl's characteristically familiar speech, even when
pathetically corrected here and there by the influence of the convent,
endeared her the more to him.And when she said, "And now, Mr.Edward
Brice, sit over at that end of the sofy and let's talk," they talked.They talked for an hour, more or less continuously, until they were
surprised by a discreet cough and the entrance of Mrs.Then
there was more talk, and the discovery that Mr.Brice was long due at
the office."Ye might drop in, now and then, whenever ye feel like it, and Flo is at
home," suggested Mrs.Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month."And now--ez
everything is settled and in order, Mr.Brice, and ef you should be
wantin' to say anything about it to your bosses at the office, ye may
mention MY name ez Flo Dimwood's second cousin, and say I'm a depositor
in their bank.And," with greater deliberation, "ef anything at any time
should be thrown up at ye for marryin' a niece o' Snapshot Harry's, ye
might mention, keerless like, that Snapshot Harry, under the name o'
Henry J. Dimwood, has held shares in their old bank for years!"A TREASURE OF THE REDWOODS


PART I

Mr.Jack Fleming stopped suddenly before a lifeless and decaying
redwood-tree with an expression of disgust and impatience.It was the
very tree he had passed only an hour before, and he now knew he had been
describing that mysterious and hopeless circle familiar enough to those
lost in the woods.There was no mistaking the tree, with its one broken branch which
depended at an angle like the arm of a semaphore; nor did it relieve
his mind to reflect that his mishap was partly due to his own foolish
abstraction.He was returning to camp from a neighboring mining town,
and while indulging in the usual day-dreams of a youthful prospector,
had deviated from his path in attempting to make a short cut through the
forest.He had lost the sun, his only guide, in the thickly interlaced
boughs above him, which suffused though the long columnar vault only
a vague, melancholy twilight.He had evidently penetrated some unknown
seclusion, absolutely primeval and untrodden.The thick layers of
decaying bark and the desiccated dust of ages deadened his footfall and
invested the gloom with a profound silence.As he stood for a moment or two, irresolute, his ear, by this time
attuned to the stillness, caught the faint but distinct lap and trickle
of water.He was hot and thirsty, and turned instinctively in that
direction.A very few paces brought him to a fallen tree; at the foot of
its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly
but persistently loosened their hold on the soil, and worked their ruin.A pool of cool and clear water, formed by the disruption of the soil,
overflowed, and after a few yards sank again in the sodden floor.As he drank and bathed his head and hands in this sylvan basin, he
noticed the white glitter of a quartz ledge in its depths, and was
considerably surprised and relieved to find, hard by, an actual outcrop
of that rock through the thick carpet of bark and dust.This betokened
that he was near the edge of the forest or some rocky opening.He
fancied that the light grew clearer beyond, and the presence of a few
fronds of ferns confirmed him in the belief that he was approaching a
different belt of vegetation.Presently he saw the vertical beams of the
sun again piercing the opening in the distance.With this prospect of
speedy deliverance from the forest at last secure, he did not hurry
forward, but on the contrary coolly retraced his footsteps to the spring
again.The fact was that the instincts and hopes of the prospector were
strongly dominant in him, and having noticed the quartz ledge and the
contiguous outcrop, he determined to examine them more closely.He
had still time to find his way home, and it might not be so easy to
penetrate the wilderness again.Unfortunately, he had neither pick, pan,
nor shovel with him, but a very cursory displacement of the soil around
the spring and at the outcrop with his hands showed him the usual red
soil and decomposed quartz which constituted an "indication."Yet none
knew better than himself how disappointing and illusive its results
often were, and he regretted that he had not a pan to enable him to test
the soil by washing it at the spring.If there were only a miner's cabin
handy, he could easily borrow what he wanted.It was just the usual
luck,--"the things a man sees when he hasn't his gun with him!"He turned impatiently away again in the direction of the opening.When
he reached it, he found himself on a rocky hillside sloping toward a
small green valley.A light smoke curled above a clump of willows; it
was from the chimney of a low dwelling, but a second glance told him
that it was no miner's cabin.There was a larger clearing around the
house, and some rude attempt at cultivation in a roughly fenced area.Nevertheless, he determined to try his luck in borrowing a pick and pan
there; at the worst he could inquire his way to the main road again.A hurried scramble down the hill brought him to the dwelling,--a
rambling addition of sheds to the usual log cabin.But he was surprised
to find that its exterior, and indeed the palings of the fence around
it, were covered with the stretched and drying skins of animals.The
pelts of bear, panther, wolf, and fox were intermingled with squirrel
and wildcat skins, and the displayed wings of eagle, hawk, and
kingfisher.There was no trail leading to or from the cabin; it seemed
to have been lost in this opening of the encompassing woods and left
alone and solitary.The barking of a couple of tethered hounds at last brought a figure to
the door of the nearest lean-to shed.It seemed to be that of a
young girl, but it was clad in garments so ridiculously large and
disproportionate that it was difficult to tell her precise age.A calico
dress was pinned up at the skirt, and tightly girt at the waist by an
apron--so long that one corner had to be tucked in at the apron
string diagonally, to keep the wearer from treading on it.An enormous
sunbonnet of yellow nankeen completely concealed her head and face, but
allowed two knotted and twisted brown tails of hair to escape under its
frilled cape behind.She was evidently engaged in some culinary work,
and still held a large tin basin or pan she had been cleaning clasped to
her breast.Fleming's eye glanced at it covetously, ignoring the figure behind it."I have lost my way in the woods.Can you tell me in what direction the
main road lies?"She pointed a small red hand apparently in the direction he had come."Straight over thar--across the hill."He had been making a circuit of the forest instead of
going through it--and this open space containing the cabin was on a
remote outskirt!"Jest a spell arter ye rise the hill, ef ye keep 'longside the woods.But it's a right smart chance beyond, ef ye go through it."In the local dialect a "spell" was under
a mile; "a right smart chance" might be three or four miles farther.Luckily the spring and outcrop were near the outskirts; he would pass
near them again on his way.He looked longingly at the pan which she
still held in her hands."Would you mind lending me that pan for a
little while?"Yet her tone was one of childish
curiosity rather than suspicion.Fleming would have liked to avoid the
question and the consequent exposure of his discovery which a direct
answer implied."I want to wash a little dirt," he said bluntly.The girl turned her deep sunbonnet toward him.Somewhere in its depths
he saw the flash of white teeth."Go along with ye--ye're funnin'!""I want to wash out some dirt in that pan--I'm prospecting for gold," he
said; "don't you understand?""Well, yes--a sort of one," he returned, with a laugh."Then ye'd better be scootin' out o' this mighty quick afore dad comes.He don't cotton to miners, and won't have 'em around.That's why he
lives out here.""Well, I don't live out here," responded the young man lightly."I
shouldn't be here if I hadn't lost my way, and in half an hour I'll be
off again.But," he added, as the girl
still hesitated, "I'll leave a deposit for the pan, if you like.""The money that the pan's worth," said Fleming impatiently.The huge sunbonnet stiffly swung around like the wind-sail of a ship
and stared at the horizon.Ye kin git," said the
voice in its depths."Look here," he said desperately, "I only wanted to prove to you that
I'll bring your pan back safe.If you don't like to take
money, I'll leave this ring with you until I come back.He
slipped a small specimen ring, made out of his first gold findings, from
his little finger.The sunbonnet slowly swung around again and stared at the ring.Then the
little red right hand reached forward, took the ring, placed it on the
forefinger of the left hand, with all the other fingers widely extended
for the sunbonnet to view, and all the while the pan was still held
against her side by the other hand.Fleming noticed that the hands,
though tawny and not over clean, were almost childlike in size, and that
the forefinger was much too small for the ring.He tried to fathom the
depths of the sun-bonnet, but it was dented on one side, and he could
discern only a single pale blue eye and a thin black arch of eyebrow."Well," said Fleming, "is it a go?""Of course ye'll be comin' back for it again," said the girl slowly.There was so much of hopeless disappointment at that prospect in her
voice that Fleming laughed outright."I'm afraid I shall, for I value
the ring very much," he said."It's our bread pan," she said.It might have been anything, for it was by no means new; indeed, it was
battered on one side and the bottom seemed to have been broken; but it
would serve, and Fleming was anxious to be off."Thank you," he said
briefly, and turned away.The hound barked again as he passed; he heard
the girl say, "Shut your head, Tige!"and saw her turn back into the
kitchen, still holding the ring before the sunbonnet.When he reached the woods, he attacked the outcrop he had noticed, and
detached with his hands and the aid of a sharp rock enough of the loose
soil to fill the pan.This he took to the spring, and, lowering the
pan in the pool, began to wash out its contents with the centrifugal
movement of the experienced prospector.The saturated red soil
overflowed the brim with that liquid ooze known as "slumgullion," and
turned the crystal pool to the color of blood until the soil was washed
away.Then the smaller stones were carefully removed and examined, and
then another washing of the now nearly empty pan showed the fine black
sand covering the bottom.the clean pan showed only one or two minute glistening yellow
scales, like pinheads, adhering from their specific gravity to the
bottom; gold, indeed, but merely enough to indicate "the color," and
common to ordinary prospecting in his own locality.He tried another panful with the same result.He became aware that the
pan was leaky, and that infinite care alone prevented the bottom from
falling out during the washing.Still it was an experiment, and the
result a failure.Fleming was too old a prospector to take his disappointment seriously.Indeed, it was characteristic of that performance and that period that
failure left neither hopelessness nor loss of faith behind it; the
prospector had simply miscalculated the exact locality, and was equally
as ready to try his luck again.But Fleming thought it high time to
return to his own mining work in camp, and at once set off to return the
pan to its girlish owner and recover his ring.As he approached the cabin again, he heard the sound of singing.It was
evidently the girl's voice, uplifted in what seemed to be a fragment of
some <DW64> camp-meeting hymn:--

     "Dar was a poor man and his name it was Lazarum,
     Lord bress de Lamb--glory hallelugerum!The first two lines had a brisk movement, accented apparently by the
clapping of hands or the beating of a tin pan, but the refrain, "Lord
bress de Lamb," was drawn out in a lugubrious chant of infinite tenuity."The rich man died and he went straight to hellerum.Lord bress de Lamb--glory hallelugerum!Before he could rap the voice rose
again:--

     "When ye see a poo' man be sure to give him crumbsorum,
     Lord bress de Lamb--glory hallelugerum!At the end of this interminable refrain, drawn out in a youthful nasal
contralto, Fleming knocked.The girl instantly appeared, holding the
ring in her fingers."I reckoned it was you," she said, with an affected
briskness, to conceal her evident dislike at parting with the trinket.With the opening of the door
the sunbonnet had fallen back like a buggy top, disclosing for the first
time the head and shoulders of the wearer.She was not a child, but
a smart young woman of seventeen or eighteen, and much of his
embarrassment arose from the consciousness that he had no reason
whatever for having believed her otherwise."I hope I didn't interrupt your singing," he said awkwardly."It was only one o' mammy's camp-meetin' songs," said the girl.he asked, glancing past the girl into the
kitchen."'Tain't mother--she's dead.She's gone to
Jimtown, and taken my duds to get some new ones fitted to me.This accounted for her strange appearance; but Fleming noticed that
the girl's manner had not the slightest consciousness of their
unbecomingness, nor of the charms of face and figure they had marred.said Fleming, laughing; "I'm afraid not.""Dad hez--he's got it pow'ful.""Is that the reason he don't like miners?""'Take not to yourself the mammon of unrighteousness,'" said the girl,
with the confident air of repeating a lesson."That's what the Book
says.""But I read the Bible, too," replied the young man."Dad says, 'The letter killeth'!"Fleming looked at the trophies nailed on the walls with a vague wonder
if this peculiar Scriptural destructiveness had anything to do with his
skill as a marksman."Dad's a mighty hunter afore the Lord.""Trades 'em off for grub and fixin's.But he don't believe in trottin'
round in the mud for gold.""Don't you suppose these animals would have preferred it if he had?The girl stared at him, and then, to his great surprise, laughed instead
of being angry.It was a very fascinating laugh in her imperfectly
nourished pale face, and her little teeth revealed the bluish milky
whiteness of pips of young Indian corn."Wot yer lookin' at?""You," he replied, with equal frankness."It's them duds," she said, looking down at her dress; "I reckon I ain't
got the hang o' 'em."Yet there was not the slightest tone of embarrassment or even coquetry
in her manner, as with both hands she tried to gather in the loose folds
around her waist."Let me help you," he said gravely.She lifted up her arms with childlike simplicity and backed toward him
as he stepped behind her, drew in the folds, and pinned them around what
proved a very small waist indeed.Then he untied the apron, took it
off, folded it in half, and retied its curtailed proportions around the
waist."It does feel a heap easier," she said, with a little shiver of
satisfaction, as she lifted her round cheek, and the tail of her blue
eyes with their brown lashes, over her shoulder.It was a tempting
moment--but Jack felt that the whole race of gold hunters was on trial
just then, and was adamant!Perhaps he was a gentle fellow at heart,
too."I could loop up that dress also, if I had more pins," he remarked
tentatively.In this operation--a kind of festooning--the
girl's petticoat, a piece of common washed-out blue flannel, as pale
as her eyes, but of the commonest material, became visible, but without
fear or reproach to either."There, that looks more tidy," said Jack, critically surveying his work
and a little of the small ankles revealed.The girl also examined it
carefully by its reflection on the surface of the saucepan."Looks a
little like a chiny girl, don't it?"Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Jack would have resented this, thinking she meant a Chinese, until he
saw her pointing to a cheap crockery ornament, representing a Dutch
shepherdess, on the shelf."You beat mammy out o' sight!""It will jest
set her clear crazy when she sees me.""Then you had better say you did it yourself," said Fleming.asked the girl, suddenly opening her eyes on him with relentless
frankness."You said your father didn't like miners, and he mightn't like your
lending your pan to me.""I'm more afraid o' lyin' than o' dad," she said with an elevation of
moral sentiment that was, however, slightly weakened by the addition,
"Mammy'll say anything I'll tell her to say.""Well, good-by," said Fleming, extending his hand."Ye didn't tell me what luck ye had with the pan," she said, delaying
taking his hand."Oh, my usual luck,--nothing," he
returned, with a smile."Ye seem to keer more for gettin' yer old ring back than for any luck,"
she continued."I reckon you ain't much o' a miner.""Ye didn't say wot yer name was, in case dad wants to know.""I don't think he will want to; but it's John Fleming.""You didn't tell me yours," he said, holding the
little red fingers, "in case I wanted to know."It pleased her to consider the rejoinder intensely witty.She showed all
her little teeth, threw away his hand, and said:--

"G' long with ye, Mr.It's Tinka"--

"Tinker?""Yes; short for Katinka,--Katinka Jallinger.""Good-by, Miss Jallinger."Dad's name is Henry Boone Jallinger, of Kentucky, ef ye was
ever askin'."He turned away as she swiftly re-entered the house.As he walked away,
he half expected to hear her voice uplifted again in the camp-meeting
chant, but he was disappointed.When he reached the top of the hill he
turned and looked back at the cabin.She was apparently waiting for this, and waved him an adieu with the
humble pan he had borrowed.It flashed a moment dazzlingly as it caught
the declining sun, and then went out, even obliterating the little
figure behind it.Jack Fleming was indeed "not much of a miner."He and his
partners--both as young, hopeful, and inefficient as himself--had
for three months worked a claim in a mountain mining settlement
which yielded them a certain amount of healthy exercise, good-humored
grumbling, and exalted independence.To dig for three or four hours in
the morning, smoke their pipes under a redwood-tree for an hour at
noon, take up their labors again until sunset, when they "washed up"
and gathered sufficient gold to pay for their daily wants, was, without
their seeking it, or even knowing it, the realization of a charming
socialistic ideal which better men than themselves had only dreamed of.Fleming fell back into this refined barbarism, giving little thought to
his woodland experience, and no revelation of it to his partners.He had
transacted their business at the mining town.His deviations en route
were nothing to them, and small account to himself.The third day after his return he was lying under a redwood when his
partner approached him."You aren't uneasy in your mind about any unpaid bill--say a wash
bill--that you're owing?""There's a big <DW65> woman in camp looking for you; she's got a folded
account paper in her hand."There must be some mistake," suggested Fleming, sitting up."She says not, and she's got your name pat enough!Faulkner" (his other
partner) "headed her straight up the gulch, away from camp, while I came
down to warn you.So if you choose to skedaddle into the brush out there
and lie low until we get her away, we'll fix it!"His partner looked aghast at this temerity, but Fleming, jumping to his
feet, at once set out to meet his mysterious visitor.This was no easy
matter, as the ingenious Faulkner was laboriously leading his charge up
the steep gulch road, with great politeness, but many audible misgivings
as to whether this was not "Jack Fleming's day for going to Jamestown."He was further lightening the journey by cheering accounts of the recent
depredations of bears and panthers in that immediate locality.When
overtaken by Fleming he affected a start of joyful surprise, to conceal
the look of warning which Fleming did not heed,--having no eyes but
for Faulkners companion.She was a very fat <DW64> woman, panting with
exertion and suppressed impatience.Fleming's heart was filled with
compunction.Ye kin pick dis yar insek, dis caterpillier," she said, pointing
to Faulkner, "off my paf.Ye kin tell dis yar chipmunk dat when he comes
to showin' me mule tracks for b'ar tracks, he's barkin' up de wrong
tree!Dat when he tells me dat he sees panfers a-promenadin' round in de
short grass or hidin' behime rocks in de open, he hain't talkin' to no
<DW65> chile, but a growed woman!Ye kin tell him dat Mammy Curtis lived
in de woods afo' he was born, and hez seen more b'ars and mountain lyuns
dan he hez hairs in his mustarches."The word "Mammy" brought a flash of recollection to Fleming."I am very sorry," he began; but to his surprise the <DW64> woman burst
into a good-tempered laugh.S'long's you is Marse Fleming and de man dat took
dat 'ar pan offer Tinka de odder day, I ain't mindin' yo' frens'
bedevilments.I've got somefin fo' you, yar, and a little box," and she
handed him a folded paper.Fleming felt himself reddening, he knew not why, at which Faulkner
discreetly but ostentatiously withdrew, conveying to his other partner
painful conviction that Fleming had borrowed a pan from a traveling
tinker, whose <DW64> wife was even now presenting a bill for the same,
and demanding a settlement.Relieved by his departure, Fleming hurriedly
tore open the folded paper.It was a letter written upon a leaf torn
out of an old account book, whose ruled lines had undoubtedly given
his partners the idea that it was a bill.Fleming hurriedly read the
following, traced with a pencil in a schoolgirl's hand:--


Mr.Dear Sir,--After you went away that day I took that pan you brought back
to mix a batch of bread and biscuits.The next morning at breakfast dad
says: "What's gone o' them thar biscuits--my teeth is just broke with
them--they're so gritty--they're abominable!says he, and
with that he chucks over to me two or three flakes of gold that was in
them.You had better
luck than you was knowing of!Some of the gold you
washed had got slipped into the sides of the pan where it was broke,
and the sticky dough must have brought it out, and I kneaded them up
unbeknowing.Of course I had to tell a wicked lie, but "Be ye all things
to all men," says the Book, and I thought you ought to know your good
luck, and I send mammy with this and the gold in a little box.Of
course, if dad was a hunter of Mammon and not of God's own beasts, he
would have been mighty keen about finding where it came from, but he
allows it was in the water in our near spring.Do you care
for your ring now as much as you did?Yours very respectfully,

KATINKA JALLINGER.Fleming glanced up from the paper, mammy put a small cardboard
box in his hand.For an instant he hesitated to open it, not knowing how
far mammy was intrusted with the secret.To his great relief she said
briskly: "Well, dar!now dat job's done gone and often my han's, I allow
to quit and jest get off dis yer camp afo' ye kin shake a stick.So
don't tell me nuffin I ain't gotter tell when I goes back.""You can tell her I thank her--and--I'll attend to
it," he said vaguely; "that is--I"--

"Hold dar!that's just enuff, honey--no mo'!So long to ye and youse
folks."He watched her striding away toward the main road, and then opened the
box.It contained three flakes of placer or surface gold, weighing in all
about a quarter of an ounce.They could easily have slipped into the
interstices of the broken pan and not have been observed by him.If this
was the result of the washing of a single pan--and he could now easily
imagine that other flakes might have escaped--what--But he stopped,
dazed and bewildered at the bare suggestion.He gazed upon the vanishing
figure of "mammy."Could she--could Katinka--have the least suspicion of
the possibilities of this discovery?Or had Providence put the keeping
of this secret into the hands of those who least understood its
importance?For an instant he thought of running after her with a
word of caution; but on reflection he saw that this might awaken her
suspicion and precipitate a discovery by another.His only safety for the present was silence, until he could repeat his
experiment.How should he get away without his partners' knowledge of his purpose?He was too loyal to them to wish to keep this good fortune to himself,
but he was not yet sure of his good fortune.It might be only a little
"pocket" which he had just emptied; it might be a larger one which
another trial would exhaust.He had put up no "notice;" he might find it already in possession of
Katinka's father, or any chance prospector like himself.In either case
he would be covered with ridicule by his partners and the camp, or more
seriously rebuked for his carelessness and stupidity.he could not
tell them the truth; nor could he lie.He would say he was called away
for a day on private business.Luckily for him, the active imagination of his partners was even now
helping him.The theory of the "tinker" and the "pan" was indignantly
rejected by his other partner.His blushes and embarrassment were
suddenly remembered by Faulkner, and by the time he reached his cabin,
they had settled that the <DW64> woman had brought him a love letter!He
was young and good looking; what was more natural than that he should
have some distant love affair?His embarrassed statement that he must leave early the next morning
on business that he could not at PRESENT disclose was considered amply
confirmatory, and received with maliciously significant acquiescence."Only," said Faulkner, "at YOUR age, sonny,"--he was nine months older
than Fleming,--"I should have gone TO-NIGHT."Surely Providence was
favoring him!He was sorely tempted to go first to
the cabin, but every moment was precious until he had tested the proof
of his good fortune.It was high noon before he reached the fringe of forest.A few paces
farther and he found the spring and outcrop.To avert his partners'
suspicions he had not brought his own implements, but had borrowed a
pan, spade, and pick from a neighbor's claim before setting out.The
spot was apparently in the same condition as when he left it, and with
a beating heart he at once set to work, an easy task with his new
implements.He nervously watched the water overflow the pan of dirt
at its edges until, emptied of earth and gravel, the black sand alone
covered the bottom.A slight premonition of disappointment followed;
a rich indication would have shown itself before this!A few more
workings, and the pan was quite empty except for a few pin-points of
"color," almost exactly the quantity he found before.He washed another
pan with the same result.Another taken from a different level of the
outcrop yielded neither more nor less!There was no mistake: it was
a failure!His discovery had been only a little "pocket," and the few
flakes she had sent him were the first and last of that discovery.He sat down with a sense of relief; he could face his partners again
without disloyalty; he could see that pretty little figure once more
without the compunction of having incurred her father's prejudices by
locating a permanent claim so near his cabin.In fact, he could carry
out his partners' fancy to the letter!He quickly heaped his implements together and turned to leave the wood;
but he was confronted by a figure that at first he scarcely recognized.the young girl of the cabin, who had sent him the
gold.She was dressed differently--perhaps in her ordinary every-day
garments--a bright sprigged muslin, a chip hat with blue ribbons set
upon a coil of luxurious brown hair.But what struck him most was that
the girlish and diminutive character of the figure had vanished with
her ill-fitting clothes; the girl that stood before him was of ordinary
height, and of a prettiness and grace of figure that he felt would
have attracted anywhere.Fleming felt himself suddenly embarrassed,--a
feeling that was not lessened when he noticed that her pretty lip was
compressed and her eyebrows a little straightened as she gazed at him."Ye made a bee line for the woods, I see," she said coldly."I allowed
ye might have been droppin' in to our house first.""So I should," said Fleming quickly, "but I thought I ought to first
make sure of the information you took the trouble to send me."He
hesitated to speak of the ill luck he had just experienced; he could
laugh at it himself--but would she?"Yes, but I'm afraid it hasn't the magic
of yours.I believe you bewitched your old
pan."Her face flushed a little and brightened, and her lip relaxed with a
smile.Ye don't mean to say ye had no luck to-day?""Ye see, I said all 'long ye weren't much o' a miner.Ef ye had as much as a grain o' mustard seed,
ye'd remove mountains; it's in the Book.""Yes, and this mountain is on the bedrock, and my faith is not strong
enough," he said laughingly."And then, that would be having faith in
Mammon, and you don't want me to have THAT.""I jest reckon ye don't care a picayune
whether ye strike anything or not," she said half admiringly."To please you I'll try again, if you'll look on.Perhaps you'll bring
me luck as you did before.I will fill it and
you shall wash it out.She stiffened a little at this, and then said pertly, "Wot's that?"She smiled again, this time with a new color in her pale face."Maybe I
am," she said, with sudden gravity.He quickly filled the pan again with soil, brought it to the spring,
and first washed out the greater bulk of loose soil."Now come here and
kneel down beside me," he said, "and take the pan and do as I show you."Suddenly she lifted her little hand with a
gesture of warning."Wait a minit--jest a minit--till the water runs
clear again."The pool had become slightly discolored from the first washing."That makes no difference," he said quickly.She laid her brown hand upon his arm; a pleasant
warmth seemed to follow her touch.Then she said joyously, "Look down
there."The pool had settled, resumed its
mirror-like calm, and reflected distinctly, not only their two bending
faces, but their two figures kneeling side by side.Two tall redwoods
rose on either side of them, like the columns before an altar.The drone of a bumble-bee near by seemed
to make the silence swim drowsily in their ears; far off they heard the
faint beat of a woodpecker.The suggestion of their kneeling figures in
this magic mirror was vague, unreasoning, yet for the moment none the
less irresistible.His arm instinctively crept around her little waist
as he whispered,--he scarce knew what he said,--"Perhaps here is the
treasure I am seeking."The girl laughed, released herself, and sprang up; the pan sank
ingloriously to the bottom of the pool, where Fleming had to grope for
it, assisted by Tinka, who rolled up her sleeve to her elbow.For a
minute or two they washed gravely, but with no better success than
attended his own individual efforts.The result in the bottom of the pan
was the same."You see," he said gayly, "the Mammon of unrighteousness is not for
me--at least, so near your father's tabernacle.""That makes no difference now," said the girl quickly, "for dad is goin'
to move, anyway, farther up the mountains.He says it's gettin' too
crowded for him here--when the last settler took up a section three
miles off.""Well, I'll
try my hand here a little longer.I'll put up a notice of claim; I don't
suppose your father would object."I reckon ye might do it ef ye wanted--ef ye was THAT keen on gettin'
gold!"There was something in the girl's tone
which this budding lover resented."Oh, well," he said, "I see that it might make unpleasantness with your
father.I only thought," he went on, with tenderer tentativeness, "that
it would be pleasant to work here near you.""Ye'd be only wastin' yer time," she said darkly."Perhaps you're right," he answered sadly and a
little bitterly, "and I'll go at once."He walked to the spring, and gathered up his tools."Thank you again for
your kindness, and good-by."He held out his hand, which she took passively, and he moved away.But he had not gone far before she called him.He turned to find her
still standing where he had left her, her little hands clinched at her
side, and her widely opened eyes staring at him.Suddenly she ran
at him, and, catching the lapels of his coat in both hands, held him
rigidly fast.ye sha'n't go--ye mustn't go!"I've told lies to dad--to mammy--to
YOU!I've borne false witness--I'm worse than Sapphira--I've acted a
big lie.Fleming, I've made you come back here for nothing!Ye didn't find no gold the other day.I--I--SALTED THAT PAN!""Yes,'salted it,'" she faltered; "that's what dad says they call
it--what those wicked sons of Mammon do to their claims to sell them.I--put gold in the pan myself; it wasn't there before."Then suddenly the fountains in the deep of her blue eyes
were broken up; she burst into a sob, and buried her head in her hands,
and her hands on his shoulder."Because--because"--she sobbed against
him--"I WANTED YOU to come back!"He kissed her lovingly, forgivingly,
gratefully, tearfully, smilingly--and paused; then he kissed her
sympathetically, understandingly, apologetically, explanatorily, in lieu
of other conversation.Then, becoming coherent, he asked,--

"But WHERE did you get the gold?""Oh," she said between fitful and despairing sobs, "somewhere!--I don't
know--out of the old Run--long ago--when I was little!I didn't never
dare say anything to dad--he'd have been crazy mad at his own daughter
diggin'--and I never cared nor thought a single bit about it until I saw
you."Suddenly she threw back her head; her chip hat fell back from her
face, rosy with a dawning inspiration!"Oh, say, Jack!--you don't
think that--after all this time--there might"--She did not finish the
sentence, but, grasping his hand, cried, "Come!"She caught up the pan, he seized the shovel and pick, and they raced
like boy and girl down the hill.When within a few hundred feet of the
house she turned at right angles into the clearing, and saying, "Don't
be skeered; dad's away," ran boldly on, still holding his hand, along
the little valley.At its farther extremity they came to the "Run," a
half-dried watercourse whose rocky sides were marked by the erosion of
winter torrents.It was apparently as wild and secluded as the forest
spring."Nobody ever came here," said the girl hurriedly, "after dad
sunk the well at the house."One or two pools still remained in the Run from the last season's flow,
water enough to wash out several pans of dirt.Selecting a spot where the white quartz was visible, Fleming attacked
the bank with the pick.After one or two blows it began to yield and
crumble away at his feet.He washed out a panful perfunctorily, more
intent on the girl than his work; she, eager, alert, and breathless,
had changed places with him, and become the anxious prospector!He threw away the pan with a laugh, to take her
little hand!He attacked the bank once more with such energy that a great part of
it caved and fell, filling the pan and even burying the shovel in the
debris.He unearthed the latter while Tinka was struggling to get out
the pan."The mean thing is stuck and won't move," she said pettishly."I think
it's broken now, too, just like ours."Fleming came laughingly forward, and, putting one arm around the girl's
waist, attempted to assist her with the other.The pan was immovable,
and, indeed, seemed to be broken and bent.Suddenly he uttered an
exclamation and began hurriedly to brush away the dirt and throw the
soil out of the pan.In another moment he had revealed a fragment of decomposed quartz, like
discolored honeycombed cheese, half filling the pan.But on its side,
where the pick had struck it glancingly, there was a yellow streak
like a ray of sunshine!And as he strove to lift it he felt in that
unmistakable omnipotency of weight that it was seamed and celled with
gold.Fleming's engagement, two weeks later, to the daughter
of the recluse religious hunter who had made a big strike at Lone Run,
excited some skeptical discussion, even among the honest congratulations
of his partners."That's a mighty queer story how Jack got that girl sweet on him just by
borrowin' a prospectin' pan of her," said Faulkner, between the whiffs
of his pipe under the trees."You and me might have borrowed a hundred
prospectin' pans and never got even a drink thrown in.Then to think
of that old preachin' <DW53>-hunter hevin' to give in and pass his strike
over to his daughter's feller, jest because he had scruples about gold
diggin' himself.He'd hev booted you and me outer his ranch first.""Lord, ye ain't takin' no stock in that hogwash," responded the other.John went back to the garden."Why, everybody knows old man Jallinger pretended to be sick o' miners
and minin' camps, and couldn't bear to hev 'em near him, only jest
because he himself was all the while secretly prospectin' the whole lode
and didn't want no interlopers.It was only when Fleming nippled in by
gettin' hold o' the girl that Jallinger knew the secret was out, and
that's the way he bought him off.Why, Jack wasn't no miner--never
was--ye could see that.The only treasure he
found in the woods was Tinka Jallinger!"A BELLE OF CANADA CITY


Cissy was tying her hat under her round chin before a small glass at
her window.The window gave upon a background of serrated mountain and
olive-shadowed canyon, with a faint additional outline of a higher snow
level--the only dreamy suggestion of the whole landscape.The foreground
was a glaringly fresh and unpicturesque mining town, whose irregular
attempts at regularity were set forth with all the cruel, uncompromising
clearness of the Californian atmosphere.There was the straight Main
Street with its new brick block of "stores," ending abruptly against a
tangled bluff; there was the ruthless clearing in the sedate pines where
the hideous spire of the new church imitated the soaring of the solemn
shafts it had displaced with almost irreligious mockery.Yet this
foreground was Cissy's world--her life, her sole girlish experience.She
did not, however, bother her pretty head with the view just then, but
moved her cheek up and down before the glass, the better to examine
by the merciless glare of the sunlight a few freckles that starred the
hollows of her temples.Like others of her sex, she was a poor critic
of what was her real beauty, and quarreled with that peculiar texture of
her healthy skin which made her face as eloquent in her sun-kissed cheek
as in her bright eyes and expression.Nevertheless, she was somewhat
consoled by the ravishing effect of the bowknot she had just tied, and
turned away not wholly dissatisfied.Indeed, as the acknowledged belle
of Canada City and the daughter of its principal banker, small wonder
that a certain frank vanity and childlike imperiousness were among her
faults--and her attractions.She bounded down the stairs and into the front parlor, for their house
possessed the unheard-of luxury of a double drawing-room, albeit the
second apartment contained a desk, and was occasionally used by Cissy's
father in private business interviews with anxious seekers of "advances"
who shunned the publicity of the bank.Here she instantly flew into the
arms of her bosom friend, Miss Piney Tibbs, a girl only a shade or two
less pretty than herself, who, always more or less ill at ease in these
splendors, was awaiting her impatiently.For Miss Tibbs was merely the
daughter of the hotel-keeper; and although Tibbs was a Southerner, and
had owned "his own <DW65>s" in the States, she was of inferior position
and a protegee of Cissy's."Thank goodness you've come," exclaimed Miss Tibbs, "for I've bin
sittin' here till I nigh took root.responded Cissy, as a relevant reply.The "it" referred to Cissy's new hat, and to the young girl the
coherence was perfectly plain.Miss Tibbs looked at "it" severely.It
would not do for a protegee to be too complaisant.Came from the best milliner in San Francisco.""Of course," said Piney, with half assumed envy."When your popper runs
the bank and just wallows in gold!""Never mind, dear," replied Cissy cheerfully."So'll YOUR popper some
day.I'm goin' to get mine to let YOUR popper into something--Ditch
stocks and such.Popper'll do anything for me," she
added a little loftily.Loyal as Piney was to her friend, she was by no means convinced of
this.She knew the difference between the two men, and had a vivid
recollection of hearing her own father express his opinion of Cissy's
respected parent as a "Gold Shark" and "Quartz Miner Crusher."It did
not, however, affect her friendship for Cissy.She only said, "Let's
come!"caught Cissy around the waist, pranced with her out into the
veranda, and gasped, out of breath, "Where are we goin' first?""Down Main Street," said Cissy promptly."And let's stop at Markham's store.They've got some new things in from
Sacramento," added Piney."Country styles," returned Cissy, with a supercilious air.Besides,
Markham's head clerk is gettin' too presumptuous.He asked
me, while I was buyin' something, if I enjoyed the dance last Monday!""But you danced with him," said the simple Piney, in astonishment."But not in his store among his customers," said Cissy sapiently.we're going down Main Street past Secamps'.Those Secamp girls are
sure to be at their windows, looking out.This hat will just turn 'em
green--greener than ever.""You're just horrid, Ciss!""And then," continued Cissy, "we'll just sail down past the new block to
the parson's and make a call.""Oh, I see," said Piney archly."It'll be just about the time when the
new engineer of the mill works has a clean shirt on, and is smoking his
cigyar before the office.""Much anybody cares whether he's
there or not!I haven't forgotten how he showed us over the mill the
other day in a pair of overalls, just like a workman.""But they say he's awfully smart and well educated, and needn't work,
and I'm sure it's very nice of him to dress just like the other men when
he's with 'em," urged Piney.That was just to show that he didn't care what we thought of him,
he's that conceited!And it wasn't respectful, considering one of the
directors was there, all dressed up.You can see it in
his eye, looking you over without blinking and then turning away as if
he'd got enough of you.The engineer had seemed to her to be a singularly
attractive young man, yet she was equally impressed with Cissy's
superior condition, which could find flaws in such perfection.Following
her friend down the steps of the veranda, they passed into the staring
graveled walk of the new garden, only recently recovered from the wild
wood, its accurate diamond and heart shaped beds of vivid green set
in white quartz borders giving it the appearance of elaborately iced
confectionery.A few steps further brought them to the road and the
wooden "sidewalk" to Main Street, which carried civic improvements
to the hillside, and Mr.Turning down this
thoroughfare, they stopped laughing, and otherwise assumed a conscious
half artificial air; for it was the hour when Canada City lounged
listlessly before its shops, its saloons, its offices and mills, or even
held lazy meetings in the dust of the roadway, and the passage down the
principal street of its two prettiest girls was an event to be viewed as
if it were a civic procession.Hats flew off as they passed; place was
freely given; impeding barrels and sacks were removed from the wooden
pavement, and preoccupied indwellers hastily summoned to the front door
to do homage to Cissy Trixit and Piney as they went by.Not but that
Canada City, in the fierce and unregenerate days of its youth, had
seen fairer and higher <DW52> faces, more gayly bedizened, on its
thoroughfares, but never anything so fresh and innocent.Men stood
there all unconsciously, reverencing their absent mothers, sisters, and
daughters, in their spontaneous homage to the pair, and seemed to feel
the wholesome breath of their Eastern homes wafted from the freshly
ironed skirts of these foolish virgins as they rustled by.I am afraid
that neither Cissy nor Piney appreciated this feeling; few women did at
that time; indeed, these young ladies assumed a slight air of hauteur."Really, they do stare so," said Cissy, with eyes dilating with
pleasurable emotion; "we'll have to take the back street next time!"Piney, proud in the glory reflected from Cissy, and in her own,
answered, "We will--sure!"There was only one interruption to this triumphal progress, and that was
so slight as to be noticed by only one of the two girls.As they passed
the new works at the mill, the new engineer, as Piney had foreseen, was
leaning against the doorpost, smoking a pipe.He took his hat from his
head and his pipe from his month as they approached, and greeted them
with an easy "Good-afternoon," yet with a glance that was quietly
observant and tolerantly critical.said Cissy, when they had passed, "didn't I tell you?Did you
ever see such conceit in your born days?I hope you did not look at
him."Piney, conscious of having done so, and of having blushed under his
scrutiny, nevertheless stoutly asserted that she had merely looked at
him "to see who it was."But Cissy was placated by passing the Secamps'
cottage, from whose window the three strapping daughters of John
Secamp, lately an emigrant from Missouri, were, as Cissy had surmised,
lightening the household duties by gazing at the--to them--unwonted
wonders of the street.Whether their complexions, still bearing traces
of the alkali dust and inefficient nourishment of the plains, took a
more yellow tone from the spectacle of Cissy's hat, I cannot say.Cissy
thought they did; perhaps Piney was nearer the truth when she suggested
that they were only "looking" to enable them to make a home-made copy of
the hat next week.Their progress forward and through the outskirts of the town was of
the same triumphal character.Teamsters withheld their oaths and their
uplifted whips as the two girls passed by; weary miners, toiling in
ditches, looked up with a pleasure that was half reminiscent of their
past; younger skylarkers stopped in their horse-play with half smiling,
half apologetic faces; more ambitious riders on the highway urged their
horses to greater speed under the girls' inspiring eyes, and "Vaquero
Billy," charging them, full tilt, brought up his mustang on its haunches
and rigid forelegs, with a sweeping bow of his sombrero, within a foot
of their artfully simulated terror!In this way they at last reached the
clearing in the forest, the church with its ostentatious spire, and the
Reverend Mr.Windibrook's dwelling, otherwise humorously known as "The
Pastorage," where Cissy intended to call.Windibrook had been selected by his ecclesiastical
superiors to minister to the spiritual wants of Canada City as being
what was called a "hearty" man.Certainly, if considerable lung
capacity, absence of reserve, and power of handshaking and back slapping
were necessary to the redemption of Canada City, Mr.Windibrook's
ministration would have been successful.But, singularly enough, the
rude miner was apt to resent this familiarity, and it is recorded that
Isaac Wood, otherwise known as "Grizzly Woods," once responded to a
cheerful back slap from the reverend gentleman by an ostentatiously
friendly hug which nearly dislocated the parson's ribs.Windibrook was more popular on account of his admiring enthusiasm of the
prosperous money-getting members of his flock and a singular sympathy
with their methods, and Mr.Trixit's daring speculations were an
especially delightful theme to him."Ah, Miss Trixit," he said, as Cissy entered the little parlor, "and how
is your dear father?Still startling the money market with his fearless
speculations?This, brother Jones," turning to a visitor, "is the
daughter of our Napoleon of finance, Montagu Trixit.Only last week,
in that deal in 'the Comstock,' he cleared fifty thousand dollars!Yes,
sir," repeating it with unction, "fifty--thousand--dollars!--in about
two hours, and with a single stroke of the pen!I believe I am
not overstating, Miss Trixit?"he added, appealing to Cissy with
a portentous politeness that was as badly fitting as his previous
"heartiness.""I don't know," she said simply.She knew nothing of her father's business, except
the vague reputation of his success.Her modesty, however, produced a singular hilarity in Mr.Windibrook,
and a playful push.Yes, sir,"--to the
visitor,--"I have reason to remember it.I used, sir, the freedom of an old friend.'Trixit,' I said, clapping
my hand on his shoulder, 'the Lord has been good to you.'What do you reckon those
congratulations are worth?'"Many a man, sir, who didn't know his style, would have been staggered.'A new organ,' I
said, 'and as good a one as Sacramento can turn out.'"He took up a piece of paper, scrawled a few lines on it to his cashier,
and said, 'Will that do?'"Windibrook's voice sank to a thrilling
whisper."It was an order for one thousand dollars!THAT is
the father of this young lady.""Ye had better luck than Bishop Briggs had with old Johnson, the
Excelsior Bank president," said the visitor, encouraged by Windibrook's
"heartiness" into a humorous retrospect."Briggs goes to him for a
subscription for a new fence round the buryin'-ground--the old one
havin' rotted away.'Ye don't want no fence,' sez Johnson, short like.'No fence round a buryin'-ground?'Them as is
IN the buryin'-ground can't get OUT, and them as ISN'T don't want to
get IN, nohow!So you kin just travel--I ain't givin' money away on
uselessnesses!'A chill silence followed, which checked even Piney's giggle.Windibrook evidently had no "heartiness" for non-subscribing
humor."There are those who can jest with sacred subjects," he said
ponderously, "but I have always found Mr.Trixit, though blunt,
eminently practical.Your father is still away," he added, shifting the
conversation to Cissy, "hovering wherever he can extract the honey to
store up for the provision of age."He's still away," said Cissy, feeling herself on safe ground, though
she was not aware of her father's entomological habits."In San
Francisco, I think."Windibrook's "heartiness" and console
herself with Mrs.Windibrook's constitutional depression, which was
partly the result of nervous dyspepsia and her husband's boisterous
cordiality."I suppose, dear, you are dreadfully anxious about your
father when he is away from home?"she said to Cissy, with a sympathetic
sigh.Cissy, conscious of never having felt a moment's anxiety, and accustomed
to his absences, replied naively, "Why?"Windibrook, "on account of his great business
responsibilities, you know; so much depends upon him."Again Cissy did not comprehend; she could not understand why this
masterful man, her father, who was equal to her own and, it seemed,
everybody's needs, had any responsibility, or was not as infallible
and constant as the sunshine or the air she breathed.Without being his
confidante, or even his associate, she had since her mother's death no
other experience; youthfully alive to the importance of their wealth, it
seemed to her, however, only a natural result of being HIS daughter.She
smiled vaguely and a little impatiently.They might have talked to
her about HERSELF; it was a little tiresome to always have to answer
questions about her "popper."Nevertheless, she availed herself of
Mrs.Windibrook's invitation to go into the garden and see the new
summerhouse that had been put up among the pines, and gradually diverted
her hostess's conversation into gossip of the town.If it was somewhat
lugubrious and hesitating, it was, however, a relief to Cissy, and
bearing chiefly upon the vicissitudes of others, gave her the comforting
glow of comparison.Touching the complexion of the Secamp girls, Mrs.Windibrook attributed
it to their great privations in the alkali desert.Windibrook, "when their father was ill with fever and ague, they
drove the cattle twenty miles to water through that dreadful poisonous
dust, and when they got there their lips were cracked and bleeding and
their eyelids like burning knives, and Mamie Secamp's hair, which used
to be a beautiful brown like your own, my dear, was bleached into a
rusty yellow.""And they WILL wear colors that don't suit them," said Cissy
impatiently.Windibrook ambiguously; "I suppose they
will have their reward."Nor was the young engineer discussed in a lighter vein."It pains me
dreadfully to see that young man working with the common laborers and
giving himself no rest, just because he says he wants to know exactly
'how the thing is done' and why the old works failed," she remarked
sadly.Windibrook knew he was the son of Judge Masterton and
had rich relations, he wished, of course, to be civil, but somehow young
Masterton and he didn't 'hit off.'Windibrook was told that
he had declared that the prosperity of Canada City was only a mushroom
growth, and it seems too shocking to repeat, dear, but they say he said
that the new church--OUR church--was simply using the Almighty as a big
bluff to the other towns.Windibrook couldn't see him
after that.Why, he even said your father ought to send you to school
somewhere, and not let you grow up in this half civilized place."Strangely enough, Cissy did not hail this corroboration of her dislike
to young Masterton with the liveliness one might have expected.Perhaps
it was because Piney Tibbs was no longer present, having left Cissy at
the parsonage and returned home.Still she enjoyed her visit after a
fashion, romped with the younger Windibrooks and climbed a tree in
the security of her sylvan seclusion and the promptings of her still
healthy, girlish blood, and only came back to cake and tea and her
new hat, which she had prudently hung up in the summer-house, as the
afternoon was waning.When they returned to the house, they found that
Mr.Windibrook had gone out with his visitor, and Cissy was spared the
advertisement of a boisterous escort home, which he generally insisted
upon.She gayly took leave of the infant Windibrook and his mother,
sallied out into the empty road, and once more became conscious of her
new hat.The shadows were already lengthening, and a cool breeze stirred the deep
aisles of the pines on either side of the highway.One or two
people passed her hurriedly, talking and gesticulating, evidently so
preoccupied that they did not notice her.Again, a rapid horseman rode
by without glancing round, overtook the pedestrians, exchanged a few
hurried words with them, and then spurred swiftly away as one of them
shouted after him, "There's another dispatch confirming it."A group
of men talking by the roadside failed to look up as she passed.Cissy
pouted slightly at this want of taste, which made some late election
news or the report of a horse race more enthralling than her new hat and
its owner.Even the toilers in the ditches had left their work, and were
congregated around a man who was reading aloud from a widely margined
"extra" of the "Canada City Press."It seemed provoking, as she knew
her cheeks were glowing from her romp, and was conscious that she was
looking her best.However, the Secamps' cottage was just before her, and
the girls were sure to be on the lookout!She shook out her skirts and
straightened her pretty little figure as she approached the house.But
to her surprise, her coming had evidently been anticipated by them,
and they were actually--and unexpectedly--awaiting her behind the low
whitewashed garden palings!As she neared them they burst into a
shrill, discordant laugh, so full of irony, gratified malice, and mean
exaltation that Cissy was for a moment startled.But only for a moment;
she had her father's reckless audacity, and bore them down with a
display of such pink cheeks and flashing eyes that their laughter was
checked, and they remained open-mouthed as she swept by them.Perhaps this incident prevented her from noticing another but more
passive one.A group of men standing before the new mill--the same
men who had so solicitously challenged her attention with their bows a
couple of hours ago--turned as she approached and suddenly dispersed.It
was not until this was repeated by another group that its oddity forced
itself upon her still angry consciousness.Then the street seemed to
be full of those excited preoccupied groups who melted away as she
advanced.Only one man met her curious eyes,--the engineer,--yet she
missed the usual critical smile with which he was wont to greet her,
and he gave her a bow of such profound respect and gravity that for the
first time she felt really uneasy.She was eager to cross the street on the next block where
there were large plate-glass windows which she and Piney--if Piney were
only with her now!--had often used as mirrors.But there was a great crowd on the next block, congregated around the
bank,--her father's bank!A vague terror, she knew not what, now began
to creep over her.She would have turned into a side street, but mingled
with her fear was a resolution not to show it,--not to even THINK of
it,--to combat it as she had combated the horrid laugh of the Secamp
girls, and she kept her way with a beating heart but erect head, without
looking across the street.There was another crowd before the newspaper office--also on the other
side--and a bulletin board, but she would not try to read it.Only one
idea was in her mind,--to reach home before any one should speak to her;
for the last intelligible sound that had reached her was the laugh of
the Secamp girls, and this was still ringing in her ears, seeming to
voice the hidden strangeness of all she saw, and stirring her, as that
had, with childish indignation.She kept on with unmoved face, however,
and at last turned into the planked side-terrace,--a part of her
father's munificence,--and reached the symmetrical garden-beds and
graveled walk.She ran up the steps of the veranda and entered the
drawing-room through the open French window.Glancing around the
familiar room, at her father's closed desk, at the open piano with the
piece of music she had been practicing that morning, the whole walk
seemed only a foolish dream that had frightened her.She was Cissy
Trixit, the daughter of the richest man in the town!This was her
father's house, the wonder of Canada City!A ring at the front doorbell startled her; without waiting for the
servant to answer it, she stepped out on the veranda, and saw a boy whom
she recognized as a waiter at the hotel kept by Piney's father.He
was holding a note in his hand, and staring intently at the house and
garden.Seeing Cissy, he transferred his stare to her.Snatching the
note from him, she tore it open, and read in Piney's well-known scrawl,
"Dad won't let me come to you now, dear, but I'll try to slip out late
to-night."She had said nothing about
coming NOW--and why should her father prevent her?Cissy crushed the
note between her fingers, and faced the boy."What are you staring at--idiot?"The boy grinned hysterically, a little frightened at Cissy's
straightened brows and snapping eyes.The boy ran off, and Cissy returned to the drawing-room.Then it
occurred to her that the servant had not answered the bell.She called down the basement
staircase, and heard only the echo of her voice in the depths.Were they ALL out,--Susan, Norah, the cook, the Chinaman,
and the gardener?She ran down into the kitchen; the back door was open,
the fires were burning, dishes were upon the table, but the kitchen was
empty.Upon the floor lay a damp copy of the "extra.""Montagu Trixit Absconded!"She threw the paper through the open door as she would have hurled back
the accusation from living lips.Then, in a revulsion of feeling lest
any one should find her there, she ran upstairs and locked herself in
her own room.All!--from the laugh of the Secamp girls
to the turning away of the townspeople as she went by.Her father was a
thief who had stolen money from the bank and run away leaving her alone
to bear it!It was all a lie--a wicked, jealous lie!A foolish lie,
for how could he steal money from HIS OWN bank?Cissy knew very little
of her father--perhaps that was why she believed in him; she knew still
less of business, but she knew that HE did.She had often heard them
say it--perhaps the very ones who now called him names.who had made
Canada City what it was!HE, who, Windibrook said, only to-day, had,
like Moses, touched the rocks of the Canada with his magic wand of
Finance, and streams of public credit and prosperity had gushed from
it!She would shut herself up here,
dismiss all the servants but the Chinaman, and wait until her father
returned.There was a knock, and the entreating voice of Norah, the cook, outside
the door.Cissy unlocked it and flung it open indignantly.It's yourself, miss--and I never knew ye kem back till I met that
gossoon of a hotel waiter in the street," said the panting servant."Sure it was only an hour ago while I was at me woorrck in the kitchen,
and Jim rushes in and sez: 'For the love of God, if iver ye want to see
a blessed cint of the money ye put in the masther's bank, off wid ye now
and draw it out--for there's a run on the bank!'""It was an infamous lie," said Cissy fiercely."Sure, miss, how was oi to know?And if the masther HAS gone away, it's
ownly takin' me money from the other divils down there that's drawin' it
out and dividin' it betwixt and between them."Cissy had a very vague idea of what a "run on the bank" meant, but
Norah's logic seemed to satisfy her feminine reason.Windibrook is in the parlor, miss, and a jintleman on the veranda,"
continued Norah, encouraged."I'll come down," she said briefly.Windibrook was waiting beside the piano, with his soft hat in one
hand and a large white handkerchief in the other.He had confidently
expected to find Cissy in tears, and was ready with boisterous
condolement, but was a little taken aback as the young girl entered
with a pale face, straightened brows, and eyes that shone with audacious
rebellion.However, it was too late to change his attitude."Ah, my
young friend," he said a little awkwardly, "we must not give way to our
emotions, but try to recognize in our trials the benefits of a great
lesson.But," he added hurriedly, seeing her stand still silent but
erect before him, "I see that you do!"He paused, coughed slightly, cast
a glance at the veranda,--where Cissy now for the first time observed
a man standing in an obviously assumed attitude of negligent
abstraction,--moved towards the back room, and in a lower voice said, "A
word with you in private."Windibrook, with a sickly smile, "you are questioned
regarding your father's affairs, you may remember his peculiar and
utterly unsolicited gift of a certain sum towards a new organ, to which
I alluded to-day.You can say that he always expressed great liberality
towards the church, and it was no surprise to you."Cissy only stared at him with dangerous eyes.Windibrook," continued the reverend gentleman in his highest,
heartiest voice, albeit a little hurried, "wished me to say to you that
until you heard from--your friends--she wanted you to come and stay with
her.Cissy, with her bright eyes fixed upon her visitor, said, "I shall stay
here."Windibrook impatiently, "you cannot.That man you see on
the veranda is the sheriff's officer.The house and all that it contains
are in the hands of the law."Cissy's face whitened in proportion as her eyes grew darker, but she
said stoutly, "I shall stay here till my popper tells me to go.""Till your popper tells you to go!"Windibrook harshly,
dropping his heartiness and his handkerchief in a burst of unguarded
temper."Your papa is a thief escaping from justice, you foolish girl;
a disgraced felon, who dare not show his face again in Canada City; and
you are lucky, yes!lucky, miss, if you do not share his disgrace!""And you're a wicked, wicked liar!"said Cissy, clinching her little
fists at her side and edging towards him with a sidelong bantam-like
movement as she advanced her freckled cheek close to his with an
effrontery so like her absconding father that he recoiled before it."And a mean, double-faced hypocrite, too!Didn't you call him a Napoleon, and a--Moses?Didn't you say he was
the making of Canada City?Didn't you get him to raise your salary, and
start a subscription for your new house?Oh, you--you--stinking beast!"Here the stranger on the veranda, still gazing abstractedly at
the landscape, gave a low and apparently unconscious murmur, as if
enraptured with the view.Windibrook, recalled to an attempt at
dignity, took up his hat and handkerchief."When you have remembered
yourself and your position, Miss Trixit," he said loftily, "the offer I
have made you"--

"I despise it!I'd sooner stay in the woods with the grizzlies and
rattlesnakes?"Windibrook promptly retreated through the door and down the steps
into the garden, at which the stranger on the veranda reluctantly tore
himself away from the landscape and slowly entered the parlor through
the open French window.Here, however, he became equally absorbed and
abstracted in the condition of his beard, carefully stroking his shaven
cheek and lips and pulling his goatee.After a pause he turned to the angry Cissy, standing by the piano,
radiant with glowing cheeks and flashing eyes, and said slowly, "I
reckon you gave the parson as good as he sent.It kinder settles a man
to hear the frozen truth about himself sometimes, and you've helped old
Shadbelly considerably on the way towards salvation.But he was right
about one thing, Miss Trixit.The house IS in the hands of the law.I'm
representing it as deputy sheriff.Mebbe you might remember me--Jake
Poole--when your father was addressing the last Citizen's meeting,
sittin' next to him on the platform--I'M in possession.It isn't a job
I'm hankerin' much arter; I'd a lief rather hunt hoss thieves or track
down road agents than this kind o' fancy, underhand work.So you'll
excuse me, miss, if I ain't got the style."He paused, rubbed his chin
thoughtfully, and then said slowly and with great deliberation: "Ef
there's any little thing here, miss,--any keepsakes or such trifles
ez you keer for in partickler, things you wouldn't like strangers to
have,--you just make a little pile of 'em and drop 'em down somewhere
outside the back door.There ain't no inventory taken nor sealin' up
of anythin' done just yet, though I have to see there ain't anythin'
disturbed.But I kalkilate to walk out on that veranda for a spell
and look at the landscape."He paused again, and said, with a sigh of
satisfaction, "It's a mighty pooty view out thar; it just takes me every
time."As he turned and walked out through the French window, Cissy did not
for a moment comprehend him; then, strangely enough, his act of rude
courtesy for the first time awakened her to the full sense of the
situation.This house, her father's house, was no longer hers!If her
father should NEVER return, she wanted nothing from it, NOTHING!She
gripped her beating heart with the little hand she had clinched so
valiantly a moment ago.Some one had glided
noiselessly into the back room; a figure in a blue blouse; a Chinaman,
their house servant, Ah Fe.He cast a furtive glance at the stranger on
the veranda, and then beckoned to her stealthily.She came towards him
wonderingly, when he suddenly whipped a note from his sleeve, and with
a dexterous movement slipped it into her fingers.A
single glance showed her a small
