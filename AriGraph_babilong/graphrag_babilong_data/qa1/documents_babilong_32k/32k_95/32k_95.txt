In the lower
strata of air there was scarcely any wind, and the rain came down
vertically, copiously, and without beating violence.The sun-warmed earth
took in every drop like a great sponge.Beyond the first muttered warning to the little May party in the grove
there was no thunder.The patter of the rain was a gentle lullaby to Amy,
and at last she was wakened by a ray of sunlight playing upon her face,
yet she still heard the soft fall of rain.With the elasticity of youth,
she sprang up, feeling that the other cloud that had shadowed her
thoughts might soon pass also.As she went singing down the stairway,
Webb called from the front door: "Amy, look here!The cloud still hung heavily over the eastern
mountains, while against it was a magnificent arch, and so distinctly
defined that its feet appeared to rest on the two banks of the river.They watched it in silence until it faded away, and the whole scene,
crowned with flowers and opening foliage tinted like blossoms of varied
hues, was gemmed with crystals by the now unclouded sun, for the soft
rain had clung to everything, from the loftiest tree-top to the tiniest
spire of grass.Flame-like orioles were flashing through the perfumed
air.Robins, with their heads lifted heavenward, were singing as
rapturously as if they were saints rather than rollicking gormandizers.Every bird that had a voice was lifting it up in thanksgiving, but clear,
sweet, and distinct above them all came the notes of the wood-thrush,
with his Beethoven-like melody."Have you no words for a scene like this, Webb?"My wonder
exceeds even my admiration, for the greater part of this infinite variety
of beauty is created out of so few materials and by so simple yet
mysterious a method that I can scarcely believe it, although I see it and
know it.Men have always agreed to worship the genius which could achieve
the most with the least.And yet the basis of nearly all we see is a
microscopic cell endowed with essential powers.That large apple-tree
yonder, whose buds are becoming so pink, started from one of these minute
cells, and all the growth, beauty, and fruitfulness since attained were
the result of the power of this one cell to add to itself myriads of like
cells, which form the whole structure.It is cell adding cells that is
transforming the world around us."He spoke earnestly, and almost as if
he were thinking aloud, and he looked like one in the presence of a
mystery that awed him.The hue of Amy's eyes deepened, and her face
flushed in her quickened interest.Her own mind had been turning to
kindred thoughts and questionings.She had passed beyond the period when
a mind like hers could be satisfied with the mere surface of things, and
Webb's direct approach to the very foundation principles of what she saw
sent a thrill through all her nerves as an heroic deed would have done."Can you not show me one of those cells with your microscope?""Yes, easily, and some of its contents through the cell's transparent
walls, as, for instance, the minute grains of _chlorophyll_, that is, the
green of leaves.All the hues of foliage and flowers are caused by what
the cells contain, and these, to a certain extent, can be seen and
analyzed.But there is one thing within the cell which I cannot show you,
and which has never been seen, and yet it accounts for everything, and is
the architect of all--life.When we reach the cell we are at the
threshold of this mysterious presence.We can
see its work, for its workshop is under our eye, and in this minute shop
it is building all the vegetation of the world, but the artisan itself
ever remains invisible.""Ah, Webb, do not say artisan, but rather artist.Does not the beauty all
around us prove it?Surely there is but one explanation, the one papa
taught me: it is the power of God.He is in the little as well as in the
great."Well, Amy," he replied, smilingly, "the faith taught you by your father
is, to my mind, more rational than any of the explanations that I have
read, and I have studied several.But then I know little, indeed,
compared with multitudes of others.I am sure, however, that the life of
God is in some way the source of all the life we see.But perplexing
questions arise on every side.Much of life is so repulsive and noxious--
But there!what a fog-bank I am leading you into this crystal May
evening!Most young girls would vote me an insufferable bore should I
talk to them in this style.""So much the worse for the young girls then.I should think they would
feel that no compliment could exceed that of being talked to as if they
had brains.But I do not wish to put on learned airs.You know how
ignorant I am of even the beginnings of this knowledge.All that I can
say is that I am not content to be ignorant.Mary went back to the hallway.The curiosity of Mother Eve
is growing stronger every day; and is it strange that it should turn
toward the objects, so beautiful and yet so mysterious, that meet my eyes
on every side?""No," said he, musingly, "the strange thing is that people have so little
curiosity in regard to their surroundings.Why, multitudes of intelligent
persons are almost as indifferent as the cattle that browse around among
the trees and flowers.I once used to
investigate things, but did not see them.I have thought about it very
much this spring.It is said that great painters and sculptors study
anatomy as well as outward form.Perhaps here is a good hint for those
who are trying to appreciate nature.I am not so shallow as to imagine
that I can ever understand nature any more than I can you with your
direct, honest gaze.So to the thoughtful mystery is ever close at hand,
but it seems no little thing to trace back what one sees as far as one
can, and you have made me feel that it is a great thing to see the Divine
Artist's finished work."They were now joined by others, and the perfect beauty of the evening as
it slowly faded into night attracted much attention from all the family.The new moon hung in the afterglow of the western sky, and as the dusk
deepened the weird notes of the whip-poor-will were heard for the first
time from the mountain-sides.At the supper-table Leonard beamed on every one."A rain like this, after
a week of sunshine has warmed the earth" he exclaimed, "is worth millions
to the country."Yes," added his father, "the old Indian sign, the unfolding of the oak
leaves, indicates that it is now safe to plant.After long years of observation I am satisfied that the true secret
of success in farming is the doing of everything at just the right time.Crops put in too early or too late often partially fail; but if the right
conditions are complied with from the beginning, they start with a vigor
which is not lost until maturity."Burt indulged in a gayety that was phenomenal even for him, but after
supper he disappeared.Amy retired to her room early, but she sat a long
time at her window and looked out into the warm, fragrant night.She had
forgotten poor Burt, who was thinking of her, as in his unrest he rode
mile after mile, holding his spirited horse down to a walk.She had
almost forgotten Webb, but she thought deeply of his words, of the life
that was working all around her so silently and yet so powerfully.Unseen
it had created the beauty she had enjoyed that day.From the very
contrast of ideas it made her think of death, of her father, who once had
been so strong and full of life.The mystery of one seemed as great as
that of the other, and a loneliness such as she had not felt before for
months depressed her."I wish I could talk to Webb again," she thought."He says he does not
understand me.It would seem
that when one began to think nothing that appeared simple before is
understood; but his words are strong and assured.He leads one to the
boundaries of the known, and then says, quietly, we can go no further;
but he makes you feel that what is beyond is all right.Oh, I wish Burt
was like him!"CHAPTER XXX

SPRING-TIME PASSION


But little chance had Amy to talk with Webb for the next few days.He had
seen the cloud on Burt's brow, and had observed that he was suspicious,
unhappy, and irritable; that reason and good sense were not in the
ascendant; and he understood his brother sufficiently well to believe
that his attack must run its natural course, as like fevers had done
before.From what he had seen he also thought that Amy could deal with
Burt better than any one else, for although high-strung, he was also
manly and generous when once he got his bearings.In his present mood he
would bitterly resent interference from any one, but would be bound to
obey Amy and to respect her wishes.Therefore he took especial pains to
be most kindly, but also to appear busy and pre-occupied.It must not be thought that Burt was offensive or even openly obtrusive
in his attentions.He was far too well-bred for that.There was nothing
for which even his mother could reprove him, or of which Amy herself
could complain.It was the suit itself from which she shrank, or rather
which she would put off indefinitely.But Burt was not disposed to put
anything that he craved into the distance.Spring-tide impulses were in
his veins, and his heart was so overcharged that it must find expression.A long, exquisite day had merged into
a moonlight evening.The apple-blossoms were in all their white-and-pink
glory, and filled the summer-like air with a fragrance as delicate as
that of the arbutus.The petals of the cherry were floating down like
snow in every passing breeze, glimmering momentarily in the pale
radiance.The night was growing so beautiful that Amy was tempted to
stroll out in the grounds, and soon she yielded to a fancy to see the
effect of moonlight through an apple-tree that towered like a mound of
snow at some little distance from the house.She would not have been
human had the witchery of the May evening been without its influence.If
Burt could have understood her, this was his opportunity.If he had come
with step and tone that accorded with the quiet evening, and simply said,
"Amy, you know--you have seen that I love you; what hope can you give
me?"she in her present mood would have answered him as gently and
frankly as a child.She might have laughingly pointed him to the tree,
and said: "See, it is in blossom now.It will be a long time before you
pick the apples.If you will be sensible, and treat me as
you would Johnnie, were she older, I will ride and walk with you, and be
as nice to you as I can."But this Burt could not do and still remain Burt.He was like an
overcharged cloud, and when he spoke at last his words seemed to the
sensitive girl to have the vividness and abruptness of the lightning.It
was her custom to make a special toilet for the evening, and when she had
come down to supper with a rose in her hair, and dressed in some light
clinging fabric, she had proved so attractive to the young fellow that he
felt that the limit of his restraint was reached.He would appeal to her
so earnestly, so passionately, as to kindle her cold nature.In his lack
of appreciation of Amy he had come to deem this his true course, and she
unconsciously enabled him to carry out the rash plan.He had seen her
stroll away, and had followed her until she should be so far from the
house that she must listen.As she emerged from under the apple-tree,
through which as a white cloud she had been looking at the moon, he
appeared so suddenly as to startle her, and without any gentle reassurance
he seized her hand, and poured out his feelings in a way that at first
wounded and frightened her."Burt," she cried, "why do you speak to me so?Can't you see that I do
not feel as you do?I've given you no reason to say such words to me."Are you as cold and elusive as this moonlight?I
have waited patiently, and now I must and will speak.Every man has a
right to speak and a right to an answer.""Well then," she replied, her spirit rising; "if you will insist on my
being a woman instead of a young girl just coming from the shadow of a
great sorrow, I also have my rights.I've tried to show you gently and
with all the tact I possessed that I did not want to think about such
things.I'm just at the beginning of my girlhood and I want to be a young
girl as long as I can and not an engaged young woman.No matter who spoke
the words you have said, they would pain me.Why couldn't you see this
from my manner and save both yourself and me from this scene?I'll gladly
be your loving sister, but you must not speak to me in this way again.""You refuse me then," he said, throwing back his head haughtily.I simply tell you that I won't listen to such words from
any one.Why can't you be sensible and understand me?I no more wish to
talk about such things than do Alf and Johnnie.""I do understand you," he exclaimed, passionately, "and better perhaps
than you understand yourself.You are a woman, but
you seem to lack a woman's heart, as far as I am concerned;" and with a
gesture that was very tragic and despairing he strode away.She was deeply troubled and incensed also, and she returned to the house
with drooping head and fast-falling tears."Why, Amy, what is the matter?"Looking up, she saw Webb coming down the
piazza steps.Yielding to her impulse, she sprang forward and took his
arm, as she said:

"Webb, you have always acted toward me like a brother.is it unnatural in me that I do not wish to hear
such words as Burt would speak to-night?All I ask is that he will let me
stay a happy young girl till I am ready for something else.This is no
way for a flower to bloom"--she snatched the rose from her hair, and
pushed open the red petals--"and yet Burt expects me to respond at once
to feelings that I do not even understand.If it's best in the future--but
surely I've a right to my freedom for a long time yet.Tell me, do you
think I'm unnatural?""No, Amy," he answered, gently."It is because you are so perfectly
natural, so true to your girlhood, that you feel as you do.In that
little parable of the rose you explain yourself fully.You have no cause
for self-reproach, nor has Burt for complaint.You say you do not understand me, and yet always prove that
you do.If Burt would only treat me as you do, I should be perfectly
happy.""Well, Burt's good-hearted, but sometimes he mislays his judgment," said
Webb, laughing.There is no occasion for any high
tragedy on his part or for grieving on yours.You go and tell mother all
about it, and just how you feel.She is the right one to manage this
affair, and her influence over Burt is almost unbounded.Do this, and,
take my word for it, all will soon be serene."Amy felt that night what it is to have a mother's
boundless love and sympathy, and she went to her rest comforted, soothed,
and more assured as to the future than she had been for a long time."How
quiet and sensible Webb was about it all!"was her last smiling thought
before she slept.His thought as he strolled away in the moonlight after
she left him was, "It is just as if I half believed.She has the mind of
a woman, but the heart of a child.Burt did not stroll; he strode mile after mile, and the uncomfortable
feeling that he had been very unwise, to say the least, and perhaps very
unjust, was growing upon him.When at last he returned, his mother called
to him through the open door.Clifford always
obtained the confidence of her children, and they ever found that it was
sacred.All that can be said, therefore, was, that he came from her
presence penitent, ashamed, and hopeful.His mood may best be explained,
perhaps, by a note written before he retired."My dear sister Amy," it
ran, "I wish to ask your pardon.I was
so blinded and engrossed by my own feelings that I did not understand
you.I have proved myself unworthy of even a sister's love; but I will
try to make amends.Do not judge me harshly because I was so headlong.There is no use in trying to disguise the truth.What I have said so
unwisely and prematurely I cannot unsay, and I shall always be true to my
words.But I will wait patiently as long as you please; and if you find,
in future years, that you cannot feel as I do, I will not complain or
blame you, however sad the truth may be to me.In the meantime, let there
be no constraint between us.Let me become once more your trusted brother
Burt."This note he pushed under her door, and then slept too soundly for
the blighted youth he had a few hours before deemed himself.He felt a little embarrassed at the prospect of meeting her the next
morning, but she broke the ice at once by coming to him on the piazza and
extending her hand in smiling frankness as she said: "You are neither
unjust nor ungenerous, Burt, or you would not have written me such a
note.As you said the first evening I came, we
shall have jolly times together."The young fellow was immensely relieved and grateful, and he showed it.Soon afterward he went about the affairs of the day happier than he had
been for a long time.Indeed, it soon became evident that his explosion
on the previous evening had cleared the air generally.Amy felt that the
one threatening cloud had sunk below the horizon.As the days passed, and
Burt proved that he could keep his promise, her thoughts grew as serene
as those of Johnnie.Her household duties were not very many, and yet she
did certain things regularly.The old people found that she rarely forgot
them, and she had the grace to see when she could help and cheer.Attentions that must be constantly asked for have little charm.A day
rarely passed that did she not give one or more of its best hours to her
music and drawing; for, while she never expected to excel in these arts,
she had already learned that they would enable her to give much pleasure
to others.Her pencil, also, was of great assistance in her study of
out-door life, for the fixed attention which it required to draw a plant,
tree, or bit of scenery revealed its characteristics.She had been even
more interested in the unfolding of the leaf-buds than in the flowering
of the trees, and the gradual advance of the foliage, like a tinted
cloud, up the mountain-<DW72>s, was something she never tired of watching.When she spoke of this one day to Webb, he replied:

"I have often wondered that more is not said and written about our spring
foliage, before it passes into its general hue of green.To me it has a
more delicate beauty and charm than anything seen in October.Different
trees have their distinct coloring now as then, but it is evanescent, and
the shades usually are less clearly marked.This very fact, however,
teaches the eye to have a nicety of distinction that is pleasing."The blossoms faded from the trees, and
the miniature fruit was soon apparent.The strawberry rows, that had been
like lines of snow, were now full of little promising cones.The grass
grew so lusty and strong that the dandelions were hidden except as the
breeze caught up the winged seeds that the tuneful yellow-birds often
seized in the air.The rye had almost reached its height, and Johnnie
said it was "as good as going to the ocean to see it wave."At last the
swelling buds on the rose-bushes proclaimed the advent of June.CHAPTER XXXI

JUNE AND HONEY-BEES


It is said that there is no heaven anywhere for those incapable of
recognizing and enjoying it.Be this as it may, the month of June is a
segment of heaven annually bestowed on those whose eyes and ears have been
opened to beauty in sight and sound.Indeed, what sense in man is not
gratified to the point of imaginary perfection during this early fruition
of the varied promise of spring?Even to the sense of touch, how exquisite
is the "feel" of the fragrant rose-petals, the soft young foliage that has
transformed the world, and the queer downy fledglings in innumerable nests!To the eye informed by a heart in love with nature the longest days of the
year are all too short to note half that exists and takes place.Who sees
and distinguishes the varied blossoming of the many kinds of grain and
grasses that are waving in every field?And yet here is a beauty as
distinct and delicate as can be found in some of Mendelssohn's "Songs
without Words"--blossomings so odd, delicate, and evanescent as to suggest
a child's dream of a flower.Place them under a strong glass, and who can
fail to wonder at the miracles of form and color that are revealed?From
these tiny flowerets the scale runs upward until it touches the hybrid
rose.During this period, also, many of the forest trees emulate the wild
flowers at their feet until their inflorescence culminates in the white
cord-like fringe that foretells the spiny chestnut burrs.So much has been written comparing this exquisite season when spring
passes insensibly into summer with the fulfilled prophecy of girlhood,
that no attempt shall be made to repeat the simile.Amy's birthday should
have been in May, but it came early in June.May was still in her heart,
and might linger there indefinitely; but her mind, her thoughts, kept
pace with nature as unconsciously as the flowers that bloomed in their
season.There were little remembrances from all the family, but Webb's
gift promised the most pleasure.It was a powerful opera-glass; and as he
handed it to her on the piazza in the early morning he said:

"Our troupe are all here now, Amy, and I thought that you would like to
see the singers, and observe their costumes and expressions.Some birds
have a good deal of expression and a very charming manner while singing--a
manner much more to my taste than that of many a _prima donna_ whom I
have heard, although my taste may be uncultivated.Focus your glass on that
indigo-bird in yonder tree-top.Don't you see him?--the one that is
favoring us with such a lively strain, beginning with a repetition of
short, sprightly notes.The glass may enable you to see his markings
accurately."and it grows so deep and rich about
the head, throat, and breast!How plain I can see him, even to the black
velvet under his eyes!John moved to the garden.Why, I can look
right into his little throat, and almost imagine I see the notes he is
flinging abroad so vivaciously.I can even make out his claws closed on a
twig, and the dew on the leaves around him is like gems.Truly, Webb, you
were inspired when you thought of this gift.""Yes," he replied, quietly, looking much pleased, however, "with a very
honest wish to add to your enjoyment of the summer.I must confess, too,
that I had one thought at least for myself.You have described the
indigo-bird far more accurately than I could have done, although I have
seen it every summer as long as I can remember.You have taught me to
see; why should I not help you to see more when I can do it so easily?My
thought was that you would lend me the glass occasionally, so that I
might try to keep pace with you.I've been using the microscope too
much--prying into nature, as Burt would say, with the spirit of an
anatomist.""I shall value the glass a great deal more if you share it with me," she
said, simply, with a sincere, direct gaze into his eyes; "and be assured,
Webb," she added, earnestly, "you are helping me more than I can help
you.I'm not an artist, and never can be, but if I were I should want
something more than mere surface, however beautiful it might be.Think of
it, Webb, I'm eighteen to-day, and I know so little!You always make me
feel that there is so much to learn, and, what is more, that it is worth
knowing.You should have been a teacher, for you would make the children
feel, when learning their lessons, as Alf does when after game.she added, sweeping the scene with her
glass."I can go every day now on an exploring expedition.Clifford came in a little late, rubbing his hands felicitously, as he
said:

"I have just come from the apiary, and think we shall have another swarm
to-day.Did you ever hear the old saying, Amy,

  'A swarm of bees in June
   Is worth a silver spoon'?Sandra moved to the kitchen.If one comes out to-day, and we hive it safely, we shall call it yours, and
you shall have the honey.""How much you are all doing to sweeten my life!"she said, laughing; "but I
never expected the present of a swarm of bees.I assure you it is a gift
that you will have to keep for me, and yet I should like to see how the
bees swarm, and how you hive them.I've heard that bees
are so wise, and know when people are afraid of them.""You can fix yourself up with a thick veil and a pair of gloves so that
there will be no danger, and your swarm of bees, when once in hive, will
take care of themselves, and help take care of you.That's the beauty of
bee-culture.""Our bees are literally in clover this year," Leonard remarked."That heavy
coating of wood-ashes that I gave to a half-acre near the apiary proved
most effective, and the plot now looks as if a flurry of snow had passed
over it, the white clover blossoms are so thick.That is something I could
never understand, Webb.Wood-ashes will always bring white clover.It's
hard to believe that it all comes from seed dormant in the ground.""Well, it does," was the reply."A great many think that the ashes simply produce conditions in the soil
which generate the clover."That would not be simple at all, and if any one could
prove it he would make a sensation in the scientific world.""Now, Len, here's your chance," laughed Burt."Just imagine what a halo of
glory you would get by setting the scientific world agape with wonder!""I could make the scientific world gape in a much easier way," Leonard
replied, dryly."Well, Amy, if you are as fond of honey as I am, you will
think a swarm of bees a very nice present.Fancy buckwheat cakes eaten with
honey made from buckwheat blossoms!There's a conjunction that gives to
winter an unflagging charm.If the old Hebrews felt as I do, a land flowing
with milk and honey must have been very alluring.Such a land the valley of
the Hudson certainly is.It's one of the finest grass regions of the world,
and grass means milk; and the extensive raspberry fields along its banks
mean honey.White clover is all very well, but I've noticed that when the
raspberry-bushes are in bloom they are alive with bees.I believe even the
locust-trees would be deserted for these insignificant little blossoms
that, like many plain people, are well worth close acquaintance.""The linden-tree, which also blooms this month," added Webb, "furnishes the
richest harvest for the honeybees, and I don't believe they would leave its
blossoms for any others.I wish there were more lindens in this region, for
they are as ornamental as they are useful.I've read that they are largely
cultivated in Russia for the sake of the bees.Mary moved to the office.The honey made from the
linden or bass-wood blossoms is said to be crystal in its transparency, and
unsurpassed in delicacy of flavor."Clifford, "I shall look after the apiary to-day.That's
good lazy work for an old man.You can help me watch at a safe distance,
Amy, and protected, as I said, if they swarm.It wouldn't be well for you
to go too near the hives at first, you know," he added, in laughing
gallantry, "for they might mistake you for a flower.They are so well
acquainted with me that I raise neither expectations nor fears.You needn't
come out before ten o'clock, for they don't swarm until toward midday."With shy steps, and well protected, Amy approached the apiary, near which
the old gentleman was sitting in placid fearlessness under the shade of a
maple, the honey of whose spring blossoms was already in the hive.For a
time she kept at a most respectful distance, but, as the bees did not
notice her, she at last drew nearer, and removed her veil, and with the aid
of her glass saw the indefatigable workers coming in and going out with
such celerity that they seemed to be assuring each other that there were
tons of honey now to be had for the gathering.The bees grew into large
insects under her powerful lenses, and their forms and movements were very
distinct.Suddenly from the entrance of one hive near Mr.Clifford, which
she happened to be covering with her glass, she saw pouring out a perfect
torrent of bees.She started back in affright, but Mr.Clifford told her to
stand still, and she noted that he quietly kept his seat, while following
through his gold-rimmed spectacles the swirling, swaying stream that rushed
into the upper air.The combined hum smote the ear with its intensity.Each
bee was describing circles with almost the swiftness of light, and there
were such numbers that they formed a nebulous living mass.Involuntarily
she crouched down in the grass.In a few moments, however, she saw the
swarm draw together and cluster like a great black ball on a bough of a
small pear-tree.The queen had alighted, and all her subjects gathered
around her."Ah," chuckled the old gentleman, rising quietly, "they couldn't have been
more sensible if they had been human--not half so sensible in that case,
perhaps.I think you will have your swarm now without doubt.That's the
beauty of these Italian bees when they are kept pure: they are so quiet and
sensible.Come away now, until I return prepared to hive them."The young girl obeyed with alacrity, and was almost trembling with
excitement, to which fear as well as the novelty of the scene contributed
not a little.Clifford soon returned, well protected and prepared for
his work.Taking an empty hive, he placed it on the ground in a secluded
spot, and laid before its entrances a broad, smooth board.Then he mounted
a step-ladder, holding in his left hand a large tin pan, and gently brushed
the bees into it as if they had been inanimate things.A sheet had first
been spread beneath the pear-tree to catch those that did not fall into the
pan.Touched thus gently and carefully, the immense vitality of the swarm
remained dormant; but a rough, sudden movement would have transformed it
instantly into a vengeful cloud of insects, each animated by the one
impulse to use its stiletto.Corning down from the ladder he turned the pan
toward Amy, and with her glass she saw that it was nearly half full of a
crawling, seething mass that fairly made her shudder.But much experience
rendered the old gentleman confident, and he only smiled as he carried the
pan of bees to the empty hive, and poured them out on the board before it.The sheet was next gathered up and placed near the hive also, and then the
old gentleman backed slowly and quietly away until he had joined Amy, to
whom he said, "My part of the work is now done, and I think we shall soon
see them enter the hive."He was right, for within twenty minutes every bee
had disappeared within the new domicile."To-night I will place the hive on
the platform with the others, and to-morrow your bees will be at work for
you, Amy.I don't wonder you are so interested, for of all insects I think
bees take the palm.It is possible that the swarm will not fancy their new
quarters, and will come out again, but it is not probable.Screened by this
bush, you can watch in perfect safety;" and he left her well content, with
her glass fixed on the apiary.Having satisfied herself for the time with observing the workers coming and
going, she went around to the white clover-field to see the process of
gathering the honey.She had long since learned that bees while at work are
harmless, unless so cornered that they sting in self-defence.Sitting on a
rock at the edge of the clover-field, she listened to the drowsy monotone
of innumerable wings.Then she bent her glass on a clover head, and it grew
at once into a collection of little white tubes or jars in which from
earth, air, and dew nature distilled the nectar that the bees were
gathering.The intent workers stood on their heads and emptied these
fragrant honey-jars with marvellous quickness.They knew when they were
loaded, and in straight lines as geometrically true as the hexagon cells in
which the honey would be stored they darted to their hives.When the day
grew warm she returned to the house and read, with a wonder and delight
which no fairy tale had ever produced, John Burroughs's paper, "The
Pastoral Bees," which Webb had found for her before going to his work.To
her childish credulity fairy lore had been more interesting than wonderful,
but the instincts and habits of these children of nature touched on
mysteries that can never be solved.At dinner the experiences of the apiary were discussed, and Leonard asked,
"Do you think the old-fashioned custom of beating tin pans and blowing
horns influences a swarm to alight?The custom is still maintained by some
people in the vicinity.""It is no longer practiced by scientific
bee-keepers, and yet it is founded on the principle that anything which
disconcerts the bees may change their plans.It is said that water or dry
earth thrown into a whirling swarm will sometimes cause it to alight or
return to the hive.""Your speaking of blowing horns," said Mr.Clifford, laughing, "recalls a
hiving experience that occurred seventy years ago.I was a boy then, but
was so punctured with stings on a June day like this that a vivid
impression was made on my memory.A
neighbor, a quaint old man who lived very near, had gained the reputation
of an expert at this business.I can see him now, with his high stove-pipe
hat, and his gnarled, wrinkled visage, which he shrouded in a green veil
when hiving a swarm.He was a good-hearted old fellow, but very rough in
his talk.He had been to sea in early life, and profanity had become the
characteristic of his vernacular.Well, word came one morning that the bees
were swarming, and a minute later I aroused the old man, who was smoking
and dozing on his porch.I don't believe you ever ran faster, Alf, than I
did then.Hiving bees was the old fellow's hobby and pride, and he dived
into his cottage, smashing his clay pipe on the way, with the haste of an
attacked soldier seizing his weapons.In a moment he was out with all his
paraphernalia.To me was given a fish-horn of portentous size and sound.The'skips,' which were the old fashioned straw hives that the bears so
often emptied for our forefathers, stood in a large door-yard, over which
the swarm was circling.As we arrived on the scene the women were coming
from the house with tin pans, and nearly all the family were out-of-doors.It so happened that an old white horse was grazing in the yard, and at this
critical moment was near the end of the bench on which stood the hives.Coming up behind him, I thoughtlessly let off a terrific blast from my
horn, at which he, terrified, kicked viciously.Over went a straw skip, and
in a moment we had another swarm of bees on hand that we had not bargained
for.Dropping my horn, I covered my face with my arm, and ran for life to
the house, but I must have been stung twenty times before I escaped.The
bees seemed everywhere, and as mad as hornets.Although half wild with
pain, I had to laugh as I saw the old man frantically trying to adjust his
veil, meanwhile almost dancing in his anguish.In half a minute he
succumbed, and tore into a wood-shed.Everybody went to cover instantly
except the white horse, and he had nowhere to go, but galloped around the
yard as if possessed.This only made matters worse, for innocent as he was,
the bees justly regarded him as the cause of all the trouble.At last, in
his uncontrollable agony, he floundered over a stone wall, and disappeared.For an hour or two it was almost as much as one's life was worth to venture
out.The old man, shrouded and mittened, at last crept off homeward to
nurse his wounds and his wrath, and he made the air fairly sulphurous
around him with his oaths.But that kind of sulphuric treatment did not
affect the bees, for I observed from a window that at one point nearest the
skips he began to run, and he kept up a lively pace until within his door.What became of the swarm we expected to hive I do not know.That night we destroyed the irate swarm whose skip had
been kicked over, and peace was restored.""If you had told that story at the breakfast-table," said Amy, as soon as
the laugh caused by the old gentleman's account had subsided, "you could
never have induced me to be present this morning, even at such a respectful
distance.""An old man who lives not far from us has wonderful success with bees,"
Leonard remarked."He has over fifty hives in a space not more than twenty
feet square, and I do not think there is a tenth of an acre in his whole
lot, which is in the centre of a village.To this bare little plot his bees
bring honey from every side, so that for his purpose he practically owns
this entire region.He potters around them so much that, as far as he is
concerned, they are as docile as barn-door fowls, and he says he minds a
sting no more than a mosquito bite.There are half a dozen small trees and
bushes in his little yard, and his bees are so accommodating that they
rarely swarm elsewhere than on these low trees within a lew feet of the
skips.He also places mullein stalks on a pole, and the swarms often
cluster on them.He told me that on one day last summer he had ten swarms
to look after, and that he hived them all; and he says that his wife is as
good at the work as he is.On a pole which forms the corner of a little
poultry-coop he keeps the record of the swarms of each season, and for last
summer there are sixty-one notches.A year ago this month four swarms went
into a barrel that stood in a corner of his yard, and he left them there.By fall they had filled the barrel with honey, and then, in his vernacular,
he 'tuck it up'; that is, he killed the bees, and removed all the honey.""That is the regular bee-phrase in this region.If a hive is to be emptied
and the bees destroyed, or a bee tree to be cut down, the act is described
as 'taking up' the hive or tree," Burt explained."By the way, Amy," he
added, "we must give you a little bee-hunting experience in the mountains
next October.We can leave you with a
guard at some high point, when we strike a bee-line, and we might not be
long in finding the tree.""We'll put the expedition right down on the fall programme," she said,
smilingly.Clifford, she continued: "You spoke in
praise of Italian bees."Really only two distinct kinds--our native brownish-black bees, and the
Italians imported by Mr.S. B. Parsons and others about fifteen years ago.There is a cross or hybrid between these two kinds that are said to be so
ill-natured that it is unsafe to go anywhere near their hives.""Burt," said Webb, "you must remember reading in Virgil of the 'golden
bees.'""Yes, indistinctly; but none of them ever got in my bonnet or made much
impression.I don't like bees, nor do they like me.They respect only the
deliberation of profound gravity and wisdom.Father has these qualities by
the right of years, and Webb by nature, and their very presence soothes the
irascible insects; but when I go among them they fairly bristle with
stings.Give me a horse, and the more spirited the better.""Oh, no, Burt; can't give you any," said Leonard, with his humorous
twinkle."I'll sell you one, though, cheap.""Yes, that vicious, uncouth brute that you bought because so cheap.I told
you that you were'sold' at the same time with the horse.""I admit it," was the rueful reply."If he ever balks again as he did
to-day, I shall be tempted to shoot him."He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.Daniel moved to the office.[Illustration: (omnibus)]

He is telling the others of a spot he knows in Normandy, where one can
paint--full of quaint farm-houses, with thatched roofs; picturesque
roadsides, rich in foliage; bright waving fields, and cool green
woods, and purling streams; quaint gardens, choked with lavender and
roses and hollyhocks--and all this fair land running to the white sand
of the beach, with the blue sea beyond.He will write to old Pere
Jaqueline that they are all coming--it is just the place in which to
pose a model "en plein air,"--and Suzanne, his model, being a Normande
herself, grows enthusiastic at the thought of going down again to the
sea.Long before she became a Parisienne, and when her beautiful hair
was a tangled shock of curls, she used to go out in the big boats,
with the fisherwomen--barefooted, brown, and happy.She tells them of
those good days, and then they all go into the Taverne to dine, filled
with the idea of the new trip, and dreaming of dinners under the
trees, of "Tripes a la mode de Caen," Normandy cider, and a lot of new
sketches besides.[Illustration: (shop front)]

Already the tables within are well filled.The long room, with its newer
annex, is as brilliant as a jewel box--the walls rich in tiled panels
suggesting the life of the Quarter, the woodwork in gold and light oak,
the big panels of the rich gold ceiling exquisitely painted.At one of the tables two very chic young women are dining with a young
Frenchman, his hair and dress in close imitation of the Duc d'Orleans.A strikingly pretty woman, in a scarlet-spangled gown as red as her
lips, is dining with a well-built, soldierly-looking man in black; they
sit side by side as is the custom here.The woman reminds one of a red lizard--a salamander--her "svelte" body
seemingly boneless in its gown of clinging scales.Her hair is
purple-black and freshly onduled; her skin as white as ivory.She has
the habit of throwing back her small, well-posed head, while under their
delicately penciled lids her gray eyes take in the room at a glance.She is not of the Quarter, but the Taverne du Pantheon is a refuge for
her at times, when she grows tired of Paillard's and Maxim's and her
quarreling retinue."Let them howl on the other bank of the Seine," says this empress of
the half-world to herself, "I dine with Raoul where I please."And now one glittering, red arm with its small, heavily-jeweled hand
glides toward Raoul's open cigarette case, and in withdrawing a
cigarette she presses for a moment his big, strong hand as he holds near
her polished nails the flaming match.[Illustration: ALONG THE SEINE]

Her companion watches her as she smokes and talks--now and then he leans
closer to her, squaring his broad shoulders and bending lower his
strong, determined face, as he listens to her,--half-amused, replying to
her questions leisurely, in short, crisp sentences.Suddenly she stamps
one little foot savagely under the table, and, clenching her jeweled
hands, breathes heavily.She is trembling with rage; the man at her side
hunches his great shoulders, flicks the ashes from his cigarette, looks
at her keenly for a moment, and then smiles.In a moment she is herself
again, almost penitent; this little savage, half Roumanian, half
Russian, has never known what it was to be ruled!She has seen men grow
white when she has stamped her little foot, but this big Raoul, whom she
loves--who once held a garrison with a handful of men--he does not
tremble!she loves him for his devil-me-care indifference--and he enjoys
her temper.But the salamander remembers there are some whom she dominated, until
they groveled like slaves at her feet; even the great Russian nobleman
turned pale when she dictated to him archly and with the voice of an
angel the price of his freedom.he shot himself the next day," mused the salamander.Yes, and even the adamant old banker in Paris, crabbed, stern,
unrelenting to his debtors--shivered in his boots and ended in signing
away half his fortune to her, and moved his family into a permanent
chateau in the country, where he keeps himself busy with his shooting
and his books.*     *     *     *     *

As it grows late, the taverne becomes more and more animated.Every one is talking and having a good time.The room is bewildering in
gay color, the hum of conversation is everywhere, and as there is a
corresponding row of tables across the low, narrow room, friendly
greetings and often conversations are kept up from one side to the
other.The dinner, as it progresses, assumes the air of a big family
party of good bohemians.The French do not bring their misery with them
to the table.To dine is to enjoy oneself to the utmost; in fact the
French people cover their disappointment, sadness, annoyances, great or
petty troubles, under a masque of "blague," and have such an innate
dislike of sympathy or ridicule that they avoid it by turning
everything into "blague."This veneer is misleading, for at heart the French are sad.Not to speak
of their inmost feelings does not, on the other hand, prevent them at
times from being most confidential.Often, the merest exchange of
courtesies between those sharing the same compartment in a train, or a
seat on a "bus," seems to be a sufficient introduction for your neighbor
to tell you where he comes from, where he is going, whether he is
married or single, whom his daughter married, and what regiment his son
is in.These little confidences often end in his offering you half his
bottle of wine and extending to you his cigarettes.[Illustration: LES BEAUX MAQUEREAUX]

If you have finished dinner, you go out on the terrace for your coffee.The fakirs are passing up and down in front, selling their wares--little
rabbits, wonderfully lifelike, that can jump along your table and sit on
their hind legs, and wag their ears; toy snakes; small leaden pigs for
good luck; and novelties of every description.Here one sees women with
baskets of ecrivisse boiled scarlet; an acrobat tumbles on the
pavement, and two men and a girl, as a marine, a soldier, and a
vivandiere, in silvered faces and suits, pose in melodramatic attitudes.The vivandiere is rescued alternately from a speedy death by the marine
and the soldier.Presently a little old woman approaches, shriveled and smiling, in her
faded furbelows now in rags.She sings in a piping voice and executes
between the verses a tottering pas seul, her eyes ever smiling, as if
she still saw over the glare of the footlights, in the haze beyond, the
vast audience of by-gone days; smiling as if she still heard the big
orchestra and saw the leader with his vibrant baton, watching her every
movement.She is over seventy now, and was once a premier danseuse at
the opera.But you have not seen all of the Taverne du Pantheon yet.There is an
"American Bar" downstairs; at least, so the sign reads at the top of a
narrow stairway leading to a small, tavern-like room, with a sawdust
floor, heavy deal tables, and wooden stools.In front of the bar are
high stools that one climbs up on and has a lukewarm whisky soda, next
to Yvonne and Marcelle, who are both singing the latest catch of the day
at the top of their lungs, until they are howled at to keep still or are
lifted bodily off their high stools by the big fellow in the "type" hat,
who has just come in.[Illustration: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER]

Before a long table at one end of the room is the crowd of American
students singing in a chorus.The table is full now, for many have come
from dinners at other cafes to join them.At one end, and acting as
interlocutor for this impromptu minstrel show, presides one of the
best fellows in the world.He rises solemnly, his genial round face
wreathed in a subtle smile, and announces that he will sing, by earnest
request, that popular ballad, "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were
Singing in the Trees."There are some especially fine "barber chords" in this popular ditty,
and the words are so touching that it is repeated over and over again.Then it is sung softly like the farmhand quartettes do in the rural
melodrama outside the old homestead in harvest time.I tell you it's
a truly rural octette.Listen to that exhibition bass voice of Jimmy
Sands and that wandering tenor of Tommy Whiteing, and as the last chord
dies away (over the fields presumably) a shout goes up:

"How's that?""Out of sight," comes the general verdict from the crowd, and bang go a
dozen beer glasses in unison on the heavy table."Oh, que c'est beau!"cries Mimi, leading the successful chorus in a new
vocal number with Edmond's walking-stick; but this time it is a French
song and the whole room is singing it, including our old friend,
Monsieur Frank, the barkeeper, who is mixing one of his famous
concoctions which are never twice quite alike, but are better than if
they were.The harmonic beauties of "'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were Singing
in the Trees" are still inexhausted, but it sadly needs a piano
accompaniment--with this it would be perfect; and so the whole crowd,
including Yvonne, and Celeste, and Marcelle, and the two Frenchmen, and
the girl in the bicycle clothes, start for Jack Thompson's studio in the
rue des Fourneaux, where there is a piano that, even if the candles in
the little Louis XVI brackets do burn low and spill down the keys, and
the punch rusts the strings, it will still retain that beautiful, rich
tone that every French upright, at seven francs a month, possesses.[Illustration: (Bullier)]

CHAPTER III

THE "BAL BULLIER"


There are all types of "bals" in Paris.Over in Montmartre, on the Place
Blanche, is the well-known "Moulin Rouge," a place suggestive, to those
who have never seen it, of the quintessence of Parisian devil-me-care
gaiety.You expect it to be like those clever pen-and-ink drawings of
Grevin's, of the old Jardin Mabille in its palmiest days, brilliant with
lights and beautiful women extravagantly gowned and bejeweled.You
expect to see Frenchmen, too, in pot-hats, crowding in a circle about
Fifine, who is dancing some mad can-can, half hidden in a swirl of point
lace, her small, polished boots alternately poised above her dainty
head.And when she has finished, you expect her to be carried off to
supper at the Maison Doree by the big, fierce-looking Russian who has
been watching her, and whose victoria, with its spanking team--black and
glossy as satin--champing their silver bits outside, awaiting her
pleasure.But in all these anticipations you will be disappointed, for the famous
Jardin Mabille is no more, and the ground where it once stood in the
Champs Elysees is now built up with private residences.Fifine is gone,
too--years ago--and most of the old gentlemen in pot-hats who used to
watch her are buried or about to be.Few Frenchmen ever go to the
"Moulin Rouge," but every American does on his first night in Paris, and
emerges with enough cab fare to return him to his hotel, where he
arrives with the positive conviction that the red mill, with its slowly
revolving sails, lurid in crimson lights, was constructed especially for
him.He remembers, too, his first impressions of Paris that very morning
as his train rolled into the Gare St.His aunt could wait until
to-morrow to see the tomb of Napoleon, but he would see the "Moulin
Rouge" first, and to be in ample time ordered dinner early in his
expensive, morgue-like hotel.I remember once, a few hours after my arrival in Paris, walking up the
long hill to the Place Blanche at 2 P.M., under a blazing July sun, to
see if they did not give a matinee at the "Moulin Rouge."The place was
closed, it is needless to say, and the policeman I found pacing his beat
outside, when I asked him what day they gave a matinee, put his thumbs
in his sword belt, looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then
roared.The "Moulin Rouge" is in full blast every night; in the day-time
it is being aired.Farther up in Montmartre, up a steep, cobbly hill, past quaint little
shops and cafes, the hill becoming so steep that your cab horse
finally refuses to climb further, and you get out and walk up to the
"Moulin de la Galette."You find it a far different type of ball from
the "Moulin Rouge," for it is not made for the stranger, and its
clientele is composed of the rougher element of that quarter.[Illustration: (street scene)]

A few years ago the "Galette" was not the safest of places for a
stranger to go to alone.Since then, however, this ancient granary and
mill, that has served as a ball-room for so many years, has undergone a
radical change in management; but it is still a cliquey place, full of a
lot of habitues who regard a stranger as an intruder.Should you by
accident step on Marcelle's dress or jostle her villainous-looking
escort, you will be apt to get into a row, beginning with a mode of
attack you are possibly ignorant of, for these "maquereaux" fight with
their feet, having developed this "manly art" of self-defense to a point
of dexterity more to be evaded than admired.And while Marcelle's
escort, with a swinging kick, smashes your nose with his heel, his pals
will take the opportunity to kick you in the back.So, if you go to the "Galette," go with a Parisian or some of the
students of the Quarter; but if you must go alone--keep your eyes on the
band.It is a good band, too, and its chef d'orchestre, besides being a
clever musical director, is a popular composer as well.Go out from the ball-room into the tiny garden and up the ladder-like
stairs to the rock above, crowned with the old windmill, and look over
the iron railing.Far below you, swimming in a faint mist under the
summer stars, all Paris lies glittering at your feet.*     *     *     *     *

You will find the "Bal Bullier" of the Latin Quarter far different from
the "bals" of Montmartre.It forms, with its "grand fete" on Thursday
nights, a sort of social event of the week in this Quarter of Bohemians,
just as the Friday afternoon promenade does in the Luxembourg garden.If you dine at the Taverne du Pantheon on a Thursday night you will find
that the taverne is half deserted by 10 o'clock, and that every one is
leaving and walking up the "Boul' Miche" toward the "Bullier."Follow
them, and as you reach the place l'Observatoire, and turn a sharp corner
to the left, you will see the facade of this famous ball, illumined by a
sizzling blue electric light over the entrance.The facade, with its colored bas-reliefs of students and grisettes,
reminds one of the proscenium of a toy theater.Back of this shallow
wall bristle the tops of the trees in the garden adjoining the big
ball-room, both of which are below the level of the street and are
reached by a broad wooden stairway.The "Bal Bullier" was founded in 1847; previous to this there existed
the "Closerie des Lilas" on the Boulevard Montparnasse.You pass along
with the line of waiting poets and artists, buy a green ticket for two
francs at the little cubby-hole of a box-office, are divested of your
stick by one of half a dozen white-capped matrons at the vestiaire, hand
your ticket to an elderly gentleman in a silk hat and funereal clothes,
at the top of the stairway sentineled by a guard of two soldiers, and
the next instant you see the ball in full swing below you.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

There is nothing disappointing about the "Bal Bullier."It is all you
expected it to be, and more, too.Below you is a veritable whirlpool of
girls and students--a vast sea of heads, and a dazzling display of
colors and lights and animation.Little shrieks and screams fill your
ears, as the orchestra crashes into the last page of a galop, quickening
the pace until Yvonne's little feet slip and her cheeks glow, and her
eyes grow bright, and half her pretty golden hair gets smashed over her
impudent little nose.Then the galop is brought up with a quick finish.comes from every quarter of the big room, and
the conductor, with his traditional good-nature, begins again.He knows
it is wiser to humor them, and off they go again, still faster, until
all are out of breath and rush into the garden for a breath of cool air
and a "citron glace."And what a pretty garden it is!--full of beautiful trees and dotted with
round iron tables, and laid out in white gravel walks, the garden
sloping gently back to a fountain, and a grotto and an artificial
cascade all in one, with a figure of Venus in the center, over which the
water splashes and trickles.There is a green lattice proscenium, too,
surrounding the fountain, illuminated with colored lights and outlined
in tiny flames of gas, and grotto-like alcoves circling the garden, each
with a table and room for two.The ball-room from the garden presents a
brilliant contrast, as one looks down upon it from under the trees.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

But the orchestra has given its signal--a short bugle call announcing a
quadrille; and those in the garden are running down into the ball-room
to hunt up their partners.The "Bullier" orchestra will interest you; they play with a snap and
fire and a tempo that is irresistible.They have played together so long
that they have become known as the best of all the bal orchestras.The leader, too, is interesting--tall and gaunt, with wild, deep-sunken
eyes resembling those of an old eagle.Now and then he turns his head
slowly as he leads, and rests these keen, penetrating orbs on the sea of
dancers below him.Then, with baton raised above his head, he brings his
orchestra into the wild finale of the quadrille--piccolos and clarinets,
cymbals, bass viols, and violins--all in one mad race to the end, but so
well trained that not a note is lost in the scramble--and they finish
under the wire to a man, amid cheers from Mimi and Celeste and "encores"
and "bis's" from every one else who has breath enough left to shout
with.[Illustration: A TYPE OF THE QUARTER
By Helleu.--Estampe Moderne]

Often after an annual dinner of one of the ateliers, the entire body of
students will march into the "Bullier," three hundred strong, and take a
good-natured possession of the place.There have been some serious
demonstrations in the Quarter by the students, who can form a small army
when combined.But as a rule you will find them a good-natured lot of
fellows, who are out for all the humor and fun they can create at the
least expense.But in June, 1893, a serious demonstration by the students occurred, for
these students can fight as well as dance.Senator Beranger, having
read one morning in the "Courrier Francais" an account of the revelry
and nudity of several of the best-known models of the Quarter at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball, brought a charge against the organizers of the
ball, and several of the models, whose beauty unadorned had made them
conspicuous on this most festive occasion.At the ensuing trial, several
celebrated beauties and idols of the Latin Quarter were convicted and
sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, and fined a hundred francs
each.These sentences were, however, remitted, but the majority of the
students would not have it thus, and wanted further satisfaction.A mass
meeting was held by them in the Place de la Sorbonne.The police were in
force there to stop any disturbance, and up to 10 o'clock at night the
crowd was held in control.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

It was a warm June night, and every student in the Quarter was keyed to
a high state of excitement.Finally a great crowd of students formed in
front of the Cafe d'Harcourt, opposite the Sorbonne; things were at
fever heat; the police became rough; and in the row that ensued,
somebody hurled one of the heavy stone match-safes from a cafe table at
one of the policemen, who in his excitement picked it up and hurled it
back into the crowd.It struck and injured fatally an innocent outsider,
who was taken to the Charity Hospital, in the rue Jacob, and died there.On the following Monday another mass meeting of students was held in the
Place de la Sorbonne, who, after the meeting, formed in a body and
marched to the Chamber of Deputies, crying: "Conspuez Dupuy," who was
then president of the Chamber.A number of deputies came out on the
portico and the terrace, and smilingly reviewed the demonstration, while
the students hurled their anathemas at them, the leaders and men in the
front rank of this howling mob trying to climb over the high railing in
front of the terrace, and shouting that the police were responsible for
the death of one of their comrades.The Government, fearing further trouble and wishing to avoid any
disturbance on the day of the funeral of the victim of the riot in the
Place Sorbonne, deceived the public as to the hour when it would occur.This exasperated the students so that they began one of those
demonstrations for which Paris is famous.the next day the
Quartier Latin was in a state of siege--these poets and painters and
sculptors and musicians tore up the rue Jacob and constructed barricades
near the hospital where their comrade had died.They tore up the rue
Bonaparte, too, at the Place St.Germain des Pres, and built barricades,
composed of overturned omnibuses and tramcars and newspaper booths.They
smashed windows and everything else in sight, to get even with the
Government and the smiling deputies and the murderous police--and then
the troops came, and the affair took a different turn.In three days
thirty thousand troops were in Paris--principally cavalry, many of the
regiments coming from as far away as the center of France.[Illustration: ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS]

With these and the police and the Garde Republicaine against them, the
students melted away like a handful of snow in the sun; but the
demonstrations continued spasmodically for two or three days longer, and
the little crooked streets, like the rue du Four, were kept clear by the
cavalry trotting abreast--in and out and dodging around corners--their
black horse-tail plumes waving and helmets shining.It is sufficient to
say that the vast army of artists and poets were routed to a man and
driven back into the more peaceful atmosphere of their studios.But the "Bullier" is closing and the crowd is pouring out into the cool
air.I catch a glimpse of Yvonne with six students all in one fiacre,
but Yvonne has been given the most comfortable place.They have put her
in the hood, and the next instant they are rattling away to the Pantheon
for supper.If you walk down with the rest, you will pass dozens of jolly groups
singing and romping and dancing along down the "Boul' Miche" to the
taverne, for a bock and some ecrivisse.With youth, good humor, and a
"louis," all the world seems gay!CHAPTER IV

BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS


Of all the balls in Paris, the annual "Bal des Quat'z' Arts" stands
unique.This costume ball is given every year, in the spring, by the
students of the different ateliers, each atelier vying with the others
in creation of the various floats and corteges, and in the artistic
effect and historical correctness of the costumes.The first "Quat'z' Arts" ball was given in 1892.It was a primitive
affair, compared with the later ones, but it was a success, and
immediately the "Quat'z' Arts" Ball was put into the hands of clever
organizers, and became a studied event in all its artistic sense.Months
are spent in the creation of spectacles and in the costuming of students
and models.Prizes are given for the most successful organizations, and
a jury composed of painters and sculptors passes upon your costume as
you enter the ball, and if you do not come up to their artistic
standard you are unceremoniously turned away.Daniel went to the bathroom.Students who have been
successful in getting into the "Quat'z' Arts" for years often fail to
pass into this bewildering display of beauty and brains, owing to their
costume not possessing enough artistic originality or merit to pass the
jury.[Illustration: (coiffeur sign)]

It is, of course, a difficult matter for one who is not an enrolled
member of one of the great ateliers of painting, architecture, or
sculpture to get into the "Quat'z' Arts," and even after one's ticket is
assured, you may fail to pass the jury.Imagine this ball, with its procession of moving tableaux.A huge float
comes along, depicting the stone age and the primitive man, every detail
carefully studied from the museums.Another represents the last day of
Babylon.One sees a nude captive, her golden hair and white flesh in
contrast with the black velvet litter on which she is bound, being
carried by a dozen stalwart blackamoors, followed by camels bearing nude
slaves and the spoils of a captured city.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

As the ball continues until daylight, it resembles a bacchanalian fete
in the days of the Romans.But all through it, one is impressed by its
artistic completeness, its studied splendor, and permissible license, so
long as a costume (or the lack of it) produces an artistic result.One
sees the mise en scene of a barbaric court produced by the architects of
an atelier, all the various details constructed from carefully studied
sketches, with maybe a triumphal throne of some barbaric king, with his
slaves, the whole costumed and done in a studied magnificence that
takes one's breath away.Again an atelier of painters may reproduce the
frieze of the Parthenon in color; another a float or a decoration,
suggesting the works of their master.The room becomes a thing of splendor, for it is as gorgeous a spectacle
as the cleverest of the painters, sculptors, and architects can make it,
and is the result of careful study--and all for the love of it!--for the
great "Quat'z' Arts" ball is an event looked forward to for months.Special instructions are issued to the different ateliers while the ball
is in preparation, and the following one is a translation in part from
the notice issued before the great ball of '99.As this is a special and
private notice to the atelier, its contents may be interesting:


                                      BAL DES QUAT'Z' ARTS,
                                    Moulin Rouge, 21 April, 1899.The card of admission is absolutely personal, to be taken by the
     committee before the opening of the ball.[Illustration: (admission card)]

     The committee will be masked, and comrades without their personal
     card will be refused at the door.The cards must carry the name and
     quality of the artist, and bear the stamp of his atelier.The soldier--the dress suit,
     black or in color--the monk--the blouse--the domino--kitchen
     boy--loafer--bicyclist, and other nauseous types, are absolutely
     prohibited.Should the weather be bad, comrades are asked to wait in their
     carriages, as the committee in control cannot, under any pretext,
     neglect guarding the artistic effect of the ball during any
     confusion that might ensue.A great "feed" will take place in the grand hall; the buffet will
     serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons.The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their
     comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission
     must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their
     attendance--always insufficient.Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may
     distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their
     female display.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]

     All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on
     the grand staircase before the orchestra.The nude, as always, is
     PROHIBITED!?!The question of music at the head of the procession is of the
     greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please
     give their names to the delegates of the ateliers.Your good-will
     in this line is asked for--any great worthless capacity in this
     line will do, as they always play the same tune, "Les Pompiers!"For days before the "Quat'z' Arts" ball, all is excitement among the
students, who do as little work as possible and rest themselves for the
great event.The favorite wit of the different ateliers is given the
task of painting the banner of the atelier, which is carried at the head
of the several corteges.One of these, in Bouguereau's atelier, depicted
their master caricatured as a cupid.The boys once constructed an elephant with oriental trappings--an
elephant that could wag his ears and lift his trunk and snort--and after
the two fellows who formed respectfully the front and hind legs of this
knowing beast had practised sufficiently to proceed with him safely, at
the head of a cortege of slave girls, nautch dancers, and manacled
captives, the big beast created a success in the procession at the
"Quat'z' Arts" ball.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]

After the ball, in the gray morning light, they marched it back to the
atelier, where it remained for some weeks, finally becoming such a
nuisance, kicking around the atelier and getting in everybody's way,
that the boys agreed to give it to the first junk-man that came around.But as no junk-man came, and as no one could be found to care for its
now sadly battered hulk, its good riddance became a problem.At last the two, who had sweltered in its dusty frame that eventful
night of the "Quat'z' Arts," hit upon an idea.They marched it one day
up the Boulevard St.Germain to the Cafe des deux Magots, followed by a
crowd of people, who, when it reached the cafe, assembled around it,
every one asking what it was for--or rather what it was?--for the beast
had by now lost much of the resemblance of its former self.When half
the street became blocked with the crowd, the two wise gentlemen crawled
out of its fore and aft, and quickly mingled, unnoticed, with the
bystanders.Then they disappeared in the crowd, leaving the elephant
standing in the middle of the street.Those who had been expecting
something to happen--a circus or the rest of the parade to come
along--stood around for a while, and then the police, realizing that
they had an elephant on their hands, carted the thing away, swearing
meanwhile at the atelier and every one connected with it.The cafes near the Odeon, just before the beginning of the ball, are
filled with students in costume; gladiators hobnob at the tables with
savages in scanty attire--Roman soldiers and students, in the garb of
the ancients, strut about or chat in groups, while the uninvited
grisettes and models, who have not received invitations from the
committee, implore them for tickets.Tickets are not transferable, and should one present himself at the
entrance of the ball with another fellow's ticket, he would run small
chance of entering.The student answers, while the jury glance at his makeup.cries the jury, and you pass in to the ball.But if you are unknown they will say simply, "Connais-pas!and you pass down a long covered alley--confident, if you are a
"nouveau," that it leads into the ball-room--until you suddenly find
yourself in the street, where your ticket is torn up and all hope of
entering is gone.It is hopeless to attempt to describe the hours until morning of this
annual artistic orgy.As the morning light comes in through the
windows, it is strange to see the effect of diffused daylight,
electricity, and gas--the bluish light of early morning reflected on the
flesh tones--upon nearly three thousand girls and students in costumes
one might expect to see in a bacchanalian feast, just before the fall of
Rome.Now they form a huge circle, the front row sitting on the floor,
the second row squatting, the third seated in chairs, the fourth
standing, so that all can see the dancing that begins in the morning
hours--the wild impromptu dancing of the moment.A famous beauty, her
black hair bound in a golden fillet with a circle wrought in silver and
studded with Oriental turquoises clasping her superb torso, throws her
sandals to the crowd and begins an Oriental dance--a thing of grace and
beauty--fired with the intensity of the innate nature of this
beautifully modeled daughter of Bohemia.As the dance ends, there is a cry of delight from the great circle of
barbarians."Long live the Quat'z' Arts!"they cry, amid cheers for the
dancer.The ball closes about seven in the morning, when the long procession
forms to return to the Latin Quarter, some marching, other students and
girls in cabs and on top of them, many of the girls riding the horses.Down they come from the "Moulin Rouge," shouting, singing, and yelling.Heads are thrust out of windows, and a volley of badinage passes between
the fantastic procession and those who have heard them coming.Finally the great open court of the Louvre is reached--here a halt is
made and a general romp occurs.A girl and a type climb one of the
tall lamp-posts and prepare to do a mid-air balancing act, when
rescued by the others.At last, at the end of all this horse-play, the
march is resumed over the Pont du Carrousel and so on, cheered now by
those going to work, until the Odeon is reached.Here the odd
procession disbands; some go to their favorite cafes where the
festivities are continued--some to sleep in their costumes or what
remains of them, wherever fortune lands them--others to studios, where
the gaiety is often kept up for days.but life is not all "couleur de rose" in this true Bohemia."One day," says little Marguerite (she who lives in the rue Monge), "one
eats and the next day one doesn't.It is always like that, is it not,
monsieur?--and it costs so much to live, and so you see, monsieur, life
is always a fight."And Marguerite's brown eyes swim a little and her pretty mouth closes
firmly."I do not know, monsieur," she replies quietly; "I have not seen him in
ten days--the atelier is closed--I have been there every day, expecting
to find him--he left no word with his concierge.I have been to his cafe
too, but no one has seen him--you see, monsieur, Paul does not love me!"Mary journeyed to the bedroom.I recall an incident that I chanced to see in passing the little shop
where Marguerite works, that only confirms the truth of her realization.Paul had taken Marguerite back to the little shop, after their dejeuner
together, and, as I passed, he stopped at the door with her, kissed her
on both cheeks, and left her; but before they had gone a dozen paces,
they ran back to embrace again.This occurred four times, until Paul and
Marguerite finally parted.And, as he watched her little heels disappear
up the wooden stairs to her work-room above, Paul blew a kiss to the
pretty milliner at the window next door, and, taking a long whiff of his
cigarette, sauntered off in the direction of his atelier whistling.[Illustration: A MORNING'S WORK]

It is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but
is it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour
when she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved
with him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged
him in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours
in this poet's or painter's life so completely happy, that he looks back
on them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good
dinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among
the old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the
figure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little
Louise Dumont, who posed at Julian's, and old Jacquemart, the very soul
of good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable
humor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee
and cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often
ten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together
for others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join
them.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they
would all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff
their cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for
a light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,
placing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin
ordinaires, with a "Voila, mes enfants!"and a cheery word for all these
good boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but
dinners at Madame Giraud's for as many years as they pleased, for no one
ever thought of living out one's days, except in this good Bohemia of
Paris.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or
that La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live
with her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little
box of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,
the painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable
little spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,
full of Martin's pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and
a cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]

And those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare
Montparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table
spread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the
chicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into
which she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny
white onions!And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray
morning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these
good bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the
different ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be
asleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and
the door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and
noise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such
bohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of
good wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in
a state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that
ever lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their
good landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which
had sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,
and fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction
sale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and
everywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the
"Boul' Miche," and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their
hearts' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you
would see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over
their poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of
feeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art's sake know!The
keenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,
impractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond
to a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of
happiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good
time, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they
would make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they
knew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch
away--and have another auction![Illustration: DAYLIGHT]

Unlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically
found himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to
his lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his
English aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of
time his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,
would find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good
aunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this
impractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a
"petit bleu" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and
dine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut
Barsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as
he poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he
disturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a
topaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it
birth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as '82.It warmed the
heart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes
sparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly
and frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her
love for this "bon garcon" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for
his work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of
which this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and
he would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache
upwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his
ability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and
the fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over
their coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the
stars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and
recrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected
deep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]




CHAPTER V

"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE'S"


If you should chance to breakfast at "Lavenue's," or, as it is called,
the "Hotel de France et Bretagne," for years famous as a rendezvous of
men celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the
simplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this
restaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its
clientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]

As you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the
desk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that
desk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the
ladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,
until his name became known the world over.It has long been a
favorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the
painter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,
and dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like
Whistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other
side," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a
gorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another
room--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and
mirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with
the three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red
ribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from
the single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side
the same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the
popularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is
evident.[Illustration: RODIN]

It is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I
know in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of
intime and cosiness about Lavenue's that makes one always wish to
return.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]

You will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,
for the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and
the equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and
the newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger
children--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with
champagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,
and little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to
follow.All these you will see at Lavenue's on the "cheap side"--and the
beautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with
one of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front
room with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and
monsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of
M. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an
excellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could
never go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,
and at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its
picturesque garden----

"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little
girl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the
day--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me
whistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I
moved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool
court-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full
of chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will
hear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"
By Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]

And Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for
years, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their
tastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,
with les hommes celebres?C'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count
his decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax
enthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he
always eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is
so amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and
madame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his
work--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of
them, fresh from a hard morning's work in the studio.The tall sculptor
opposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for
the government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been
building up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,
all the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a
giantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her
existence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an
American building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a
Juno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,
her figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,
quiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will
surprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been
thrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a
smattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of
the theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and
law and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in
the cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the
French call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their
days are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and
energy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the
studio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]

The painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a
decorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,
from careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,
laying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month
later, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of
the blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,
mayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at
two, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast
liner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the
Hudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be
unrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where
its rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids
and the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will
appear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from
Ithaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and
potatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and
agree "it's grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up
his studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came
at two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des
Lilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt
terrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is
the farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just
opposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l'Observatoire.The terrace
is crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of
people along the "Boul' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only
light coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,
too, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg
Gardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very
well-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]

At the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the
concierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed
and furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this
faithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the
den of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old
swords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place
is quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day
and talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the
number of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your
court by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is
waked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court
full of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your
concierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters
who do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the
guardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of
Pere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de
menage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and
beds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at
all, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be
taken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does
not know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will
regale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,
including your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,
always concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is
quite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of
Monsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in
the rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress
with her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the
evening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or
dining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]

Alice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage
than any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was
harder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,
when barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her
name and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After
many days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de
Marcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,
with her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in
order to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a
demi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of
this--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found
employment at a baker's, where she was obliged to get up at four in the
morning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the
different houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid
her a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie
turned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering
bread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced
to meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to
relieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice
fairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty
francs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave
little Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]

"You see, monsieur, one must do one's best whatever one undertakes,"
said Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good
femme de menage, and I am 'bien contente.'No," she continued, "I shall
never marry, for one's independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,
"one's life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I
can work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,
and I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,
where, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for
bon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in
my dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the
wife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,
for he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a
charming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI

"AT MARCEL LEGAY'S"


Just off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,
you will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny
gas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where
a dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience
in the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as
the piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed
one)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,
poet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs
of Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]

From these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest
and most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they
have absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no
mincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the
trouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with
the Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique
Francaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by
them, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of
the day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of
good-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should
evince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,
who are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never
vulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility
enables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little
song with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause
that follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from
the heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay's is a
popular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little
room nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the
further end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in
clever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of
green-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the
little tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through
this anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There
is the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is
different from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller
variety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,
scarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the
cabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which
includes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the
little tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black
frock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the
solemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the
lighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his
turn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his
short, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he
rushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]

A broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is
talking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly
his turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,
he is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate
fanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has
finished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,
and then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three
handclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the
proper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it
never fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes
hurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat
upon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives
an extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny
expression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,
and then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks
serio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black
frock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet
collar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;
these, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this
every-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more
eccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round
face and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed
in a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some
pre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the
good bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval
fringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is
overwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and
girls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and
cigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador
avec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at
them to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually
subsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the
bard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and
cocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic
songs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling
and intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are
stirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he
grasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its
celestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning
for a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his
head.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres
in the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the
"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,
D'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over
in Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that
they meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who
can draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no
bread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the
boulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a
caricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a
well-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the
academies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with
portfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly
gray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too
little food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch
is strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression
that delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]

"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of
it that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the
velvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles
and jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was
all over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn
themselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,
for "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to
make trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and
fame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure
it will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains
toute le monde est triste.To have one's gaiety interrupted is regarded
as a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a
day without the pleasures of life in proportion to one's purse is
considered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay
rising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c'est gai
la-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful
country?"they will exclaim, as you
enthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm
by short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad
they will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your
disappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all
this continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to
end in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a
new sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into
automobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut
that growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it
stands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its
owner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace
over a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;
Marie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and
high boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is
working itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur
and his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace
veil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he
climbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be 'en
ballon'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no
longer mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with
the woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the
ceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight
up among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even
the memory of one's intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic
Parisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a
little chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair
and white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in
his peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush
through and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the
basket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch
blocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;
to-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we
are patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we
have courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over
the failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon
'pratique.'our dejeuner in Paris and our
dinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and
hums a little chansonette."Je t'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *

I did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the
gentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have
heard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne
du Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,
could not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a
week![Illustration: (woman)]

CHAPTER VII

"POCHARD"


Drunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these
people do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable
to a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when
drunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and
filthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices
a jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his
arms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in
front of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent
of abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own
concoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move
on to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any
attention to him.On he strides up the "Boul' Miche," past the cafes,
continuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and
confines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let
alone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

You will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with
his wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly
looking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying
to warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry
leaves shivering.The yellow glow from the
shop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant
diamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall
days make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy
cheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one's very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]

Soon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country
haunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this
Quartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy
season.Thus it was that Lachaume
and I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,
his face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy's.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S MODEL]

He stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and
leaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed
vacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small
kitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to
approach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it
patiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in
Paris.""What I'm drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued
Lachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I'm twenty years his
senior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend
leaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny
trickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]

"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he
went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conce
