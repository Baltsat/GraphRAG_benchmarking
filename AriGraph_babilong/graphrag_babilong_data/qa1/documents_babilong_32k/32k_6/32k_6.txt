Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel."Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I've a chicken ready or
some fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look
rested.He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the
dishes."I wouldn't go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr.This place is his, and he'd like a boy to come into it
when he's gone.if I did have one; what would it be?"'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath."And she--there isn't any prospect of her--?"There was no solution to Tillie's problem.Le Moyne, standing on the
hearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must
work out her own salvation.They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon.Tillie was
hungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine's wedding, of
Harriet, of Sidney in her hospital.And when he had told her all, she
sat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers.Then:--

"Take the four of us," she said suddenly,--"Christine Lorenz and Sidney
Page and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to
go wrong like this?I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would
have thought it would be the Lorenz girl.They'd have picked Harriet
Kennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have
been Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile.She looked up at K. shrewdly.They didn't know me, and I
heard them talking.They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr.As she
stood before him she looked up into his face."If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr.Le Moyne, you won't let
him get her.""I am afraid that's not up to me, is it?What would I do with a wife,
Tillie?"I guess, in the
long run, that would count more than money."That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie.He
pondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against
the wind.Wagon-tracks along the road were
filled with water and had begun to freeze.The rain had turned to a
driving sleet that cut his face.Halfway to the trolley line, the dog
turned off into a by-road.The dog stared after
him, one foot raised.Once again his eyes were like Tillie's, as she had
waved good-bye from the porch.His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,
swinging pace, and fought his battle.Was Tillie right, after all, and
had he been wrong?Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney's
unhappiness?Why not accept Wilson's offer and start over again?Then
if things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon.He
put it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did
would make no change in Sidney's ultimate decision.If she cared enough
for Wilson, she would marry him.CHAPTER XV


Palmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.
discovered Tillie.Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on
dinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine
unpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment.She
was brighter than she had been for days, more interested.The wonders of
the trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for
Sidney, who could have none of these things.In a pathetic sort of way,
she mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter.And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong.Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve.Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to
some speech of Christine's that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,
she gave her a gentle admonishing."Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear," she said."After we
have lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live
for some one else."Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging.But why should the woman do all the adjusting?""Men are more set," said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything
in her life."It is harder for them to give in.And, of course, Palmer
is older, and his habits--"

"The less said about Palmer's habits the better," flashed Christine."I
appear to have married a bunch of habits."She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while
Anna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her.Six weeks of Palmer's society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine
to distraction.She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that
seemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;
Palmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his
coffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper.And there was a darker side to the picture than that.There was a vision
of Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy
sleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink.She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he
lived.The letter she had received on
her wedding day was burned into her brain.There would be that in the
future too, probably.She was making a brave clutch
at happiness.But that afternoon of the first day at home she was
terrified.She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire.But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself.She
had determined to meet Palmer with a smile.Tears brought nothing;
she had learned that already."Daughters of joy," they called girls like the one on the Avenue.She waited while, with his back to her, he
shook himself like a great dog.He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting."It's good to be home and to see you again.Won't you come in to my
fire?""All the more reason why you should come," she cried gayly, and held the
door wide.The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with
silver vases full of flowers.K. stepped inside and took a critical
survey of the room."Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I
with the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and
your pretty self."Christine saw his approval, and was
happier than she had been for weeks.She put on the thousand little airs
and graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at
him with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on
Palmer.She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair
for him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands."And see, here's a footstool.""I am ridiculously fond of being babied," said K., and quite basked in
his new atmosphere of well-being.This was better than his empty room
upstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts."Do
tell me all the scandal of the Street.""There has been no scandal since you went away," said K. And, because
each was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this
bit of unconscious humor."Seriously," said Le Moyne, "we have been very quiet.I have had my
salary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week.Just when I had all my ideas fixed for
fifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them."It is very disagreeable when one's income becomes a burden," said
Christine gravely.She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a
solidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with
heaviness.She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide
in.She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine
profile with its strong chin.She left off her little affectations,--a
tribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching
the fire.When K. chose, he could talk well.The Howes had been to Bermuda on
their wedding trip.He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground.As for K., he frankly enjoyed
the little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair."You've been very nice to ask me in, Mrs."I hope you
will allow me to come again.But, of course, you are going to be very
gay."It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again.She did not
want him to go away.The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of
security.She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at
last he made a move toward the door.Howe I am sorry he missed our little party," said Le Moyne.As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine's
eyes.Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless.Mary moved to the bedroom.One
might still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice.When
Palmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced.The day's exertion had been bad for Anna.Le Moyne found her on the
couch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of
apprehension.She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of
aromatic ammonia beside her."Just--short of breath," she panted.Sidney--is
coming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--"

That was as far as she got.K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,
stringy, irregular.He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he
hurried into his room for amyl-nitrate.When he came back she was almost
unconscious.He broke the capsule
in a towel, and held it over her face.After a time the spasm relaxed,
but her condition remained alarming.Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her
sister's hand.Only once in the next hour or so did she speak.Harriet was too wretched to
notice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna."I've been a very hard sister to her," she said."If you can pull her
through, I'll try to make up for it."Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless.They had
sent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message
was slow in getting off.Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room."Well, this is sad, Harriet," said Dr."Why in the name of Heaven,
when I wasn't around, didn't you get another doctor.If she had had some
amyl-nitrate--"

"I gave her some nitrate of amyl," said K. quietly."There was really no
time to send for anybody.She almost went under at half-past five."Max had kept his word, and even Dr.He
gave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what
he had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work.Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in
the sick-room was at an end.She moved Christine from the stairs,
where Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to
warming her mother's bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought
order and quiet.And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her
position beside her mother.This was no time for weeping; that would
come later.Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her."I think you have known this for a long time," she said.And, when he
did not answer: "Why did you let me stay away from her?It would have
been such a little time!""We were trying to do our best for both of you," he replied.It came as a cry from the depths of the
girl's new experience."She has had so little of life," she said, over and over."After all, Sidney," he said, "the Street IS life: the world is only
many streets.She had love and content, and she
had you."Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney
and the two men knew when she went away.During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of
small unkindnesses.The thorn of Anna's inefficiency had always rankled
in her flesh.She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted.Once he thought she was fainting, and
went to her.Do you think you could get them all out of the room and
let me have her alone for just a few minutes?"He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door.And, as he
stood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street.Here in this very house were death and
separation; Harriet's starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a
long and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor.When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother's bed.He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder
like a tired child."Take me away, K.," she said pitifully.And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room.Outside of her small immediate circle Anna's death was hardly felt.Harriet carried back to her
business a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with
the small irritations of her day.Perhaps Anna's incapacity, which had
always annoyed her, had been physical.She must have had her trouble a
longtime.She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through
inefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed
their mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families.What did
they think about, these women, as they pottered about?Did they resent
the impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference
that would not see how they were failing?Hot tears fell on Harriet's
fashion-book as it lay on her knee.Not only for Anna--for Anna's
prototypes everywhere.On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of
the disaster.Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down
the next day with a low fever.Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital
again until Christmas.Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and
inquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney's reply:--

"Much better.But the days dragged on and she did not get about.Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter
gayeties.Palmer's "crowd" was a lively one.There were dinners
and dances, week-end excursions to country-houses.The Street grew
accustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all
hours of the night.Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer's car, took to
falling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent
to his mother."You never know where you are with them guys," he said briefly."We
start out for half an hour's run in the evening, and get home with the
milk-wagons.And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they
want to drive the machine.If I get a chance, I'm going to beat it while
the wind's my way."But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld's loyal heart there was no
thought of desertion.Palmer had given him a man's job, and he would
stick by it, no matter what came.There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother.There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine
and her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the
destination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when
Johnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver's seat by some drunken youth,
would hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers
as he could remember.Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few
illusions, was in danger of losing such as he had.One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the
clock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night.Palmer did
not come home at all.He sent a note from the office in the morning:

"I hope you are not worried, darling.The car broke down near the
Country Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the
night there.I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse
you.What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?"She telephoned the Country Club that morning,
and found that Palmer had not been there.But, although she knew now
that he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably
he always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew.She
shrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his
lie.But the second time it happened, she was roused.It was almost Christmas
then, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very
white, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.'s arm, and
sitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table.She was begging to be
back on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her
up soon.At three o'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a
rapping on her door.She carried a
candle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney's watch on the bedside
table."I hoped my clock was wrong," she said."I am sorry to waken you,
Sidney, but I don't know what to do."Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown."When he went out did he say--"

"He said nothing.Sidney, I am going home in the
morning.""You don't mean that, do you?""Don't I look as if I mean it?How much of this sort of thing is a woman
supposed to endure?"These things always seem terrible in the
middle of the night, but by morning--"

Christine whirled on her.You remember the letter I got on my wedding
day?""Believe it or not," said Christine doggedly, "that's exactly what has
happened.I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and
the rest I know because I know Palmer.The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to
make a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious.But
vice had remained for her a clear abstraction.There were such people,
and because one was in the world for service one cared for them.Even
the Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets.But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that
because of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked."It makes me hate all the men in the world.Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!"Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room.Mere companionship
had soothed her.She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than
Sidney."They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven," she said.My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is
another."At four o'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home.Christine met
him in the lower hall.She
confronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak."I am sorry to be so late, Chris," he said."The fact is, I am all in.I
was driving the car out Seven Mile Run.We blew out a tire and the thing
turned over."Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side.CHAPTER XVI


Young Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits
with his wedding day.In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much
in love with his wife.But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of
marriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face
value.Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed
to be.She knew him now--all his small
indolences, his affectations, his weaknesses.Later on, like other
women since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to
believe him what he was not.And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer
Howe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for
comradeship.Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he
wanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he
wanted approval.He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without
recriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was
thirsty.Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,
deep in his heart Palmer's only longing was for happiness; but this
happiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but
enjoyment.No taxi working its head
off for us.Just a little run over the country roads, eh?"It was the afternoon of the day before Christine's night visit to
Sidney.The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in
possession of a holiday."We'll go out to the Climbing Rose and have
supper.""That's not true, Grace, and you know it."The roads are frozen hard; an hour's run
into the country will bring your color back."Go and ride with your wife," said the girl,
and flung away from him.The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore
traces of her illness.She
looked curiously boyish, almost sexless.Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper
increased."You get out of here," she said suddenly."I didn't ask you to come
back.You always knew I would have to marry some day."I didn't hear any reports of you hanging
around the hospital to learn how I was getting along."Besides, one of--" He hesitated over his wife's name."A
girl I know very well was in the training-school.There would have been
the devil to pay if I'd as much as called up.""You never told me you were going to get married."Cornered, he slipped an arm around her."I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick.Anyhow, I--I hated to
tell you, honey."There was a comfortable feeling of
coming home about going there again.And, now that the worst minute of
their meeting was over, he was visibly happier.But Grace continued to
stand eyeing him somberly."I've got something to tell you," she said."Don't have a fit, and don't
laugh.If you do, I'll--I'll jump out of the window.I've got a place in
a store.She was a nice girl and he was fond of her.And he was not unselfish about it.He did not want her to belong to any one else."One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to
do at Lipton and Homburg's.I am going on for the January white sale.If
I make good they will keep me."He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement
with approval.They would have a holiday
together, and then they would say good-bye.He was getting off well, all things considered.But that isn't any
reason why we shouldn't be friends, is it?I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you
do."The mention of Sidney's name brought up in his mind Christine as he had
left her that morning.She used to be a good sport,
but she had never been the same since the day of the wedding.He thought
her attitude toward him was one of suspicion.But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence."I'll tell you what we'll do," he said."We won't go to any of the old
places.I've found a new roadhouse in the country that's respectable
enough to suit anybody.We'll go out to Schwitter's and get some dinner.And on the way out he lived up to the letter of
their agreement.The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air
of virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld's
discreet back and alert ears.The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it.He treated the
girl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt
glowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time.When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a
five-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld's not over-clean hand."I don't mind the ears," he said.And
Johnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise."There's just enough of the Jew in me," said Johnny, "to know how to
talk a lot and say nothing, Mr.He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it."I'll just give her the 'once over' now and then," he said."She'll
freeze solid if I let her stand."Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house.She had the gift of
looking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill
and her motor-coat were chic and becoming.She never overdressed, as
Christine was inclined to do.Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him.A heavy German maid
waited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in
the kitchen.Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with
visions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw
her through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated.Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling
into the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were
certain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five
dollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the
place of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It
was: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie's hiding-place interested but did not thrill
him.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she
was doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer
Howe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It
viewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its
hands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine
o'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly
stimulated."Give her the 'once over,'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl
into the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the
country roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the
throttle.He took chances
and got away with them, laughing at the girl's gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I'll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,
and the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to
go away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would
be difficult.Instead of laughing when
she drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines
that she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his
mouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood
and let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as
often they passed it.Palmer's car lost on
the hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a
coating of thin ice."I wish you'd let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we'd travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with
women, anyhow?Here was Grace as
sober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road
perhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the
result.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the
edge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood
erect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from
the boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like
figure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he
reached the car, O'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the
wreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light
he made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O'Hara's party had crawled down the bank by that
time.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay
doubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,
Grace almost shrieked with relief."I'm all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him
whiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of
pain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted
himself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII


By Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but
valiantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a
talk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by
the table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and
down the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch
in the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home
for her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to
bear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in
years."I hope you don't feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not
that we don't want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he
said simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody's kindness to--to keep things
together.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is
you.""Don't you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is
I who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived
around--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be
here than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his
eyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he
told himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever
guessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he
would be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out
that day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded
hands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now
her suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and
Palmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night
when you took care of Palmer's arm before we got Dr.I often think,
K., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do
for mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer's arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max
over it.Once at least, whenever they were
together, she brought Max into the conversation.He is
interesting, don't you think?""Very," said K.

To save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you
talk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or
when Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the
accompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,
and, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute
blankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell
you, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap
was YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He
had a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of
the shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:
"What the devil's the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his
room and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with
which he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that
last evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about
Johnny.Now that you are
such friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come
to one of his operations.Even if you didn't understand exactly, I know
it would thrill you.And--I'd like you to see me in my uniform, K. You
never have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.
very much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to
listen for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never
slammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened
the very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs
and call:--

"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper
response.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had
depended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,
too; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle
to Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight
ushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having
presented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from
the autumn's business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She
realized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the
churches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about
her.Sidney left the little house at
six, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on
duty at seven o'clock.She had been assigned to the men's surgical ward,
and went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her
mother's death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.For the
second time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney's recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her
nervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall
get on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots
had been placed."The ward is heavy, isn't it?"There are three of
us--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her
records."The probationer's name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you'd better
help her with the breakfasts.If there's any way to make a mistake, she
makes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy's features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes
looked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.
had urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered
much.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate
of a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I'm all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six
dollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows
around here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don't.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I'm no bloated
aristocrat; I don't have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to
operate on me.What a thing it was
to be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld's and make it
life again!All sorts of men made up Sidney's world: the derelicts who wandered
through the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the
unshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if
not of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but
filling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the
younger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the
other men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max
a dude, I never thought I'd lie here watching that door to see him come
in.Ain't it the hell of a world, anyhow?It
ain't much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up
with tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as
she might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled
up at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The
internes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in
their buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the
kitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting
turkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services
were held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down
elevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet
slippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor
the wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for
the occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who
drove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in
crisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a
place for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to
run out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance
call, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising
above the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass
windows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her
cap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"

"When are they going to operate?""He doesn't seem to blame you; he says it's all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer's
face showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney's shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"

"That would be cowardly, wouldn't it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn't
sulk; I think she's really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney's face.Life was terrible, after
all--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or
one was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or
like Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from
what they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and
laughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed
and wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed
to move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so
balanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There's only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld
is going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max
Wilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh
again.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them
off smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the
house."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy
started up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"

"Exactly.Unless--"

"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very
young men, and that isn't really love.""We'll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very
young.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at
the hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction
for women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don't you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven't time
to be in love.So warm did the argument become that
they passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather
heavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his
hand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,
looking ruefully after them.Ed's mind, only a vague and
inarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the
affection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing
of Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint
resentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had
taught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he
made his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o'clock that night, K. put down his pipe
and listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his
dressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his
first few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He
who had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close
touch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had
done.It had taken courage, God knew,
to give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more
courage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could
fight down this love for Sidney.The
innocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her
in his arms after her mother's death, the thousand small contacts of her
returns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter
days--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,
with Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by
Christine's fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and
watching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken
himself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when
the camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity
which would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking
out, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.'s
dresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it
lay under the pin-cushion.Two o'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the
picture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where
he could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and
looked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph
in his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them
impatiently out of his mind.Almost
before he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at
his door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,
a shawl about her shoulders."I've had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you'd
go with me.It seems as if I can't stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld's sobs had become low moans; Christine stood
helplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose
fault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine's
fingers.I guess you and I
understand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny
had been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked
strangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or
three internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a
Sidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide
and unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,
she did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to
admit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by
the door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after
all, in that condition--"

It was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he's dying; that I
murdered him."I came on duty at six o'clock and gave the
medicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all
right.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I
went to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn't give him
anything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at
the label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.'s eyes looked for a moment
directly into Carlotta's.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up
again.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had
seen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to
take her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room
at such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney's friend, that was all.It was the boy's weakened condition that was turning her
revenge into tragedy.Mary moved to the office."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without
result.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could
have forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him
with knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed
could stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld's life.For, when
staff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward
with a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven's sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at
last, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr.Sandra moved to the office."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.John went back to the bathroom.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.John went back to the garden.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.Daniel moved to the hallway.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.John went to the kitchen.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now,
