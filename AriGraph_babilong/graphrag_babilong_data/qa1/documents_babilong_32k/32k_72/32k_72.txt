Drawing quickly back into the corner, she read as follows:
"If this reaches you in time, take from the second drawer of my desk an
envelope marked 'Private Contracts' and give it to the bearer."Putting her finger to her lips, she cast a quick glance at the absorbed
figure on the veranda and stepped before the desk.She fitted the key
to the drawer and opened it rapidly but noiselessly.There lay
the envelope, and among other ticketed papers a small roll of
greenbacks--such as her father often kept there.It was HIS money; she
did not scruple to take it with the envelope.Handing the latter to
the Chinaman, who made it instantly disappear up his sleeve like a
conjurer's act, she signed him to follow her into the hall."Who gave you that note, Ah Fe?""Yes--heap Chinaman--allee same as gang.""You mean it passed from one Chinaman's hand to another?""Why didn't the first Chinaman who got it bring it here?""S'pose Mellikan man want to catchee lettel.Chinaman passee lettel nex' Chinaman."Then this package will go back the same way?""And who will YOU give it to now?""Allee same man blingee me lettel.An idea here struck Cissy which made her heart jump and her cheeks
flame.Ah Fe gazed at her with an infantile smile of admiration."Lettee me see him," said Ah Fe.Cissy handed him the missive; he examined closely some half-a-dozen
Chinese characters that were scrawled along the length of the outer
fold, and which she had innocently supposed were a part of the markings
of the rice paper on which the note was written."Heap Chinaman velly much walkee--longee way!He
pointed through the open front door to the prospect beyond.It was a
familiar one to Cissy,--the long Canada, the crest on crest of serried
pines, and beyond the dim snow-line.Ah Fe's brown finger seemed to
linger there."In the snow," she whispered, her cheek whitening like that dim line,
but her eyes sparkling like the sunshine over it."Allee same, John," said Ah Fe plaintively."Ah Fe," whispered Cissy, "take ME with you to Hop Li."Mary travelled to the hallway."No good," said Ah Fe stolidly."Hop Li, he givee this"--he indicated
the envelope in his sleeve--"to next Chinaman.S'pose you go
with me, Hop Li--you no makee nothing--allee same, makee foolee!""I know; but you just take me there."You wait here a moment," said Cissy, brightening.She had exchanged her
smart rose-sprigged chintz for a pathetic little blue-checked frock of
her school-days; the fateful hat had given way to a brown straw "flat,"
bent like a frame around her charming face.All the girlishness, and
indeed a certain honest boyishness of her nature, seemed to have come
out in her glowing, freckled cheek, brilliant, audacious eyes, and the
quick stride which brought her to Ah Fe's side."Now let's go," she said, "out the back way and down the side streets."She paused, cast a glance through the drawing-room at the contemplative
figure of the sheriff's deputy on the veranda, and then passed out of
the house forever.*****

The excitement over the failure of Montagu Trixit's bank did not burn
itself out until midnight.By that time, however, it was pretty well
known that the amount of the defalcations had been exaggerated; that
it had been preceded by the suspension of the "Excelsior Bank" of San
Francisco, of which Trixit was also a managing director, occasioned by
the discovery of the withdrawal of securities for use in the branch bank
at Canada City; that he had fled the State eastward across the Sierras;
yet that, owing to the vigilance of the police on the frontier, he had
failed to escape and was in hiding.But there were adverse reports of a
more sinister nature.It was said that others were implicated; that they
dared not bring him to justice; it was pointed out that there was more
concern among many who were not openly connected with the bank than
among its unfortunate depositors.Besides the inevitable downfall of
those who had invested their fortunes in it, there was distrust or
suspicion everywhere.Even Trixit's enemies were forced to admit the
saying that "Canada City was the bank, and the bank was Trixit."Perhaps this had something to do with an excited meeting of the
directors of the New Mill, to whose discussions Dick Masterton, the
engineer, had been hurriedly summoned.When the president told him that
he had been selected to undertake the difficult and delicate mission
of discovering the whereabouts of Montagu Trixit, and, if possible,
procuring an interview with him, he was amazed.What had the New Mill,
which had always kept itself aloof from the bank and its methods, to
do with the disgraced manager?He was still more astonished when the
president added bluntly:--

"Trixit holds securities of ours for money advanced to the mill by
himself privately.They do not appear on the books, but if he chooses
to declare them as assets of the bank, it's a bad thing for us.If he
is bold enough to keep them, he may be willing to make some arrangement
with us to carry them on.If he has got away or committed suicide, as
some say, it's for you to find the whereabouts of the securities and get
them.He is said to have been last seen near the Summit.But he was young, and there was
the thrill of adventure in this.You must take the up stage to-night.By the way, you might get some
information at Trixit's house.You--er--er--are acquainted with his
daughter, I think?""Which makes it quite impossible for me to seek her for such a purpose,"
said Masterton coldly.A few hours later he was on the coach.As they cleared the outskirts of
the town, they passed two Chinamen plodding sturdily along in the dust
of the highway.Masterton started from a slight doze in the heavy, lumbering
"mountain wagon" which had taken the place of the smart Concord coach
that he had left at the last station.The scenery, too, had changed; the
four horses threaded their way through rocky defiles of stunted larches
and hardy "brush," with here and there open patches of shrunken snow.Yet at the edge of declivities he could still see through the rolled-up
leather curtains the valley below bathed in autumn, the glistening
rivers half spent with the long summer drought, and the green <DW72>s
rolling upward into crest after crest of ascending pines.At times a
drifting haze, always imperceptible from below, veiled the view; a chill
wind blew through the vehicle, and made the steel sledge-runners that
hung beneath the wagon, ready to be shipped under the useless wheels,
an ominous provision.A few rude "stations," half blacksmith shops, half
grocery, marked the deserted but wellworn road; along, narrow "packer's"
wagon, or a tortuous file of Chinamen carrying mysterious bundles
depending from bamboo poles, was their rare and only company.The rough
sheepskin jackets which these men wore over their characteristic blue
blouses and their heavy leggings were a new revelation to Masterton,
accustomed to the thinly clad coolie of the mines."I never knew those chaps get so high up, but they seem to understand
the cold," he remarked.The driver looked up, and ejaculated his disgust and his tobacco juice
at the same moment."I reckon they're everywhar in Californy whar you want 'em and whar you
don't; you take my word for it, afore long Californy will hev to reckon
that she ginerally DON'T want 'em, ef a white man has to live here.With
a race tied up together in a language ye can't understand, ways that no
feller knows,--from their prayin' to devils, swappin' their wives, and
havin' their bones sent back to Chiny,--wot are ye goin' to do, and
where are ye?Wot are ye goin' to make outer men that look so much alike
ye can't tell 'em apart; that think alike and act alike, and never in
ways that ye kin catch on to!Fellers knotted together in some underhand
secret way o' communicatin' with each other, so that ef ye kick a
Chinaman up here on the Summit, another Chinaman will squeal in the
valley!And the way they do it just gets me!I'll tell ye
somethin' that happened, that's gospel truth!Some of the boys that
reckoned to hev some fun with the Chinee gang over at Cedar Camp started
out one afternoon to raid 'em.They groped along through the woods whar
nobody could see 'em, kalkilatin' to come down with a rush on the camp,
over two miles away.And nobody DID see 'em, only ONE Chinaman wot they
met a mile from the camp, burnin' punk to his joss or devil, and he
scooted away just in the contrary direction.Well, sir, when they
waltzed into that camp, darn my skin!ef there was a Chinaman there, or
as much as a grain of rice to grab!this
sort o' got the boys, and they set about discoverin' how it was done.One of 'em noticed that there was some of them bits of tissue paper
slips that they toss around at funerals lyin' along the road near the
camp, and another remembered that the Chinaman they met on the hill
tossed a lot of that paper in the air afore he scooted.Well, sir, the
wind carried just enough of that paper straight down the hill into
that camp ten minutes afore THEY could get there, to give them Chinamen
warnin'--whatever it was!Why, I've seen 'em stringin' along the
road just like them fellers we passed just now, and then stop all of a
suddent like hounds off the scent, jabber among themselves, and start
off in a different direction"--

"Just what they're doing now!interrupted another
passenger, who was looking through the rolled-up curtain at his side.All the passengers turned by one accord and looked out.The file of
Chinamen under observation had indeed turned, and was even then moving
rapidly away at right angles from the road.said the driver; "some yeller paper or piece
o' joss stick in the road.The remark was addressed to the passenger who had just placed his finger
on his lip, and indicated a stolid-looking Chinaman, overlooked before,
who was sitting in the back or "steerage" seat."HE is no account; he's
only the laundryman from Rocky Canyon.I'm talkin' of the coolie gang."But here the conversation flagged, and the air growing keener, the flaps
of the leather side curtains were battened down.Masterton gave himself
up to conflicting reflections.The information that he had gathered
was meagre and unsatisfactory, and he could only trust to luck and
circumstance to fulfill his mission.The first glow of adventure having
passed, he was uneasily conscious that the mission was not to his taste.John journeyed to the garden.The pretty, flushed but defiant face of Cissy that afternoon haunted
him; he had not known the immediate cause of it, but made no doubt that
she had already heard the news of her father's disgrace when he met
her.He regretted now that he hadn't spoken to her, if only a few formal
words of sympathy.He had always been half tenderly amused at her frank
conceit and her "airs,"--the innocent, undisguised pride of the country
belle, so different from the hard aplomb of the city girl!And now the
foolish little moth, dancing in the sunshine of prosperity, had felt the
chill of winter in its pretty wings.The contempt he had for the father
had hitherto shown itself in tolerant pity for the daughter, so proud
of her father's position and what it brought her.In the revelation that
his own directors had availed themselves of that father's methods, and
the ignoble character of his present mission, he felt a stirring of
self-reproach.Of course, frivolous as she
was, she would not feel the keenness of this misfortune like another,
nor yet rise superior to it.She would succumb for the present, to
revive another season in a dimmer glory elsewhere.His critical, cynical
observation of her had determined that any filial affection she
might have would be merged and lost in the greater deprivation of her
position.A sudden darkening of the landscape below, and a singular opaque
whitening of the air around them, aroused him from his thoughts.The
driver drew up the collar of his overcoat and laid his whip smartly over
the backs of his cattle.The air grew gradually darker, until suddenly
it seemed to disintegrate into invisible gritty particles that swept
through the wagon.Presently these particles became heavier, more
perceptible, and polished like small shot, and a keen wind drove them
stingingly into the faces of the passengers, or insidiously into their
pockets, collars, or the folds of their clothes.The snow forced itself
through the smallest crevice."We'll get over this when once we've passed the bend; the road seems to
dip beyond," said Masterton cheerfully from his seat beside the driver.The driver gave him a single scornful look, and turned to the passenger
who occupied the seat on the other side of him."I don't like the look
o' things down there, but ef we are stuck, we'll have to strike out for
the next station.""But," said Masterton, as the wind volleyed the sharp snow pellets in
their faces and the leaders were scarcely distinguishable through the
smoke-like discharges, "it can't be worse than here."The driver did not speak, but the other passenger craned over his back,
and said explanatorily:--

"I reckon ye don't know these storms; this kind o' dry snow don't stick
and don't clog.Indeed, between the volleys, Masterton could see that the road was
perfectly bare and wind-swept, and except slight drifts and banks beside
outlying bushes and shrubs,--which even then were again blown away
before his eyes,--the level landscape was unclothed and unchanged.Where
these mysterious snow pellets went to puzzled and confused him; they
seemed to vanish, as they had appeared, into the air about them."I'd make a straight rush for the next station," said the other
passenger confidently to the driver."If we're stuck, we're that much on
the way; if we turn back now, we'll have to take the grade anyway when
the storm's over, and neither you nor I know when THAT'll be.It may be
only a squall just now, but it's gettin' rather late in the season.Just
pitch in and drive all ye know."The driver laid his lash on the horses, and for a few moments the heavy
vehicle dashed forward in violent conflict with the storm.At times the
elastic hickory framework of its domed leather roof swayed and bent like
the ribs of an umbrella; at times it seemed as if it would be lifted
bodily off; at times the whole interior of the vehicle was filled with a
thin smoke by drifts through every cranny.But presently, to Masterton's
great relief, the interminable level seemed to end, and between the
whitened blasts he could see that the road was descending.Again the
horses were urged forward, and at last he could feel that the vehicle
began to add the momentum of its descent to its conflict with the storm.The blasts grew less violent, or became only the natural resistance of
the air to their dominant rush.With the cessation of the snow volleys
and the clearing of the atmosphere, the road became more strongly
defined as it plunged downward to a terrace on the mountain flank,
several hundred feet below.Presently they came again upon a thicker
growth of bushes, and here and there a solitary fir.The wind died away;
the cold seemed to be less bitter.Masterton, in his relief, glanced
smilingly at his companions on the box, but the driver's mouth was
compressed as he urged his team forward, and the other passenger looked
hardly less anxious.They were now upon the level terrace, and the storm
apparently spending its fury high up and behind them.But in spite of
the clearing of the air, he could not but notice that it was singularly
dark.What was more singular, the darkness seemed to have risen from
below, and to flow in upon them as they descended.A curtain of profound
obscurity, darker even than the mountain wall at their side, shut out
the horizon and the valley below.But for the temperature, Masterton
would have thought a thunderstorm was closing in upon them.An odd
feeling of uneasiness crept over him.A few fitful gusts now came from the obscurity; one of them was
accompanied by what seemed a flight of small startled birds crossing the
road ahead of them.A second larger and more sustained flight showed his
astonished eyes that they were white, and each bird an enormous flake
of SNOW!For an instant the air was filled with these disks, shreds,
patches,--two or three clinging together,--like the downfall shaken from
a tree, striking the leather roof and sides with a dull thud, spattering
the road into which they descended with large rosettes that melted away
only to be followed by hundreds more that stuck and STAYED.In five
minutes the ground was white with it, the long road gleaming out ahead
in the darkness; the roof and sides of the wagon were overlaid with it
as with a coating of plaster of Paris; the harness of the horses,
and even the reins, stood out over their steaming backs like white
trappings.In five minutes more the steaming backs themselves were
blanketed with it; the arms and legs of the outside passengers pinioned
to the seats with it, and the arms of the driver kept free only by
incessant motion.It was no longer snowing; it was "snowballing;" it
was an avalanche out of the <DW72>s of the sky.The exhausted horses
floundered in it; the clogging wheels dragged in it; the vehicle at last
plunged into a billow of it--and stopped.The bewildered and half blinded passengers hurried out into the road
to assist the driver to unship the wheels and fit the steel runners
in their axles.By the time the heavy wagon was
converted into a sledge, it was deeply imbedded in wet and clinging
snow.The narrow, long-handled shovels borrowed from the prospectors'
kits were powerless before this heavy, half liquid impediment.Sandra went to the kitchen.At last
the driver, with an oath, relinquished the attempt, and, unhitching his
horses, collected the passengers and led them forward by a narrower and
more sheltered trail toward the next stations now scarce a mile away.The led horses broke a path before them, the snow fell less heavily,
but it was nearly an hour before the straggling procession reached the
house, and the snow-coated and exhausted passengers huddled and steamed
round the red-hot stove in the bar-room.The driver had vanished with
his team into the shed; Masterton's fellow passenger on the box-seat,
after a few whispered words to the landlord, also disappeared."I see you've got Jake Poole with you," said one of the bar-room
loungers to Masterton, indicating the passenger who had just left."I
reckon he's here on the same fool business.""Jake Poole, the deputy sheriff," repeated the other."I reckon he's
here pretendin' to hunt for Montagu Trixit like the San Francisco
detectives that kem up yesterday."He had heard of Poole, but
did not know him by sight."I don't think I understand," he said coolly."I reckon you're a stranger in these parts," returned the lounger,
looking at Masterton curiously."Ef you warn't, ye'd know that about the
last man San Francisco or Canada City WANTED to ketch is Monty Trixit!But they've got to keep up a show
chase--a kind o' cirkis-ridin'--up here to satisfy the stockholders.You
bet that Jake Poole hez got his orders--they might kill him to shut his
mouth, ef they got an excuse--and he made a fight--but he ain't no such
fool.Why, the sickest man you ever saw was that director that
kem up here with a detective when he found that Monty HADN'T left the
State."The man paused, lowered his voice, and said: "I wouldn't swear he wasn't
a mile from whar we're talkin' now.Why, they do allow that he's taken a
drink at this very bar SINCE the news came!--and that thar's a hoss kept
handy in the stable already saddled just to tempt him ef he was inclined
to scoot.""That's only a bluff to start him goin' so that they kin shoot him in
his tracks," said a bystander."That ain't no good ef he has, as they SAY he has, papers stowed away
with a friend that would frighten some mighty partickler men out o'
their boots," returned the first speaker."But he's got his spies too,
and thar ain't a man that crosses the Divide as ain't spotted by them.The officers brag about havin' put a cordon around the district, and yet
they've just found out that he managed to send a telegraphic dispatch
from Black Rock station right under their noses.Why, only an hour or
so arter the detectives and the news arrived here, thar kem along one o'
them emigrant teams from Pike, and the driver said that a smart-lookin'
chap in store-clothes had come out of an old prospector's cabin up
thar on the rise about a mile away and asked for a newspaper.And the
description the teamster gave just fitted Trixit to a T. Well, the
information was give so public like that the detectives HAD to make a
rush over thar, and b'gosh!although thar wasn't a soul passed them
but a file of Chinese coolies, when they got thar they found
NOTHIN',--nothin' but them Chinamen cookin' their rice by the roadside."Masterton smiled carelessly, and walked to the window, as if intent upon
the still falling snow.But he had at once grasped the situation that
seemed now almost providential for his inexperience and his mission.The
man he was seeking was within his possible reach, if the story he had
heard was true.The detectives would not be likely to interfere with his
plans, for he was the only man who really wished to meet the fugitive.The presence of Poole made him uneasy, though he had never met the man
before.Was it barely possible that he was on the same mission on behalf
of others?IF what he heard was true, there might be others equally
involved with the absconding manager.But then the spies--how could the
deputy sheriff elude them, and how could HE?He was turning impatiently away from the window when his eye caught
sight of a straggling file of Chinamen breasting the storm on their way
up the hill.A sudden flash of intuition
made him now understand the singular way the file of coolies which
they met had diverted their course after passing the wagon.They had
recognized the deputy on the box.Stay!--there was another Chinaman in
the coach; HE might have given them the signal.He glanced hurriedly
around the room for him; he was gone.Perhaps he had already joined the
file he had just seen.His only hope was to follow them--but how?The afternoon was waning; it would be three or
four hours before the down coach would arrive, from which the driver
expected assistance.He made his way through the back door, and found himself among the straw
and chips of the stable-yard and woodshed.Still uncertain what to do,
he mechanically passed before the long shed which served as temporary
stalls for the steaming wagon horses.At the further end, to his
surprise, was a tethered mustang ready saddled and bridled--the
opportune horse left for the fugitive, according to the lounger's story.Masterton cast a quick glance around the stable; it was deserted by all
save the feeding animals.He was new to adventures of this kind, or he would probably have weighed
the possibilities and consequences.He was ordinarily a thoughtful,
reflective man, but like most men of intellect, he was also imaginative
and superstitious, and this crowning accident of the providential
situation in which he found himself was superior to his logic.There
would also be a grim irony in his taking this horse for such a purpose.He untied the rope from the bit-ring, leaped into the saddle, and
emerged cautiously from the shed.The wet snow muffled the sound of the
horse's hoofs.Moving round to the rear of the stable so as to bring it
between himself and the station, he clapped his heels into the mustang's
flanks and dashed into the open.At first he was confused and bewildered by the half hidden boulders and
snow-shrouded bushes that beset the broken ground, and dazzled by the
still driving storm.But he knew that they would also divert attention
from his flight, and beyond, he could now see a white <DW72> slowly
rising before him, near whose crest a few dark spots were crawling in
file, like Alpine climbers.He
had reasoned that when they discovered they were followed they would, in
the absence of any chance of signaling through the storm, detach one
of their number to give the alarm.He felt
his revolver safe on his hip; he would use it only if necessary to
intimidate the spies.For some moments his ascent through the wet snow was slow and difficult,
but as he advanced, he felt a change of temperature corresponding to
that he had experienced that afternoon on the wagon coming down.The air
grew keener, the snow drier and finer.He kept a sharp lookout for
the moving figures, and scanned the horizon for some indication of the
prospector's deserted hut.Suddenly the line of figures he was watching
seemed to be broken, and then gathered together as a group.Evidently they had, for, as he had expected, one of them
had been detached, and was now moving at right angles from the party
towards the right.With a thrill of excitement he urged his horse
forward; the group was far to the left, and he was nearing the solitary
figure.But to his astonishment, as he approached the top of the <DW72>
he now observed another figure, as far to the left of the group as he
was to the right, and that figure he could see, even at that distance,
was NOT a Chinaman.He halted for a better observation; for an
instant he thought it might be the fugitive himself, but as quickly he
recognized it was another man--the deputy.It was HE whom the Chinaman
had discovered; it was HE who had caused the diversion and the dispatch
of the vedette to warn the fugitive.His own figure had evidently
not yet been detected.His heart beat high with hope; he again dashed
forward after the flying messenger, who was undoubtedly seeking the
prospector's ruined hut and--Trixit.At this elevation the snow had formed a
crust, over which the single Chinaman--a lithe young figure--skimmed
like a skater, while Masterton's horse crashed though it into unexpected
depths.Again, the runner could deviate by a shorter cut, while the
horseman was condemned to the one half obliterated trail.The only thing
in Masterton's favor, however, was that he was steadily increasing his
distance from the group and the deputy sheriff, and so cutting off
their connection with the messenger.But the trail grew more and more
indistinct as it neared the summit, until at last it utterly vanished.Still he kept up his speed toward the active little figure--which now
seemed to be that of a mere boy--skimming over the frozen snow.Twice
a stumble and flounder of the mustang through the broken crust ought
to have warned him of his recklessness, but now a distinct glimpse of
a low, blackened shanty, the prospector's ruined hut, toward which
the messenger was making, made him forget all else.The distance was
lessening between them; he could see the long pigtail of the fugitive
standing out from his bent head, when suddenly his horse plunged forward
and downward.In an awful instant of suspense and twilight, such as
he might have seen in a dream, he felt himself pitched headlong into
suffocating depths, followed by a shock, the crushing weight and
steaming flank of his horse across his shoulder, utter darkness,
and--merciful unconsciousness.How long he lay there thus he never knew.With his returning
consciousness came this strange twilight again,--the twilight of a
dream.John travelled to the bathroom.He was sitting in the new church at Canada City, as he had sat
the first Sunday of his arrival there, gazing at the pretty face of
Cissy Trixit in the pew opposite him, and wondering who she was.Again
he saw the startled, awakened light that came into her adorable eyes,
the faint blush that suffused her cheek as she met his inquiring gaze,
and the conscious, half conceited, half girlish toss of her little
head as she turned her eyes away, and then a file of brown Chinamen,
muttering some harsh, uncouth gibberish, interposed between them.This
was followed by what seemed to be the crashing in of the church roof, a
stifling heat succeeded by a long, deadly chill.But he knew that
THIS last was all a dream, and he tried to struggle to his feet to see
Cissy's face again,--a reality that he felt would take him out of this
horrible trance,--and he called to her across the pew and heard her
sweet voice again in answer, and then a wave of unconsciousness once
more submerged him.He came back to life with a sharp tingling of his whole frame as if
pierced with a thousand needles.He knew he was being rubbed, and in his
attempts to throw his torturers aside, he saw faintly by the light of a
flickering fire that they were Chinamen, and he was lying on the floor
of a rude hut.With his first movements they ceased, and, wrapping him
like a mummy in warm blankets, dragged him out of the heap of loose snow
with which they had been rubbing him, toward the fire that glowed upon
the large adobe hearth.The stinging pain was succeeded by a warm glow;
a pleasant languor, which made even thought a burden, came over him, and
yet his perceptions were keenly alive to his surroundings.He heard
the Chinamen mutter something and then depart, leaving him alone.But
presently he was aware of another figure that had entered, and was now
sitting with its back to him at a rude table, roughly extemporized from
a packing-box, apparently engaged in writing.It was a small Chinaman,
evidently the one he had chased!The events of the past few hours--his
mission, his intentions, and every incident of the pursuit--flashed back
upon him.In his exhausted state he was unable to formulate a question which even
then he doubted if the Chinaman could understand.So he simply watched
him lazily, and with a certain kind of fascination, until he should
finish his writing and turn round.His long pigtail, which seemed
ridiculously disproportionate to his size,--the pigtail which he
remembered had streamed into the air in his flight,--had partly escaped
from the discovered hat under which it had been coiled.But what was
singular, it was not the wiry black pigtail of his Mongolian fellows,
but soft and silky, and as the firelight played upon it, it seemed of a
shining chestnut brown!It was like--like--he stopped--was he dreaming
again?There
was no mistaking that charming, sensitive face, glowing with health and
excitement, albeit showing here and there the mark of the pigment with
which it had been stained, now hurriedly washed off.A little of it had
run into the corners of her eyelids, and enhanced the brilliancy of her
eyes.he asked
with a faint voice, and a fainter attempt to smile."That's what I might ask about you," she said pertly, but with a slight
touch of scorn; "but I guess I know as well as I do about the others.I
came here to see my father," she added defiantly."And you are the--the--one--I chased?""Yes; and I'd have outrun you easily, even with your horse to help
you," she said proudly, "only I turned back when you went down into that
prospector's hole with your horse and his broken neck atop of you."He groaned slightly, but more from shame than pain.The young girl took
up a glass of whiskey ready on the table and brought it to him."Take
that; it will fetch you all right in a moment.he
asked hurriedly, recalling his mission."Not now; he's gone to the station--to--fetch--my clothes," she said,
with a little laugh."Yes," she replied, "to the station.Of course you don't know the news,"
she added, with an air of girlish importance."They've stopped all
proceedings against him, and he's as free as you are."Masterton tried to rise, but another groan escaped him.She knelt beside him, her soft
breath fanning his hair, and lifted him gently to a sitting position."Oh, I've done it before," she laughed, as she read his wonder, with
his gratitude, in his eyes."The horse was already stiff, and you
were nearly so, by the time I came up to you and got"--she laughed
again--"the OTHER Chinaman to help me pull you out of that hole.""I know I owe you my life," he said, his face flushing."It was lucky I was there," she returned naively; "perhaps lucky you
were chasing me.""I'm afraid that of the many who would run after you I should be the
least lucky," he said, with an attempt to laugh that did not, however,
conceal his mortification; "but I assure you that I only wished to have
an interview with your father,--a BUSINESS interview, perhaps as much in
his interest as my own."The old look of audacity came back to her face."I guess that's what
they all came here for, except one, but it didn't keep them from
believing and saying he was a thief behind his back.Yet they all wanted
his--confidence," she added bitterly.Masterton felt that his burning cheeks were confessing the truth of
this."You excepted one," he said hesitatingly.A coquettish little toss of her head added to his confusion."He threw up his job just to follow me, without my knowing it, to see
that I didn't come to any harm.He saw me only once, too, at the house
when he came to take possession.He said he thought I was 'clear grit'
to risk everything to find father, and he said he saw it in me when he
was there; that's how he guessed where I was gone when I ran away, and
followed me.""He was as right as he was lucky," said Masterton gravely.She slipped down on the floor beside him with an unconscious movement
that her masculine garments only made the more quaintly girlish, and,
clasping her knee with both hands, looked at the fire as she rocked
herself slightly backward and forward as she spoke."It will shock a proper man like you, I know," she began demurely, "but
I came ALONE, with only a Chinaman to guide me.I got these clothes from
our laundryman, so that I shouldn't attract attention.I would have got
a Chinese lady's dress, but I couldn't walk in THEIR shoes,"--she looked
down at her little feet encased in wooden sandals,--"and I had a long
way to walk.But even if I didn't look quite right to Chinamen, no white
man was able to detect the difference.You passed me twice in the stage,
and you didn't know me.I traveled night and day, most of the time
walking, and being passed along from one Chinaman to another, or, when
we were alone, being slung on a pole between two coolies like a bale of
goods.I ate what they could give me, for I dared not go into a shop or
a restaurant; I couldn't shut my eyes in their dens, so I stayed awake
all night.Yet I got ahead of you and the sheriff,--though I didn't know
at the time what YOU were after," she added presently.He was overcome with wondering admiration of her courage, and of
self-reproach at his own short-sightedness.This was the girl he had
looked upon as a spoiled village beauty, satisfied with her small
triumphs and provincial elevation, and vacant of all other purpose.Here
was she--the all-unconscious heroine--and he her critic helpless at
her feet!It was not a cheerful reflection, and yet he took a certain
delight in his expiation.Perhaps he had half believed in her without
knowing it.I regret to say he dodged the
question meanly.he said, looking
markedly at her escaped braid of hair.She followed his eyes rather than his words, half pettishly caught up
the loosened braid, swiftly coiled it around the top of her head, and,
clapping the weather-beaten and battered conical hat back again upon it,
defiantly said: "Yes!Everybody isn't as critical as you are, and even
you wouldn't be--of a Chinaman!"He had never seen her except when she was arrayed with the full
intention to affect the beholders and perfectly conscious of her
attractions; he was utterly unprepared for this complete ignoring of
adornment now, albeit he was for the first time aware how her real
prettiness made it unnecessary.She looked fully as charming in this
grotesque head-covering as she had in that paragon of fashion, the new
hat, which had excited his tolerant amusement."I'm afraid I'm a very poor critic," he said bluntly."I never conceived
that this sort of thing was at all to your taste.""I came to see my father because I wanted to," she said, with equal
bluntness."And I came to see him though I DIDN'T want to," he said, with a cynical
laugh.She turned, and fixed her brown eyes inquiringly upon him."Then you did not believe he was a thief?""It would ill become me to accuse your father or my directors," he
answered diplomatically.She was quick enough to detect the suggestion of moral superiority
in his tone, but woman enough to forgive it."You're no friend of
Windibrook," she said, "I know.""If you would like to see my popper, I can manage it," she said
hesitatingly."He'll do anything for me," she added, with a touch of her
old pride."But if he is a free
man now, and able to go where he likes, and to see whom he likes, he may
not care to give an audience to a mere messenger.""You wait and let me see him first," said the girl quickly.Then, as the
sound of sleigh-bells came from the road outside, she added, "Here he
is.I'll get your clothes; they are out here drying by the fire in
the shed."She disappeared through a back door, and returned presently
bearing his dried garments."Dress yourself while I take popper into the
shed," she said quickly, and ran out into the road.Although circulation was now
restored, and he felt a glow through his warmed clothes, he had been
sorely bruised and shaken by his fall.He had scarcely finished dressing
when Montagu Trixit entered from the shed.Masterton looked at him with
a new interest and a respect he had never felt before.There certainly
was little of the daughter in this keen-faced, resolute-lipped man,
though his brown eyes, like hers, had the same frank, steadfast
audacity.With a business brevity that was hurried but not unkindly, he
hoped Masterton had fully recovered."Thanks to your daughter, I'm all right now," said Masterton."I need
not tell you that I believe I owe my life to her energy and courage, for
I think you have experienced what she can do in that way.But YOU have
had the advantage of those who have only enjoyed her social
acquaintance in knowing all the time what she was capable of," he added
significantly."She is a good girl," said Trixit briefly, yet with a slight rise in
color on his dark, sallow cheek, and a sudden wavering of his steadfast
eyes."She tells me you have a message from your directors.I think I
know what it is, but we won't discuss it now.As I am going directly to
Sacramento, I shall not see them, but I will give you an answer to take
to them when we reach the station.I am going to give you a lift there
when my daughter is ready.It was the old Cissy that stepped into the room, dressed as she was when
she left her father's house two days before.Oddly enough, he fancied
that something of her old conscious manner had returned with her
clothes, and as he stepped with her into the back seat of the covered
sleigh in waiting, he could not help saying, "I really think I
understand you better in your other clothes."A slight blush mounted to Cissy's cheek, but her eyes were still
audacious."All the same, I don't think you'd like to walk down Main
Street with me in that rig, although you once thought nothing of taking
me over your old mill in your blue blouse and overalls."And having
apparently greatly relieved her proud little heart by this enigmatic
statement, she grew so chatty and confidential that the young man was
satisfied that he had been in love with her from the first!When they reached the station, Trixit drew him aside.Taking an envelope
marked "Private Contracts" from his pocket, he opened it and displayed
some papers.Tell your directors that you
have seen them safe in my hands, and that no one else has seen them.Tell them that if they will send me their renewed notes, dated from
to-day, to Sacramento within the next three days, I will return the
securities.But before the coach started he managed to draw
near to Cissy."You are not returning to Canada City," he said."Then I suppose I must say 'good-by.'""Popper says you are coming to
Sacramento in three days!"She returned his glance audaciously,
steadfastly."You are," she said, in her low but distinct voice.WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FONDA


PART I

"Well!"said the editor of the "Mountain Clarion," looking up
impatiently from his copy.The intruder in his sanctum was his foreman.He was also acting as
pressman, as might be seen from his shirt-sleeves spattered with ink,
rolled up over the arm that had just been working "the Archimedian lever
that moves the world," which was the editor's favorite allusion to the
hand-press that strict economy obliged the "Clarion" to use.His braces,
slipped from his shoulders during his work, were looped negligently
on either side, their functions being replaced by one hand, which
occasionally hitched up his trousers to a securer position.A pair
of down-at-heel slippers--dear to the country printer--completed his
negligee.But the editor knew that the ink-spattered arm was sinewy and ready,
that a stout and loyal heart beat under the soiled shirt, and that the
slipshod slippers did not prevent its owner's foot from being "put down"
very firmly on occasion.He accordingly met the shrewd, good-humored
blue eyes of his faithful henchman with an interrogating smile."I won't keep you long," said the foreman, glancing at the editor's copy
with his habitual half humorous toleration of that work, it being his
general conviction that news and advertisements were the only valuable
features of a newspaper; "I only wanted to talk to you a minute about
makin' suthin more o' this yer accident to Colonel Starbottle.""Well, we've a full report of it in, haven't we?"about the frequency of
these accidents, and called attention to the danger of riding those half
broken Spanish mustangs.""Yes, ye did that," said the foreman tolerantly; "but ye see, thar's
some folks around here that allow it warn't no accident.There's a heap
of them believe that no runaway hoss ever mauled the colonel ez HE got
mauled.""But I heard it from the colonel's own lips," said the editor, "and HE
surely ought to know.""He mout know and he moutn't, and if he DID know, he wouldn't tell,"
said the foreman musingly, rubbing his chin with the cleaner side of his
arm."Ye didn't see him when he was picked up, did ye?""Jake Parmlee, ez picked him up outer the ditch, says that he was half
choked, and his black silk neck-handkercher was pulled tight around his
throat.There was a mark on his nose ez ef some one had tried to gouge
out his eye, and his left ear was chawed ez ef he'd bin down in a
reg'lar rough-and-tumble clinch.""He told me his horse bolted, buck-jumped, threw him, and he lost
consciousness," said the editor positively."He had no reason for lying,
and a man like Starbottle, who carries a Derringer and is a dead shot,
would have left his mark on somebody if he'd been attacked.""That's what the boys say is just the reason why he lied.He was TOOK
SUDDENT, don't ye see,--he'd no show--and don't like to confess it.A man like HIM ain't goin' to advertise that he kin be tackled and left
senseless and no one else got hurt by it!The editor was momentarily staggered at this large truth."Who would attack Colonel Starbottle
in that fashion?He might have been shot on sight by some political
enemy with whom he had quarreled--but not BEATEN.""S'pose it warn't no political enemy?""That's jest for the press to find out and expose," returned the
foreman, with a significant glance at the editor's desk."I reckon
that's whar the 'Clarion' ought to come in.""In a matter of this kind," said the editor promptly, "the paper has no
business to interfere with a man's statement.The colonel has a perfect
right to his own secret--if there is one, which I very much doubt.But,"
he added, in laughing recognition of the half reproachful, half humorous
discontent on the foreman's face, "what dreadful theory have YOU and the
boys got about it--and what do YOU expect to expose?""Well," said the foreman very seriously, "it's jest this: You see, the
colonel is mighty sweet on that Spanish woman Ramierez up on the hill
yonder.It was her mustang he was ridin' when the row happened near her
house."said the editor, with disconcerting placidity."Well,"--hesitated the foreman, "you see, they're a bad lot, those
Greasers, especially the Ramierez, her husband."The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial
prejudice against this race, which he himself had always combated.Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estate,--the last of many
leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee, his landlord,--and had a
wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms.Gambling took place
at the fonda, and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican
did not, however, prevent the American from trying to win his money."Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel?But in that case he
would have knifed him,--Spanish fashion,--and not without a struggle.""There's more ways they have o' killin' a man than that; he might hev
been dragged off his horse by a lasso and choked," said the foreman
darkly.The editor had heard of this vaquero method of putting an enemy hors
de combat; but it was a clumsy performance for the public road, and the
brutality of its manner would have justified the colonel in exposing it.The foreman saw the incredulity expressed in his face, and said somewhat
aggressively, "Of course I know ye don't take no stock in what's said
agin the Greasers, and that's what the boys know, and what they said,
and that's the reason why I thought I oughter tell ye, so that ye
mightn't seem to be always favorin' 'em."The editor's face darkened slightly, but he kept his temper and his
good humor."So that to prove that the 'Clarion' is unbiased where the
Mexicans are concerned, I ought to make it their only accuser, and cast
a doubt on the American's veracity?""I don't mean that," said the foreman, reddening."Only I thought ye
might--as ye understand these folks' ways--ye might be able to get at
them easy, and mebbe make some copy outer the blamed thing.It would
just make a stir here, and be a big boom for the 'Clarion.'""I've no doubt it would," said the editor dryly."However, I'll make
some inquiries; but you might as well let 'the boys' know that the
'Clarion' will not publish the colonel's secret without his permission.Meanwhile," he continued, smiling, "if you are very anxious to add
the functions of a reporter to your other duties and bring me any
discoveries you may make, I'll--look over your copy."He good humoredly nodded, and took up his pen again,--a hint at which
the embarrassed foreman, under cover of hitching up his trousers,
awkwardly and reluctantly withdrew.It was with some natural youthful curiosity, but no lack of loyalty to
Colonel Starbottle, that the editor that evening sought this "war-horse
of the Democracy," as he was familiarly known, in his invalid chamber at
the Palmetto Hotel.He found the hero with a bandaged ear and--perhaps
it was fancy suggested by the story of the choking--cheeks more than
usually suffused and apoplectic.Nevertheless, he was seated by the
table with a mint julep before him, and welcomed the editor by instantly
ordering another.The editor was glad to find him so much better."Gad, sir, no bones broken, but a good deal of 'possum scratching about
the head for such a little throw like that.I must have slid a yard or
two on my left ear before I brought up.""You were unconscious from the fall, I believe.""Only for an instant, sir--a single instant!I recovered myself with the
assistance of a No'the'n gentleman--a Mr."Then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall?"The colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips, and set it
down."You say you were unconscious," returned the editor lightly, "and some
of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to
be the cause.They are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of
some foul play."Do you take me for a chuckle-headed niggah, that I
don't know when I'm thrown from a buck-jumping mustang?or do they think
I'm a Chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies?Do
they know, sir, that the account I have given I am responsible for,
sir?--personally responsible?"There was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious,
and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a
secret.A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in
defense."They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly
disposed person during your unconsciousness," explained the editor
diplomatically; "but as you say THAT was only for a moment, and that you
were aware of everything that happened"--He paused.As plain as I see this julep before me.I
had just left the Ramierez rancho.The senora,--a devilish pretty
woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me
her daughter's mustang if I could ride it home."I'm an older man than you, sir, but a
challenge from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet
old enough to decline.Gad, sir, I mounted the brute.I've ridden Morgan
stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback, sir, but I've never thrown
my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before.After he bolted I
held my own fairly, but he buck-jumped before I could lock my spurs
under him, and the second jump landed me!""How far from the Ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown?""A matter of four or five hundred yards, sir.""Then your accident might have been seen from the fonda?"For in that case, I may say, without vanity,
that--er--the--er senora would have come to my assistance."The old-fashioned shirt-frill which the colonel habitually wore grew
erectile with a swelling indignation, possibly half assumed to conceal a
certain conscious satisfaction beneath.Grey," he said, with pained
severity, "as a personal friend of mine, and a representative of the
press,--a power which I respect,--I overlook a disparaging reflection
upon a lady, which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and
thoughtlessness.At the same time, sir," he added, with illogical
sequence, "if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions, he knew where
I could be found, sir, and that it was not my habit to decline
giving gentlemen--of any nationality--satisfaction--sir!--personal
satisfaction."He paused, and then added, with a singular blending of anxiety and a
certain natural dignity, "I trust, sir, that nothing of this--er--kind
will appear in your paper.""It was to keep it out by learning the truth from you, my dear colonel,"
said the editor lightly, "that I called to-day.Why, it was even
suggested," he added, with a laugh, "that you were half strangled by a
lasso."To his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh, but brought his
hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed
face."I admit, sir," he said, with a forced smile, "that I experienced
a certain sensation of choking, and I may have mentioned it to Mr.Parmlee; but it was due, I believe, sir, to my cravat, which I always
wear loosely, as you perceive, becoming twisted in my fall, and in
rolling over."He extended his fat white hand to the editor, who shook it cordially,
and then withdrew.Nevertheless, although perfectly satisfied with his
mission, and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the
subject, Mr.What were the
relations of the colonel with the Ramierez family?From what he himself
had said, the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack
might have been possible, and the assault itself committed while the
colonel was unconscious.Grey, however, kept this to himself, briefly told his foreman that
he found no reason to add to the account already in type, and dismissed
the subject from his mind.One morning a week afterward, the foreman entered the sanctum
cautiously, and, closing the door of the composing-room behind him,
stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of
irresolution, shamefacedness, and humorous discomfiture in his face.Answering the editor's look of inquiry, he began slowly, "Mebbe ye
remember when we was talkin' last week o' Colonel Starbottle's accident,
I sorter allowed that he knew all the time WHY he was attacked that way,
only he wouldn't tell.""Yes, I remember you were incredulous," said the editor, smiling."Well, I have been through the mill myself!"He unbuttoned his shirt collar, pointed to his neck, which showed a
slight abrasion and a small livid mark of strangulation at the throat,
and added, with a grim smile, "And I've got about as much proof as I
want."The editor put down his pen and stared at him.When you bedeviled me
about gettin' that news, and allowed I might try my hand at reportin',
I was fool enough to take up the challenge.So once or twice, when I was
off duty here, I hung around the Ramierez shanty.Once I went in thar
when they were gamblin'; thar war one or two Americans thar that war
winnin' as far as I could see, and was pretty full o' that aguardiente
that they sell thar--that kills at forty rods.You see, I had a kind o'
suspicion that ef thar was any foul play goin' on it might be worked
on these fellers ARTER they were drunk, and war goin' home with thar
winnin's.""So you gave up your theory of the colonel being attacked from
jealousy?"I only reckoned that ef thar was a gang
of roughs kept thar on the premises they might be used for that purpose,
and I only wanted to ketch em at thar work.So I jest meandered into the
road when they war about comin' out, and kept my eye skinned for what
might happen.Thar was a kind o' corral about a hundred yards down the
road, half adobe wall, and a stockade o' palm's on top of it, about six
feet high.Some of the palm's were off, and I peeped through, but thar
warn't nobody thar.I stood thar, alongside the bank, leanin' my back
agin one o' them openin's, and jest watched and waited."All of a suddent I felt myself grabbed by my coat collar behind, and my
neck-handkercher and collar drawn tight around my throat till I couldn't
breathe.The more I twisted round, the tighter the clinch seemed to get.I couldn't holler nor speak, but thar I stood with my mouth open, pinned
back agin that cursed stockade, and my arms and legs movin' up and down,
like one o' them dancin' jacks!Grey--I reckon I
looked like a darned fool--but I don't wanter feel ag'in as I did jest
then.The clinch o' my throat got tighter; everything got black about
me; I was jest goin' off and kalkilatin' it was about time for you to
advertise for another foreman, when suthin broke--fetched away!"It was my collar button, and I dropped like a shot.Daniel went to the office.It was a minute
before I could get my breath ag'in, and when I did and managed to climb
that darned stockade, and drop on the other side, thar warn't a soul to
be seen!A few hosses that stampeded in my gettin' over the fence war
all that was there!I was mighty shook up, you bet!--and to make the
hull thing perfectly ridic'lous, when I got back to the road, after all
I'd got through, darn my skin, ef thar warn't that pesky lot o' drunken
men staggerin' along, jinglin' the scads they had won, and enjoyin'
themselves, and nobody a-followin' 'em!I jined 'em jest for kempany's
sake, till we got back to town, but nothin' happened.""But, my dear Richards," said the editor warmly, "this is no longer a
matter of mere reporting, but of business for the police.You must see
the deputy sheriff at once, and bring your complaint--or shall I?"I've told this to nobody
but you--nor am I goin' to--sabe?It's an affair of my own--and I reckon
I kin take care of it without goin' to the Revised Statutes of the State
of California, or callin' out the sheriff's posse."His humorous blue eyes just then had certain steely points in them like
glittering facets as he turned them away, which the editor had
seen before on momentous occasions, and he was speaking slowly and
composedly, which the editor also knew boded no good to an adversary."Don't be a fool, Richards," he said quietly."Don't take as a personal
affront what was a common, vulgar crime.You would undoubtedly have been
robbed by that rascal had not the others come along.""I might hev bin robbed a dozen times afore
THEY came along--ef that was the little game.Grey,--it warn't
no robbery.""Had you been paying court to the Senora Ramierez, like Colonel
Starbottle?""Not much," returned Richards scornfully; "she ain't my style.But"--he
hesitated, and then added, "thar was a mighty purty gal thar--and her
darter, I reckon--a reg'lar pink fairy!She kem in only a minute, and
they sorter hustled her out ag'in--for darn my skin ef she didn't look
as much out o' place in that smoky old garlic-smellin' room as an angel
at a bull-fight.And what got me--she was ez white ez you or me, with
blue eyes, and a lot o' dark reddish hair in a long braid down her back.Why, only for her purty sing-song voice and her 'Gracias, senor,'
you'd hev reckoned she was a Blue Grass girl jest fresh from across the
plains."A little amused at his foreman's enthusiasm, Mr.Grey gave an
ostentatious whistle and said, "Come, now, Richards, look here!"Only a little girl--a mere child, Mr.Grey--not more'n fourteen if a
day," responded Richards, in embarrassed depreciation."Yes, but those people marry at twelve," said the editor, with a
laugh.Your appreciation may have been noticed by some other
admirer."He half regretted this speech the next moment in the quick flush--the
male instinct of rivalry--that brought back the glitter of Richards's
eyes."I reckon I kin take care of that, sir," he said slowly, "and I
kalkilate that the next time I meet that chap--whoever he may be--he
won't see so much of my back as he did."The editor knew there was little doubt of this, and for an instant
believed it his duty to put the matter in the hands of the police.Richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a bar-room fight.But reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to
avoid, he concluded to make some personal investigation.A stronger
curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him.It was singular,
too, that Richards's description of the girl was that of a different and
superior type--the hidalgo, or fair-skinned Spanish settler.If this
was true, what was she doing there--and what were her relations to the
Ramierez?PART II

The next afternoon he went to the fonda.Situated on the outskirts of
the town which had long outgrown it, it still bore traces of its former
importance as a hacienda, or smaller farm, of one of the old Spanish
landholders.The patio, or central courtyard, still existed as a
stable-yard for carts, and even one or two horses were tethered to the
railings of the inner corridor, which now served as an open veranda to
the fonda or inn.The opposite wing was utilized as a tienda, or
general shop,--a magazine for such goods as were used by the Mexican
inhabitants,--and belonged also to Ramierez.Ramierez himself--round-whiskered and Sancho Panza-like in
build--welcomed the editor with fat, perfunctory urbanity.The fonda and
all it contained was at his disposicion.The senora coquettishly bewailed, in rising and falling inflections, his
long absence, his infidelity and general perfidiousness.Truly he was
growing great in writing of the affairs of his nation--he could no
longer see his humble friends!Yet not long ago--truly that very
week--there was the head impresor of Don Pancho's imprenta himself who
had been there!A great man, of a certainty, and they must take what they could get!They were only poor innkeepers; when the governor came not they must
welcome the alcalde.To which the editor--otherwise Don Pancho--replied
with equal effusion.He had indeed recommended the fonda to his
impresor, who was but a courier before him.The
impresor had been ravished at the sight of a beautiful girl--a mere
muchacha--yet of a beauty that deprived the senses--this angel--clearly
the daughter of his friend!Here was the old miracle of the orange in
full fruition and the lovely fragrant blossom all on the same tree--at
the fonda."Yes, it was but a thing of yesterday," said the senora, obviously
pleased."The muchacha--for she was but that--had just returned from the
convent at San Jose, where she had been for four years.The fonda was no place for the child, who should know only the
litany of the Virgin--and they had kept her there.And now--that she
was home again--she cared only for the horse.There might be a festival--all the same to
her, it made nothing if she had the horse to ride!Even now she was with
one in the fields.Would Don Pancho attend and see Cota and her horse?"The editor smilingly assented, and accompanied his hostess along the
corridor to a few steps which brought them to the level of the open
meadows of the old farm inclosure.A slight white figure on horseback
was careering in the distance.At a signal from Senora Ramierez it
wheeled and came down rapidly towards them.But when within a hundred
yards the horse was suddenly pulled up vaquero fashion, and the little
figure leaped off and advanced toward them on foot, leading the horse.Grey saw that she had been riding bareback, and
from her discreet halt at that distance he half suspected ASTRIDE!His
effusive compliments to the mother on this exhibition of skill were
sincere, for he was struck by the girl's fearlessness.But when
both horse and rider at last stood before him, he was speechless and
embarrassed.For Richards had not exaggerated the girl's charms.She was indeed
dangerously pretty, from her tawny little head to her small feet,
and her figure, although comparatively diminutive, was perfectly
proportioned.Gray eyed and blonde as she was in color, her racial
peculiarities were distinct, and only the good-humored and enthusiastic
Richards could have likened her to an American girl.But he was the more astonished in noticing that her mustang was as
distinct and peculiar as herself--a mongrel mare of the extraordinary
type known as a "pinto," or "calico" horse, mottled in lavender and
pink, Arabian in proportions, and half broken!Her greenish gray eyes,
in which too much of the white was visible, had, he fancied, a singular
similarity of expression to Cota's own!Utterly confounded, and staring at the girl in her white, many flounced
frock, bare head, and tawny braids, as she stood beside this incarnation
of equine barbarism, Grey could remember nothing like it outside of a
circus.He stammered a few words of admiration of the mare.Miss Cota threw out
her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey, and said--

"A la disposicion de le Usted, senor."Grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this
formal curtsey and danced in the girl's eyes, and even fancied it shared
by the animal itself.But he was a singularly good rider of untrained
stock, and rather proud of his prowess."I accept that I may have the honor of laying the senorita's gift again
at her little feet."But here the burly Ramierez intervened.May the
devil fly away with all this nonsense!I will have no more of it," he
said impatiently to the girl."Have a care, Don Pancho," he turned to
the editor; "it is a trick!""One I think I know," said Grey sapiently.The girl looked at him
curiously as he managed to edge between her and the mustang, under the
pretense of stroking its glossy neck."I shall keep MY OWN spurs,"
he said to her in a lower voice, pointing to the sharp, small-roweled
American spurs he wore, instead of the large, blunt, five-pointed star
of the Mexican pattern.The girl evidently did not understand him then--though she did a moment
later!For without attempting to catch hold of the mustang's mane, Grey
in a single leap threw himself across its back.The animal, utterly
unprepared, was at first stupefied.But by this time her rider had his
seat.He felt her sensitive spine arch like a cat's beneath him as she
sprang rocket-wise into the air.Instead of clinging tightly to her flanks
with the inner side of his calves, after the old vaquero fashion to
which she was accustomed, he dropped his spurred heels into her sides
and allowed his body to rise with her spring, and the cruel spur to cut
its track upward from her belly almost to her back.She dropped like a shot, he dexterously withdrawing his spurs, and
regaining his seat, jarred but not discomfited.Again she essayed a
leap; the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her
smooth barrel.She tried a third leap, but this time dropped halfway as
she felt the steel scraping her side, and then stood still, trembling.There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife, assisted
by a lounging vaquero in the corridor.Ashamed of his victory, Grey
turned apologetically to Cota.To his surprise she glanced indifferently
at the trickling sides of her favorite, and only regarded him curiously."Ah," she said, drawing in her breath, "you are strong--and you
comprehend!""It was only a trick for a trick, senorita," he replied, reddening;
"let me look after those scratches in the stable," he added, as she was
turning away, leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in
the rear.He would have taken the riata which she was still holding, but she
motioned him to precede her.He did so by a few feet, but he had
scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly
by the shoulders, and, shoving him into the entrance, slammed the door
upon him.Amazed and a little indignant, he turned in time to hear a slight sound
of scuffling outside, and to see Cota re-enter with a flushed face."Pardon, senor," she said quickly, "but I feared she might have kicked
you.Rest tranquil, however, for the servant he has taken her away."She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily
driving the mustang toward the corral.I almost threw you, too;
but," she added, with a dazzling smile, "you must not punish me as you
have her!For you are very strong--and you comprehend."But Grey did not comprehend, and with a few hurried apologies he managed
to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor.Besides, this unlooked-for
incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his
visit,--the discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel
Starbottle.His inquiries of the Ramierez produced no result.Senor Ramierez was not
aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda,
and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free
of disturbance.the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was
dangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even
of Cota!Grey was fain to ride home empty of information.He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly
one afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the
composing-room.She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to
view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would
not be likely to "disturb Mr.But the beaming face of
Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed
the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted
splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for
the occasion.Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt.Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish
curiosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press,
or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his
"composing-stick."He had even printed a card with her name, "Senorita
Cota Ramierez," the type of which had been set up, to the accompaniment
of ripples of musical laughter, by her little brown fingers.The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not
noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly
on himself, even while apparently listening to Richards, were more than
ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had
wandered so coldly.He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foreman's innocent
tete-a-tete, but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the
highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop, and blew him an audacious
kiss from the tips of her fingers.For several days afterwards Richards's manner was tinged with a certain
reserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the
delicacy of a serious affection, but he was surprised also to find that
his foreman's eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat
abated.Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped, and the
editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened
by a chance incident.An intimate friend and old companion of his--one Enriquez Saltillo--had
diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him.Enriquez
was a scion of one of the oldest Spanish-California families, and in
addition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect
an intense admiration of American ways and habits, and even to combine
the current California slang with his native precision of speech--and a
certain ironical levity still more his own.It seemed, therefore, quite natural to Mr.Grey to find him seated with
his feet on the editorial desk, his hat cocked on the back of his head,
reading the "Clarion" exchanges.But he was up in a moment, and had
embraced Grey with characteristic effusion."I find myself, my leetle brother, but an hour ago two leagues from this
spot!It is the home of Don Pancho--my friend!I shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader, collecting
the subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry, or gouging
out the eye of the rival editor, at which I shall assist!'I hesitate no
longer; I fly on the instant, and I am here."Saltillo knew the Spanish population thoroughly--his
own superior race and their Mexican and Indian allies.If any one could
solve the mystery of the Ramierez fonda, and discover Richards's unknown
assailant, it was HE!But Grey contented himself, at first, with a
few brief inquiries concerning the beautiful Cota and her anonymous
association with the Ramierez."Of your suspicions, my leetle brother, you are right--on the half!That
leetle angel of a Cota is, without doubt, the daughter of the adorable
Senora Ramierez, but not of the admirable senor--her husband.We are a simple, patriarchal race; thees Ramierez, he was the
Mexican tenant of the old Spanish landlord--such as my father--and we
are ever the fathers of the poor, and sometimes of their children.It
is possible, therefore, that the exquisite Cota resemble the Spanish
landlord.I remember," he went on, suddenly
striking his forehead with a dramatic gesture, "the old owner of thees
ranch was my cousin Tiburcio.Of a consequence, my friend, thees angel
is my second cousin!I shall
embrace my long-lost relation.I shall introduce my best friend, Don
Pancho, who lofe her.I shall say, 'Bless you, my children,' and it is
feenish!He started up and clapped on his hat, but Grey caught him by the arm."For Heaven's sake, Enriquez, be serious for once," he said, forcing him
back into the chair.The foreman in the other
room is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl.In fact, it is on his
account that I am making these inquiries.""Ah, the gentleman of the pantuflos, whose trousers will not remain!Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive
from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash.But," in
recognition of Grey's half serious impatience, "remain tranquil.The friend of my friend is ever the
same as my friend!He is truly not seducing to the eye, but without
doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time.I shall gif
to him my second cousin.He attempted to rise, but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey."I've half a mind to let you do it, and get chucked through the window
for your pains," said the editor, with a half laugh.This
is a more serious matter than you suppose."And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on
Starbottle and Richards.As he proceeded he noticed, however, that
the ironical light died out of Enriquez's eyes, and a singular
thoughtfulness, yet unlike his usual precise gravity, came over his
face.He twirled the ends of his penciled mustache--an unfailing sign of
Enriquez's emotion."The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as
the gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that
it come from Ramierez, though they both were at the fonda," he said
gravely."The cause of it have not come to-day, nor yesterday, nor
last week.The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant
Starbottle or excellent Richards; before there was any American in
California--before you and I, my leetle brother, have lif!The cause
happen first--TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!"The editor's start of impatient incredulity was checked by the
unmistakable sincerity of Enriquez's face."It is so," he went on
gravely; "it is an old story--it is a long story.I shall make him
short--and new."He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression."It was when the padres first have the mission, and take the heathen and
convert him--and save his soul.It was their business, you comprehend,
my Pancho?The more heathen they convert, the more soul they save, the
better business for their mission shop.But the heathen do not always
wish to be 'convert;' the heathen fly, the heathen skidaddle, the
heathen will not remain, or will backslide.So the
holy fathers make a little game.You do not of a possibility comprehend
how the holy fathers make a convert, my leetle brother?"They take from the presidio five or six
dragons--you comprehend--the cavalry soldiers, and they pursue the
heathen from his little hut.When they cannot surround him and he fly,
they catch him with the lasso, like the wild hoss.The lasso catch
him around the neck; he is obliged to remain.Sometime he is dead, but the soul is save!I
see you wrinkle the brow--you flash the eye; you like it not?Believe
me, I like it not, neither, but it is so!"He shrugged his shoulders, threw away his half smoked cigarette, and
went on."One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul,
when he find the heathen, who is a young girl, have escape the soldiers,
he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it!He is lucky; he catch
her--but look you!She not only fly, but of
a surety she drag the good padre with her!He cannot loose himself, for
his riata is fast to the saddle; the dragons cannot help, for he is drag
so fast.On the instant she have gone--and so have the padre.It is not a young girl he have lasso, but the devil!You comprehend--it
is a punishment--a retribution--he is feenish!"For every year he must come back a spirit--on a spirit hoss--and swing
the lasso, and make as if to catch the heathen.He is condemn ever to
play his little game; now there is no heathen more to convert, he catch
what he can.My grandfather have once seen him--it is night and a storm,
and he pass by like a flash!My grandfather like it not--he is much
dissatisfied!My uncle have seen him, too, but he make the sign of
the cross, and the lasso have fall to the side, and my uncle have much
gratification.A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both
been picked up, lassoed, and dragged dead."Many peoples have died of him in the strangling.Sometime he is seen,
sometime it is the woman only that one sees--sometime it is but the
hoss.Of a truth, my friend, the
gallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped!"There was not the slightest
suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner; nothing, indeed,
but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament.It struck
him also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang
which was always a part of his imitative levity."Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known?"It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story."With it he seemed to have put on his old
levity."Come, behold, it is a long time between drinks!Let us to the
hotel and the barkeep, who shall give up the smash of brandy and the
julep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the
swallow!Grey returned to the "Clarion" office in a much more satisfied
condition of mind.Whatever faith he held in Enriquez's sincerity, for
the first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had
found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident.The
legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital
"copy."No names would be mentioned, yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized
his own adventure, he could not possibly object to this interpretation
of it.The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of
a ghost story, or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation.Nor
could Richards find fault with this view of his own experience, hitherto
kept a secret, so long as it did not refer to his relations with the
fair Cota.Summoning him at once to his sanctum, he briefly repeated the
story he had just heard, and his purpose of using it.To his surprise,
Richards's face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquez's
own.Grey," he said awkwardly, "and I ain't sayin'
it ain't mighty good newspaper stuff, but it won't do NOW, for the whole
mystery's up and the assailant found.""I didn't reckon ye were so keen on it," said Richards embarrassedly,
"and--and--it wasn't my own secret altogether.""Go on," said the editor impatiently."Well," said Richards slowly and doggedly, "ye see there was a fool that
was sweet on Cota, and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride
her cursed pink and yaller mustang.Naturally the beast bolted at once,
but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so, when it
took to buck-jumpin'.The first 'buck' threw him clean into the road,
but didn't stun him, yet when he tried to rise, the first thing he
knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody.He was
held so tight that he couldn't turn, but he managed to get out his
revolver and fire two shots under his arm.The grip held on for a
minute, and then loosened, and the somethin' slumped down on top o' him,
but he managed to work himself around.And then--what do you think he
saw?--why, that thar hoss!with two bullet holes in his neck, lyin'
beside him, but still grippin' his coat collar and neck-handkercher in
his teeth!the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle, the
villain that took me behind when I was leanin' agin that cursed fence,
was that same God-forsaken, hell-invented pinto hoss!"In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience, and
the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda.Undoubtedly
Cota had saved him from a similar attack."But why not tell this story with the other?"said the editor, returning
to his first idea."It won't do," said Richards, with dogged resolution."Yes," said Richards, with a darkening face."Again attacked, and by the
same hoss!Whether Cota was or was not knowin' its tricks,
she was actually furious at me for killin' it--and it's all over 'twixt
me and her.""Nonsense," said the editor impulsively; "she will forgive you!You
didn't know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED.Look at the
attack on you in the road!"Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness.I oughter guessed it was a hoss then--thar was nothin' else in
that corral.Cota's already gone away back to San Jose, and I reckon
the Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off.So, on account
of its bein' HER hoss, and what happened betwixt me and her, you see my
mouth is shut.""And the columns of the 'Clarion' too," said the editor, with a sigh."I know it's hard, sir, but it's better so.I've reckoned mebbe she was
a little crazy, and since you've told me that Spanish yarn, it mout
be that she was sort o' playin' she was that priest, and trained that
mustang ez she did."After a pause, something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as
he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders."Yes, sir, I was a fool, for we've lost the only bit of real sensation
news that ever came in the way of the 'Clarion.'"A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS


It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and the hottest hour of the day
on that Sierran foothill.The western sun, streaming down the mile-long
<DW72> of close-set pine crests, had been caught on an outlying ledge of
glaring white quartz, covered with mining tools and debris, and
seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage.The air above it
shimmered and became visible.A white canvas tent on it was an object
not to be borne; the steel-tipped picks and shovels, intolerable to
touch and eyesight, and a tilted tin prospecting pan, falling over,
flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence.At such moments
the five members of the "Eureka Mining Company" prudently withdrew to
the nearest pine-tree, which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the
glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that
line cut like a knife.The men lay, or squatted, in this shadow,
feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond
the burning ledge.Yet so irritating was the dry air, fragrant with the
aroma of the heated pines, that occasionally one would start up and walk
about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave
a momentary relief, and, as he believed, saved him from sunstroke.Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously:--

"Derned if the blasted bucket ain't empty ag'in!Not a drop left, by
Jimminy!"A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted
heads; then every man lay down again, as if trying to erase himself."I did," said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably
on his back, "and if anybody reckons I'm going to face Tophet ag'in
down that <DW72>, he's mistaken!"The speaker was thirsty--but he had
principles."We must throw round for it," said the foreman, taking the dice from his
pocket.He cast; the lowest number fell to Parkhurst, a florid, full-blooded
Texan."All right, gentlemen," he said, wiping his forehead, and lifting
the tin pail with a resigned air, "only EF anything comes to me on that
bare stretch o' stage road,--and I'm kinder seein' things spotty and
black now, remember you ain't anywhar NEARER the water than you were!I
ain't sayin' it for myself--but it mout be rough on YOU--and"--

"Give ME the pail," interrupted a tall young fellow, rising.Cries of "Good old Ned," and "Hunky boy!"greeted him as he took the
pail from the perspiring Parkhurst, who at once lay down again."You
mayn't be a professin' Christian, in good standin', Ned Bray," continued
Parkhurst from the ground, "but you're about as white as they make 'em,
and you're goin' to do a Heavenly Act!I repeat it, gents--a Heavenly
Act!"Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail, stopping only in the
underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put
within the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around
the outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders.Thus
equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail
which began to descend towards the stage road.Here he was in the
full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which
scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash.The descent was
steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine
needles that had fallen from above.Nor were his troubles over when,
a few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in
a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by
heavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so
heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the
foot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it.Yet there were
two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach
that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped
diagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he
was seeking.When he reached the trail, he paused to take breath and wipe the
blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung
himself over the bank into it.A single misstep here would have sent him
headlong to the tops of pine-trees a thousand feet below.Holding his
pail in one hand, with the other he steadied himself by clutching the
ferns and brambles at his side, and at last reached the spring--a niche
in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide.He had merely
accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the
Eureka Company four or five times a day!He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear,
cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin; he threw the water over
his head and shoulders; he swung his legs over the ledge and let the
overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles.Gentle and delicious rigors
came over him.He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark
olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain.A hawk
was swinging lazily above it, apparently within a stone's throw of him;
he knew it was at least a mile away.Thirty feet above him ran the stage
road; he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs, the dull
jar of harness, and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it
crawled up the long ascent, part of which he had just passed.He thought
of it,--a slow drifting cloud of dust and heat, as he had often seen
it, abandoned by even its passengers, who sought shelter in the wayside
pines as they toiled behind it to the summit,--and hugged himself in
the grateful shadows of the spring.It had passed out of hearing and
thought, he had turned to fill his pail, when he was startled by a
shower of dust and gravel from the road above, and the next moment he
was thrown violently down, blinded and pinned against the ledge by the
fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders.His last flash of
consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped
from the pack of some passing mule.It was probably
not long, for his chilled hands and arms, thrust by the blow on his
shoulders into the pool of water, assisted in restoring him.He came
to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back, but his head and
shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft
fabrics and draperies, which, to his connecting consciousness, seemed as
if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack.With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the
pool, and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings.In
doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesh--a soft, bared arm!With
the same astounding discovery came one more terrible: that arm belonged
to the weight that was pressing him down; and now, assisted by his
struggles, it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the
abyss below!With a desperate effort he turned on his side, caught the
body,--as such it was,--dragged it back on the ledge, at the same
moment that, freeing his head from its covering,--a feminine skirt,--he
discovered it was a woman!She had been also unconscious, although the touch of his cold, wet hand
on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself
in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes.Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward
her, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt,
and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned.She was a tall,
handsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in
her torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were
split into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown
beneath."What--is it?--what has happened?"she said faintly, yet with a slight
touch of formality in her manner."You must have fallen--from the road above," said Bray hesitatingly.she repeated, with a slight frown, as if to
concentrate her thought.She glanced upward, then at the ledge before
her, and then, for the first time, at the darkening abyss below.The
color, which had begun to return, suddenly left her face here, and
she drew instinctively back against the mountain side."Yes," she half
murmured to herself, rather than to him, "it must be so.I was walking
too near the bank--and--I fell!"Then turning to him, she said, "And you
found me lying here when you came.""I think," stammered Bray, "that I was here when you fell, and I--I
broke the fall."She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him, saw the dust, dirt, and leaves
on his back and shoulders, the collar of his shirt torn open, and a
few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead.Her black eyebrows
straightened again as she said coldly, "Dear me!I am very sorry; I
couldn't help it, you know."But you, are you sure you are not injured?"I'm not hurt," she said, helping herself to her feet by the aid of the
mountain-side bushes, and ignoring his proffered hand."But," she
added quickly and impressively, glancing upward toward the stage road
overhead, "why don't they come?I must have
been here a long time; it's too bad!""Yes," she said impatiently, "of course!I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under
the trees.My foot must have slipped up
there--and--I--slid--down.Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness.But on turning around in her
impatience, she caught sight of the chasm again, and lapsed quite white
against the mountain side."Let me give you some water from the spring," he said eagerly, as she
sank again to a sitting posture; "it will refresh you."He looked hesitatingly around him; he had neither cup nor flask, but he
filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips.She drank
a little, extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket, dipped
its point in the water, and wiped her face delicately, after a certain
feline fashion.Then, catching sight of some small object in the fork of
a bush above her, she quickly pounced upon it, and with a swift sweep
of her hand under her skirt, put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER, and stood on her
feet again."How does one get out of such a place?"she asked fretfully, and then,
glancing at him half indignantly, "why don't you shout?""I was going to tell you," he said gently, "that when you are a little
stronger, we can get out by the way I came in,--along the trail."He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline.Somehow,
with this tall, beautiful creature beside him, it looked more perilous
than before.She may have thought so too, for she drew in her breath
sharply and sank down again.she asked suddenly, opening her
gray eyes upon him.she went on, almost
impertinently.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.He stopped, and then it suddenly occurred
to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this
tall, good-looking girl, even if he HAD saved her.He gave a little
laugh, and added mischievously, "Just like Jack and Jill, you know."she said sharply, bending her black brows at him."Jack and Jill," he returned carelessly; "I broke my crown, you know,
and YOU,"--he did not finish.She stared at him, trying to keep her face and her composure; but a
smile, that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable, here
lifted the corners of her mouth, and she turned her face aside.But
the smile, and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed, were
unfortunately on the side toward him.Emboldened by this, he went on,
"I couldn't think what had happened.At first I had a sort of idea that
part of a mule's pack had fallen on top of me,--blankets, flour, and all
that sort of thing, you know, until"--

Her smile had vanished."Well," she said impatiently, "until?"I'm afraid I gave you a shock; my hand was
dripping from the spring."She  so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the
time, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been
half torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it.When and how
had she managed to do it without his detecting the act?"At all events," she said coldly, "I'm glad you have not received
greater injury from--your mule pack.""I think we've both been very lucky," he said simply.She did not reply, but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail."I thought I heard voices," she said, half rising.You say there's no use--there's only this way out of it!""I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he
suggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the
abyss.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There's a dreadful fascination in it even now.I think I'd rather
go--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may
be weaker."She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently
agitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,
ladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a
heightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved
from the ledge toward the trail.John went to the garden."But it's only wide enough for ONE, and I never--NEVER--could even stand
on it a minute alone!""We will go together, side by side," he
said quietly, "but you will have to take the outside.""I shall keep hold of you," he explained; "you need not fear that.He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief
which he wore around his shoulders, knotted one end of it firmly to his
belt, and handed her the other."Do you think you can hold on to that?""I--don't know,"--she hesitated.He pointed to a girdle of yellow
leather which caught her tunic around her small waist."Yes," she said eagerly, "it's real leather."He gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it.They were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief."I feel much safer," she said, with a faint smile."But if I should fall," he remarked, looking into her eyes, "you would
go too!"It would be really Jack
and Jill this time.""Now I must take YOUR arm," he said
laughingly; "not you MINE."He passed his arm under hers, holding it
firmly.For the first few steps her
uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side, which seemed
to slip sideways beneath her.He was literally carrying her on his
shoulder.But in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself,
always leaning toward the hillside, and presently she was able to help
him by a few steps."It's nothing; I carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop."She stiffened slightly under this remark, and indeed so far overdid her
attempt to walk without his aid, that her foot slipped on a stone,
and she fell outward toward the abyss.But in an instant his arm was
transferred from her elbow to her waist, and in the momentum of his
quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side."I'm afraid you'd have spilt the pail that time," she said, with a
slightly heightened color, as she disengaged herself gently from his
arm."No," he answered boldly, "for the pail never would have stiffened
itself in a tiff, and tried to go alone.""Of course not, if it were only a pail," she responded.The trail was growing a little steeper
toward the upper end and the road bank.Bray was often himself obliged
to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them.Bray listened; he could hear at intervals a far-off shout; then a nearer
one--a name--"Eugenia."A sudden glow of
pleasure came over him--he knew not why, except that she did not look
delighted, excited, or even relieved."Only a few yards more," he said, with an unaffected half sigh."Then I'd better untie this," she suggested, beginning to fumble at the
knot of the handkerchief which linked them.Their heads were close together, their fingers often met; he would have
liked to say something, but he could only add: "Are you sure you will
feel quite safe?It is a little steeper as we near the bank.""You can hold me," she replied simply, with a superbly unconscious
lifting of her arm, as she yielded her waist to him again, but without
raising her eyes.He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the
remaining <DW72>, for it seemed to him as a last embrace.As he lifted
her to the road bank, the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw
two men and a woman running down the hill toward them.In that instant she had slipped the tattered dust-coat from her
shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly
awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to
shame their excitement.He noticed, too, with the quick perception of
unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that
she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was
wearing it on her breast."You have alarmed us beyond measure--kept the stage waiting, and now it
is gone!"said the younger man, with brotherly brusqueness.As these questions were all uttered in the same breath, Eugenia replied
to them collectively."It was so hot that I kept along the bank here,
while you were on the other side.I heard the trickle of water somewhere
down there, and searching for it my foot slipped.This gentleman"--she
indicated Bray--"was on a little sort of a trail there, and assisted me
back to the road again."The two men and the woman turned and stared at Bray with a look of
curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern.They
saw a youngish sort of man, with a long mustache, a two days' growth of
beard, a not overclean face, that was further streaked with red on the
temple, a torn flannel shirt, that showed a very white shoulder beside
a sunburnt throat and neck, and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy
high boots--in fact, the picture of a broken-down miner.But their
unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect
ease and equality with which he regarded them, a regard the more
exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some
satire or humor in the situation.I--er"--

"The lady has thanked me," interrupted Bray, with a smile.said the younger man to Eugenia, ignoring Bray."Not far," she answered, with a half appealing look at Bray."Only a few feet," added the latter, with prompt mendacity, "just a
little slip down."The three new-comers here turned away, and, surrounding Eugenia,
conversed in an undertone.Quite conscious that he was the subject of
discussion, Bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance
from Eugenia.The words "YOU do it," "No, YOU!""It would come better
from HER," were distinctly audible to him.To his surprise, however,
she suddenly broke through them, and advancing to him, with a dangerous
brightness in her beautiful eyes, held out her slim hand.Neworth, my brother, Harry Neworth, and my aunt, Mrs.Dobbs," she
said, indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome
head, "all think I ought to give you something and send you away.I
believe that is the way they put it.I come to
ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me
to-day--which I shall never forget."When he had returned her firm
handclasp for a minute, she coolly rejoined the discomfited group."She's no sardine," said Bray to himself emphatically, "but I suspect
she'll catch it from her folks for this.I ought to have gone away at
once, like a gentleman, hang it!"He was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow
her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed
up the hill with her, when he reflected that it would only make matters
worse.And with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had
not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades.He
had forgotten them for these lazy, snobbish, purse-proud San
Franciscans--for Bray had the miner's supreme contempt for the moneyed
trading classes.He flung himself over
the bank, and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring.But here
again he lingered--the place had become suddenly hallowed.He gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any
trace that she had left--a bow, a bit of ribbon, or even a hairpin that
had fallen from her.As the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own
reflection in the spring.It certainly was not that of an Adonis!Sandra went back to the bathroom.He laughed honestly; his sense of humor had saved him from many an
extravagance, and mitigated many a disappointment before this.She
was a plucky, handsome girl--even if she was not for him, and he might
never set eyes on her again.Yet it was a hard pull up that trail once
more, carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once
sustained a lovely girl!He remembered her reply to his badinage,
"Of course not--if it were only a pail," and found a dozen pretty
interpretations of it.He was too poor and
too level headed for that!And he was unaffectedly and materially tired,
too, when he reached the road again, and rested, leaving the spring and
its little idyl behind.By this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the Eureka Company,
and the stage road was also in shadow, so that his return through its
heavy dust was less difficult.And when he at last reached the camp, he
found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by
his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment; for
it appeared that a well-known San Francisco capitalist, whom the
foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and
investment, had actually come over from Red Dog for that purpose, and
had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident, and
delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to Sacramento without
making his examination."That was only his excuse--mere flap-doodle!"interrupted the
pessimistic Jerrold."He was foolin' you; he'd heard of suthin better!The idea of calling that affair an 'accident,' or one that would stop
any man who meant business!""A d----d fool woman's accident," broke in the misogynist Parkhurst,
"and it's true!That's what makes it so cussed mean.For there's allus
a woman at the bottom of such things--bet your life!Think of 'em comin'
here.Thar ought to be a law agin it.""Why, what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him
his daughter and auntie to'see the wonderful scenery with popa
dear!'as if it was a cheap Sunday-school panorama!And what do these
chuckle-headed women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin'
about, and playin' 'here we go round the mulberry bush' until one of 'em
tumbles down a ravine.and 'dear popa'
was up and down the road yellin' 'Me cheyld!And then there
was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got, and the coach
goes off, and 'popa dear' gets left, and then has to hurry off in a
buggy to catch it.So WE get left too, just because that God-forsaken
fool, Neworth, brings his women here."Under this recital poor Bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair
daughter of Neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring.Sandra moved to the office.It was HIS delay and dalliance with her
that had checked Neworth's visit; worse than that, it was his subsequent
audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal
of the negotiations.He had shipwrecked his partners' prospects in his
absurd vanity and pride!He did not dare to raise his eyes to their
dejected faces.He would have confessed everything to them, but the
same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her
adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips.How might they not
misconstrue his conduct--and HERS!Perhaps something of this was visible
in his face."Come, old man," said the cheerful misogynist, with perfect innocence,
"don't take it so hard.Some time in a man's life a woman's sure to get
the drop on him, as I said afore, and this yer woman's got the drop on
five of us!But--hallo, Ned, old man--what's the matter with your head?"He laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner."I had--a slip--on the trail," he stammered."Had to go back again for
another pailful.That's what delayed me, you know, boys," he added.ejaculated Parkhurst, clapping him on the back and twisting
him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions.Look at him, gentlemen; and he says it's 'nothing.'That's how a MAN
takes it!HE didn't go round yellin' and wringin' his hands and sayin'
'Me pay-l!He just humped himself and trotted
back for another.And yet every drop of water in that overset bucket
meant hard work and hard sweat, and was as precious as gold."Luckily for Bray, whose mingled emotions under Parkhurst's eloquence
were beginning to be hysterical, the foreman interrupted.it's time we got to work again, and took another heave at
the old ledge!But now that this job of Neworth's is over--I don't mind
tellin' ye suthin."As their leader usually spoke but little, and to
the point, the four men gathered around him."Although I engineered this
affair, and got it up, somehow, I never SAW that Neworth standing on
this ledge!The look of superstition
which Bray and the others had often seen on this old miner's face,
and which so often showed itself in his acts, was there."And though I
wanted him to come, and allowed to have him come, I'm kinder relieved
that he didn't, and so let whatsoever luck's in the air come to us five
alone, boys, just as we stand."The next morning Bray was up before his companions, and although it was
not his turn, offered to bring water from the spring.He was not in love
with Eugenia--he had not forgotten his remorse of the previous day--but
he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her
image from his mind.And he had heard that although Neworth had gone on
to Sacramento, his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or
two at the ditch superintendent's house on the summit, only two miles
away.She might pass on the road; he might get a glimpse of her again
and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever, and he should
have to take up the daily routine of his work again.It was not love--of
THAT he was assured--but it was the way to stop it by convincing himself
of its madness.Besides, in view of all the circumstances, it was his
duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the
accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it.He found the
spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscurity,--a
mere niche in the mountain side that held only--water!The stage road
was deserted save for an early, curly-headed schoolboy, whom he found
lurking on the bank, but who evaded his company and conversation.He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy.His late zeal as a
water-carrier had earned him a day or two's exemption from that duty.His place was taken the next afternoon by the woman-hating Parkhurst,
and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same
afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento.The new water-bringer was
as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his
predecessor!His unfortunate
partners, toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge, were
clamorous from thirst, and Bray was becoming absurdly uneasy.It could
not be possible that Eugenia's accident had been repeated!The mystery
was presently cleared, however, by the abrupt appearance of Parkhurst
running towards them, but WITHOUT HIS PAIL!John moved to the kitchen.The cry of consternation and
despair which greeted that discovery was, however, quickly changed by
a single breathless, half intelligible sentence he had shot before him
from his panting lips.And he was holding something in his outstretched
palm that was more eloquent than words.In an instant they had him under the shade of the pine-tree, and were
squatting round him like schoolboys.His story, far from being brief, was incoherent and at times seemed
irrelevant, but that was characteristic.They would remember that he had
always held the theory that, even in quartz mining, the deposits were
always found near water, past or present, with signs of fluvial erosion!He didn't call himself one of your blanked scientific miners, but his
head was level!It was all very well for them to say "Yes, yes!"NOW,
but they didn't use to!when he got to the spring, he noticed
that there had been a kind of landslide above it, of course, from water
cleavage, and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side,
where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes!Excited as Bray was, he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track
made by Eugenia in her fall, which he himself had noticed."When I saw that," continued Parkhurst, more rapidly and coherently,
"I saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came
through--as if it had been the old channel of the spring.I widened it
a little with my clasp knife, and then--in a little pouch or pocket of
decomposed quartz--I found that!Not only that, boys," he continued,
rising, with a shout, "but the whole <DW72> above the spring is a mass of
seepage underneath, as if you'd played a hydraulic hose on it, and it's
ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz!"The men leaped to their feet; in another moment they had snatched picks,
pans, and shovels, and, the foreman leading, with a coil of rope thrown
over his shoulders, were all flying down the trail to the highway.The spring was not on THEIR claim; it was known to
others; it was doubtful if Parkhurst's discovery with his knife amounted
to actual WORK on the soil.They must "take it up" with a formal notice,
and get to work at once!In an hour they were scattered over the mountain side, like bees
clinging to the fragrant <DW72> of laurel and myrtle above the spring.An
excavation was made beside it, and the ledge broadened by a dozen
feet.Even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled
prospecting pans.And when the Pioneer Coach slowly toiled up the road
that afternoon, the passengers stared at the scarcely dry "Notice of
Location" pinned to the pine by the road bank, whence Eugenia had fallen
two days before!Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray worked with his companions, it was
with more conflicting feelings.There was a certain sense of desecration
in their act.How her proud lip would have curled had she seen him--he
who but a few hours before would have searched the whole <DW72> for
the treasure of a ribbon, a handkerchief, or a bow from her dress--now
delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so
mysteriously disclosed.Mysteriously he believed, for he had not fully
accepted Parkhurst's story.That gentle misogynist had never been an
active prospector; an inclination to theorize without practice and to
combat his partners' experience were all against his alleged process of
discovery, although the gold was actually there; and his conduct that
afternoon was certainly peculiar.He did but little of the real
work; but wandered from man to man, with suggestions, advice, and
exhortations, and the air of a superior patron.This might have been
characteristic, but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and
watchfulness.He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail,
staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance, and at times falling
into fits of strange abstraction.At other times he would draw near to
one of his fellow partners, as if for confidential disclosure, and then
check himself and wander aimlessly away.And it was not until evening
came that the mystery was solved.The prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined, the <DW72> above
and below had been fully explored and tested, with a result and promise
that outran their most sanguine hopes.There was no mistaking the fact
that they had made a "big" strike.That singular gravity and reticence,
so often observed in miners at these crises, had come over them as
they sat that night for the last time around their old camp-fire on
the Eureka ledge, when Parkhurst turned impulsively to Bray."Roll over
here," he said in a whisper."I want to tell ye suthin!"Bray "rolled" beyond the squatting circle, and the two men gradually
edged themselves out of hearing of the others.In the silent abstraction
that prevailed nobody noticed them."It's got suthin to do with this discovery," said Parkhurst, in a low,
mysterious tone, "but as far as the gold goes, and our equal rights to
it as partners, it don't affect them.If I," he continued in a slightly
patronizing, paternal tone, "choose to make you and the other boys
sharers in what seems to be a special Providence to ME, I reckon we
won't quarrel on it.It's one
of those things ye read about in books and don't take any stock in!But
we've got the gold--and I've got the black and white to prove it--even
if it ain't exactly human."His voice sank so low, his manner was so impressive, that despite his
known exaggeration, Bray felt a slight thrill of superstition.Meantime
Parkhurst wiped his brow, took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of
laurel from his pocket, and drew a long breath."When I got to the spring this afternoon," he went on, in a nervous,
tremulous, and scarcely audible voice, "I saw this bit o' paper, folded
note-wise, lyin' on the ledge before it.On top of it was this sprig
of laurel, to catch the eye.I ain't the man to pry into other folks'
secrets, or read what ain't mine.But on the back o' this note was
written 'To Jack!'It's a common enough name, but it's a singular thing,
ef you'll recollect, thar ain't ANOTHER Jack in this company, not on the
whole ridge betwixt this and the summit, except MYSELF!So I opened it,
and this is what it read!"He held the paper sideways toward the leaping
light of the still near camp-fire, and read slowly, with the emphasis of
having read it many times before."'I want you to believe that I, at least, respect and honor your honest,
manly calling, and when you strike it rich, as you surely will, I hope
you will sometimes think of Jill.'"In the thrill of joy, hope, and fear that came over Bray, he could see
that Parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret, but had not
even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion."But do you
know anybody named Jill?""It's no NAME," said Parkhurst in a sombre voice, "it's a THING!""Yes, a measure--you know--two fingers of whiskey.""Oh, a 'gill,'" said Bray."That's what I said, young man," returned Parkhurst gravely.Bray choked back a hysterical laugh; spelling was notoriously not one of
Parkhurst's strong points."But what has a 'gill' got to do with it?""It's one of them Sphinx things, don't you see?A sort of riddle or
rebus, you know.You've got to study it out, as them old chaps did."Pints, I suppose," said Bray."QUARTZ, and there you are.So I looked about me for quartz, and sure
enough struck it the first pop."Bray cast a quick look at Parkhurst's grave face.The man was evidently
impressed and sincere.or you'll spoil the charm, and bring us ill luck!I really don't know that you ought to have told
me," added the artful Bray, dissembling his intense joy at this proof of
Eugenia's remembrance."But," said Parkhurst blankly, "you see, old man, you'd been the last
man at the spring, and I kinder thought"--

"Don't think," said Bray promptly, "and above all, don't talk; not a
word to the boys of this.I've
got to go to San Francisco next week, and I'll take care of it and think
it out!"He knew that Parkhurst might be tempted to talk, but without
the paper his story would be treated lightly.Parkhurst handed him the
paper, and the two men returned to the camp-fire.The superstition of the lover is
no less keen than that of the gambler, and Bray, while laughing at
Parkhurst's extravagant fancy, I am afraid was equally inclined to
believe that their good fortune came through Eugenia's influence.At least he should tell her so, and her precious note became now an
invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her.The only fear that
possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of
her note before she left that afternoon; the only thing he could not
understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring,
for she could not have taken it herself.But this would doubtless be
explained by her in San Francisco, whither he intended to seek her.His
affairs, the purchasing of machinery for their new claim, would no doubt
give him easy access to her father.But it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and
fashionable outfit in San Francisco, and quite another to stand before
the "palatial" residence of the Neworths on Rincon Hill, with the
consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the Neworths'
discourtesy on the mountain, and, even in his fine feathers, Bray
hesitated.At this moment a carriage rolled up to the door, and Eugenia,
an adorable vision of laces and silks, alighted.Forgetting everything else, he advanced toward her with outstretched
hand.He saw her start, a faint color come into her face; he knew he
was recognized; but she stiffened quickly again, the color vanished, her
beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment, and then, with
the faintest inclination of her proud head, she swept by him and entered
the house.But Bray, though shocked, was not daunted, and perhaps his own pride was
awakened.He ran to his hotel, summoned a messenger, inclosed her note
in an envelope, and added these lines:--


DEAR MISS NEWORTH,--I only wanted to thank you an hour ago, as I should
like to have done before, for the kind note which I inclose, but which
you have made me feel I have no right to treasure any longer, and to
tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than
fulfilled.Yours, very gratefully,

EDMUND BRAY.Within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply:--

"Miss Neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good
fortune which prevented Mr.Bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her
foolish note."Cold as this response was, Bray's heart leaped.She HAD lingered on the
summit, and HAD expected a reply.He seized his hat, and, jumping into
the first cab at the hotel door, drove rapidly back to the house.He
had but one idea, to see her at any cost, but one concern, to avoid a
meeting with her father first, or a denial at her very door.He dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the
house.It had a large garden in the rear, reclaimed from the adjacent
"scrub oak" infested sand hill, and protected by a high wall.If he
could scale that wall, he could command the premises.It was a bright
morning; she might be tempted into the garden.A taller scrub oak grew
near the wall; to the mountain-bred Bray it was an easy matter to swing
himself from it to the wall, and he did.But his momentum was so great
that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden
to save himself from falling there.He heard a little cry, felt his feet
strike some tin utensil, and rolled on the ground beside Eugenia and her
overturned watering-pot.They both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to
laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each."But we are not on the mountains now, Mr.Bray," said Eugenia, taking
her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening
eyebrows."But we are quits," said Bray.I only
came here to tell you why I could not answer your letter the same day.I
never got it--I mean," he added hurriedly, "another man got it first."She threw up her head, and her face grew pale."ANOTHER man got it," she
repeated, "and YOU let another man"--

"No, no," interrupted Bray imploringly.One of my
partners went to the spring that afternoon, and found it; but he neither
knows who sent it, nor for whom it was intended."He hastily recounted
Parkhurst's story, his mysterious belief, and his interpretation of
the note.The color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and
eyes."I had gone twice to the spring after I saw you, but I couldn't
bear its deserted look without you," he added boldly.Here, seeing her
face grew grave again, he added, "But how did you get the letter to the
spring?and how did you know that it was found that day?"It was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating, but the combination
was charming in her proud face."I got the little schoolboy at the
summit," she said, with girlish hesitation, "to take the note.He knew
the spring, but he didn't know YOU.I told him--it was very foolish, I
know--to wait until you came for water, to be certain that you got the
note, to wait until you came up, for I thought you might question him,
or give him some word.""But," she added,
and her lip took a divine pout, "he said he waited TWO HOURS; that you
never took the LEAST CONCERN of the letter or him, but went around the
mountain side, peering and picking in every hole and corner of it, and
then he got tired and ran away.Of course I understand it now, it wasn't
YOU; but oh, please; I beg you, Mr.Bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught, and which
had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment."And now, don't you think, Mr.Bray," she added demurely, "that you had
better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door
and call upon me properly?""But your father"--

"My father, as a well-known investor, regrets exceedingly that he did
not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview.He is, as your foreman knows, exceedingly interested in the mines on
Eureka ledge.She led him to a little
door in the wall, which she unbolted."And now 'Jill' must say good-by
to 'Jack,' for she must make herself ready to receive a Mr.And when Bray a little later called at the front door, he was
respectfully announced.He called another day, and many days after.He
came frequently to San Francisco, and one day did not return to his old
partners.He had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared
"had made the first strike on Eureka mountain."BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER


I

When Joshua Bilson, of the Summit House, Buckeye Hill, lost his wife,
it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the
management of the hotel.Already all Buckeye had considered this a mere
preliminary to taking another wife, after a decent probation, as the
relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate,
and Bilson was a man, and not above female influence.There was,
however, some change of opinion on that point when Miss Euphemia Trotter
was engaged for that position.Buckeye Hill, which had confidently
looked forward to a buxom widow or, with equal confidence, to the
promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid, was startled
by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age, and above the medium
height, at once serious, precise, and masterful, and to all appearances
outrageously competent.More carefully "taking stock" of her, it was
accepted she had three good points,--dark, serious eyes, a trim but
somewhat thin figure, and well-kept hands and feet.These, which in
so susceptible a community would have been enough, in the words of one
critic, "to have married her to three men," she seemed to make of little
account herself, and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make
them of account was ceremonious and frigid.Indeed, she seemed to occupy
herself entirely with looking after the servants, Chinese and Europeans,
examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers, in a fashion
that made her respected and--feared.It was whispered, in fact, that
Bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife, and that he was
"henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet."Nevertheless, he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence
that seemed incompatible with their relative positions.It gave rise
to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting: Miss Trotter had a
secret interest in the hotel, and represented a San Francisco syndicate;
Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property, and had advanced large
sums to Bilson; Miss Trotter was a woman of no property, but she was
the only daughter of--variously--a late distinguished nobleman, a ruined
millionaire, and a foreign statesman, bent on making her own living.Miss Euphemia Trotter, or "Miss E. Trotter," as she
preferred to sign herself, loathing her sentimental prefix, was really
a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary, where
she eventually became a teacher.She had survived her parents and a
neglected childhood, and had worked hard for her living since she
was fourteen.She had been a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a
reformatory, had observed men and women under conditions of pain and
weakness, and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness
and suffering; yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy
which she used equally to herself as to others.That she had ever
indulged in any romance of human existence, I greatly doubt; the lanky
girl teacher at the Vermont academy had enough to do to push herself
forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences, and so
became a prematurely hard duenna, paid to look out for, restrain, and
report, if necessary, any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her
companions.A pronounced "old maid" at fifteen, she had nothing to
forget or forgive in others, and still less to learn from them.It was spring, and down the long <DW72>s of Buckeye Hill the flowers were
already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains, and the
