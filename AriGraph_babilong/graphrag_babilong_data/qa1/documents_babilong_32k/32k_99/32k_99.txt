"I feel as if I wanted to take my stand out
on the common, and, in the face of the whole world, declare what I have
done for Mary Leavenworth.But first," she whispered, "tell me, for
God's sake, how those girls are situated.I have not dared to ask or
write.The papers say a good deal about Eleanore, but nothing about
Mary; and yet Mary writes of her own peril only, and of the danger she
would be in if certain facts were known.I don't want
to injure them, only to take care of myself."Belden," I said, "Eleanore Leavenworth has got into her
present difficulty by not telling all that was required of her.Mary
Leavenworth--but I cannot speak of her till I know what you have to
divulge.Her position, as well as that of her cousin, is too anomalous
for either you or me to discuss.What we want to learn from you is, how
you became connected with this affair, and what it was that Hannah knew
which caused her to leave New York and take refuge here."Belden, clasping and unclasping her hands, met my gaze with one
full of the most apprehensive doubt."You will never believe me," she
cried; "but I don't know what Hannah knew.I am in utter ignorance of
what she saw or heard on that fatal night; she never told, and I never
asked.She merely said that Miss Leavenworth wished me to secrete her
for a short time; and I, because I loved Mary Leavenworth and admired
her beyond any one I ever saw, weakly consented, and----"

"Do you mean to say," I interrupted, "that after you knew of the murder,
you, at the mere expression of Miss Leavenworth's wishes, continued to
keep this girl concealed without asking her any questions or demanding
any explanations?""Yes, sir; you will never believe me, but it is so.I thought that,
since Mary had sent her here, she must have her reasons; and--and--I
cannot explain it now; it all looks so differently; but I did do as I
have said."You must have had strong reason for
obeying Mary Leavenworth so blindly.""Oh, sir," she gasped, "I thought I understood it all; that Mary, the
bright young creature, who had stooped from her lofty position to make
use of me and to love me, was in some way linked to the criminal, and
that it would be better for me to remain in ignorance, do as I was
bid, and trust all would come right.I did not reason about it; I only
followed my impulse.I couldn't do otherwise; it isn't my nature.When I
am requested to do anything for a person I love, I cannot refuse.""And you love Mary Leavenworth; a woman whom you yourself seem to
consider capable of a great crime?""Oh, I didn't say that; I don't know as I thought that.She might be in
some way connected with it, without being the actual perpetrator.She
could never be that; she is too dainty."Belden," I said, "what do you know of Mary Leavenworth which makes
even that supposition possible?"The white face of the woman before me flushed."I scarcely know what to
reply," she cried."It is a long story, and----"

"Never mind the long story," I interrupted."Let me hear the one vital
reason.""Well," said she, "it is this; that Mary was in an emergency from which
nothing but her uncle's death could release her."But here we were interrupted by the sound of steps on the porch, and,
looking out, I saw Q entering the house alone.Belden where
she was, I stepped into the hall."Well," said I, "what is the matter?"No, gone away; off in a buggy to look after a man that was found some
ten miles from here, lying in a ditch beside a yoke of oxen."Then, as
he saw my look of relief, for I was glad of this temporary delay, said,
with an expressive wink: "It would take a fellow a long time to go to
him--if he wasn't in a hurry--hours, I think.""Very; no horse I could get could travel it faster than a walk.""Well," said I, "so much the better for us.Belden has a long story
to tell, and----"

"Doesn't wish to be interrupted."Yes, sir; if he has to hobble on two sticks.""At what time do you look for him?""_You_ will look for him as early as three o'clock.I shall be among the
mountains, ruefully eying my broken-down team."And leisurely donning
his hat he strolled away down the street like one who has the whole day
on his hands and does not know what to do with it.Belden's story, she at once
composed herself to the task, with the following result.BELDEN'S NARRATIVE


    "Cursed, destructive Avarice,
     Thou everlasting foe to Love and Honor.""Mischief never thrives
     Without the help of Woman."IT will be a year next July since I first saw Mary Leavenworth.I
was living at that time a most monotonous existence.Loving what was
beautiful, hating what was sordid, drawn by nature towards all that
was romantic and uncommon, but doomed by my straitened position and the
loneliness of my widowhood to spend my days in the weary round of plain
sewing, I had begun to think that the shadow of a humdrum old age
was settling down upon me, when one morning, in the full tide of my
dissatisfaction, Mary Leavenworth stepped across the threshold of my
door and, with one smile, changed the whole tenor of my life.This may seem exaggeration to you, especially when I say that her errand
was simply one of business, she having heard I was handy with my needle;
but if you could have seen her as she appeared that day, marked the look
with which she approached me, and the smile with which she left, you
would pardon the folly of a romantic old woman, who beheld a fairy queen
in this lovely young lady.The fact is, I was dazzled by her beauty and
her charms.And when, a few days after, she came again, and crouching
down on the stool at my feet, said she was so tired of the gossip and
tumult down at the hotel, that it was a relief to run away and hide with
some one who would let her act like the child she was, I experienced
for the moment, I believe, the truest happiness of my life.Meeting her
advances with all the warmth her manner invited, I found her ere long
listening eagerly while I told her, almost without my own volition, the
story of my past life, in the form of an amusing allegory.The next day saw her in the same place; and the next; always with the
eager, laughing eyes, and the fluttering, uneasy hands, that grasped
everything they touched, and broke everything they grasped.But the fourth day she was not there, nor the fifth, nor the sixth, and
I was beginning to feel the old shadow settling back upon me, when one
night, just as the dusk of twilight was merging into evening gloom, she
came stealing in at the front door, and, creeping up to my side, put her
hands over my eyes with such a low, ringing laugh, that I started."You don't know what to make of me!"she cried, throwing aside her
cloak, and revealing herself in the full splendor of evening attire."I
don't know what to make of myself.Though it seems folly, I felt that
I must run away and tell some one that a certain pair of eyes have been
looking into mine, and that for the first time in my life I feel
myself a woman as well as a queen."And with a glance in which coyness
struggled with pride, she gathered up her cloak around her, and
laughingly cried:

"Have you had a visit from a flying sprite?Has one little ray of
moonlight found its way into your prison for a wee moment, with Mary's
laugh and Mary's snowy silk and flashing diamonds?and she patted
my cheek, and smiled so bewilderingly, that even now, with all the
dull horror of these after-events crowding upon me, I cannot but feel
something like tears spring to my eyes at the thought of it."And so the Prince has come for you?"I whispered, alluding to a story I
had told her the last time she had visited me; a story in which a girl,
who had waited all her life in rags and degradation for the lordly
knight who was to raise her from a hovel to a throne, died just as her
one lover, an honest peasant-lad whom she had discarded in her pride,
arrived at her door with the fortune he had spent all his days in
amassing for her sake.But at this she flushed, and drew back towards the door."I don't know;
I am afraid not.I--I don't think anything about that.Princes are not
so easily won," she murmured.But she only shook her fairy head, and replied: "No, no; that would be
spoiling the romance, indeed.I have come upon you like a sprite, and
like a sprite I will go."And, flashing like the moonbeam she was, she
glided out into the night, and floated away down the street.When she next came, I observed a feverish excitement in her manner,
which assured me, even plainer than the coy sweetness displayed in
our last interview, that her heart had been touched by her lover's
attentions.Indeed, she hinted as much before she left, saying in a
melancholy tone, when I had ended my story in the usual happy way, with
kisses and marriage, "I shall never marry!"finishing the exclamation
with a long-drawn sigh, that somehow emboldened me to say, perhaps
because I knew she had no mother:

"And why?What reason can there be for such rosy lips saying their
possessor will never marry?"She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes.I feared I had
offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in
an even but low tone, "I said I should never marry, because the one man
who pleases me can never be my husband."All the hidden romance in my nature started at once into life."There is nothing to tell," said she; "only I have been so weak as
to"--she would not say, fall in love, she was a proud woman--"admire a
man whom my uncle will never allow me to marry."And she rose as if to go; but I drew her back."Whom your uncle will not
allow you to marry!""No; uncle loves money, but not to such an extent as that.He is the owner of a beautiful place in his own
country----"

"Own country?""No," she returned; "he is an Englishman."I did not see why she need say that in just the way she did, but,
supposing she was aggravated by some secret memory, went on to inquire:
"Then what difficulty can there be?Isn't he--" I was going to say
steady, but refrained."He is an Englishman," she emphasized in the same bitter tone as
before."In saying that, I say it all.Uncle will never let me marry an
Englishman."Such a puerile reason as this had never
entered my mind."He has an absolute mania on the subject," resumed she."I might as well
ask him to allow me to drown myself as to marry an Englishman."A woman of truer judgment than myself would have said: "Then, if that is
so, why not discard from your breast all thought of him?Why dance with
him, and talk to him, and let your admiration develop into love?"But
I was all romance then, and, angry at a prejudice I could neither
understand nor appreciate, I said:

"But that is mere tyranny!And why,
if he does, should you feel yourself obliged to gratify him in a whim so
unreasonable?""Yes," I returned; "tell me everything.""Well, then, if you want to know the worst of me, as you already know
the best, I hate to incur my uncle's displeasure, because--because--I
have always been brought up to regard myself as his heiress, and I
know that if I were to marry contrary to his wishes, he would instantly
change his mind, and leave me penniless.""But," I cried, my romance a little dampened by this admission, "you
tell me Mr.Clavering has enough to live upon, so you would not want;
and if you love--"

Her violet eyes fairly flashed in her amazement."You don't understand," she said; "Mr.Clavering is not poor; but uncle
is rich.I shall be a queen--" There she paused, trembling, and falling
on my breast."Oh, it sounds mercenary, I know, but it is the fault of
my bringing up.And yet"--her whole face softening with the light of
another emotion, "I cannot say to Henry Clavering, 'Go!my prospects are
dearer to me than you!'said I, determined to get at the truth of the
matter if possible.If you knew me, you
would say it was."And, turning, she took her stand before a picture
that hung on the wall of my sitting-room.It was one of a pair of good photographs I possessed."Yes," I remarked, "that is why I prize it."She did not seem to hear me; she was absorbed in gazing at the exquisite
face before her."That is a winning face," I heard her say.I wonder if she would ever hesitate between love and money.I
do not believe she would," her own countenance growing gloomy and sad
as she said so; "she would think only of the happiness she would confer;
she is not hard like me.I think she had forgotten my presence, for at the mention of her
cousin's name she turned quickly round with a half suspicious look,
saying lightly:

"My dear old Mamma Hubbard looks horrified.Mary went to the bedroom.She did not know she had
such a very unromantic little wretch for a listener, when she was
telling all those wonderful stories of Love slaying dragons, and living
in caves, and walking over burning ploughshares as if they were tufts of
spring grass?""No," I said, taking her with an irresistible impulse of admiring
affection into my arms; "but if I had, it would have made no difference.I should still have talked about love, and of all it can do to make this
weary workaday world sweet and delightful."Then you do not think me such a wretch?"I thought her the winsomest being in the world, and
frankly told her so.Instantly she brightened into her very gayest self.Not that I thought then, much less do I think now, she partially
cared for my good opinion; but her nature demanded admiration, and
unconsciously blossomed under it, as a flower under the sunshine."And you will still let me come and tell you how bad I am,--that is, if
I go on being bad, as I doubtless shall to the end of the chapter?"Not if I should do a dreadful thing?Not if I should run away with my
lover some fine night, and leave uncle to discover how his affectionate
partiality had been requited?"It was lightly said, and lightly meant, for she did not even wait for my
reply.But its seed sank deep into our two hearts for all that.And for
the next few days I spent my time in planning how I should manage, if
it should ever fall to my lot to conduct to a successful issue so
enthralling a piece of business as an elopement.You may imagine, then,
how delighted I was, when one evening Hannah, this unhappy girl who
is now lying dead under my roof, and who was occupying the position of
lady's maid to Miss Mary Leavenworth at that time, came to my door with
a note from her mistress, running thus:


    "Have the loveliest story of the season ready for me tomorrow; and
    let the prince be as handsome as--as some one you have heard of,
    and the princess as foolish as your little yielding pet,

    "MARY."Which short note could only mean that she was engaged.But the next day
did not bring me my Mary, nor the next, nor the next; and beyond hearing
that Mr.Leavenworth had returned from his trip I received neither word
nor token.Two more days dragged by, when, just as twilight set in, she
came.It had been a week since I had seen her, but it might have been
a year from the change I observed in her countenance and expression.I
could scarcely greet her with any show of pleasure, she was so unlike
her former self."You
expected revelations, whispered hopes, and all manner of sweet
confidences; and you see, instead, a cold, bitter woman, who for
the first time in your presence feels inclined to be reserved and
uncommunicative.""That is because you have had more to trouble than encourage you in your
love," I returned, though not without a certain shrinking, caused more
by her manner than words.She did not reply to this, but rose and paced the floor, coldly at
first, but afterwards with a certain degree of excitement that proved
to be the prelude to a change in her manner; for, suddenly pausing, she
turned to me and said: "Mr."Yes, my uncle commanded me to dismiss him, and I obeyed."The work dropped from my hands, in my heartfelt disappointment."Yes; he had not been in the house five minutes before Eleanore told
him."I was foolish enough
to give her the cue in my first moment of joy and weakness.I did
not think of the consequences; but I might have known."I do not call it conscientiousness to tell another's secrets," I
returned."That is because you are not Eleanore."Not having a reply for this, I said, "And so your uncle did not regard
your engagement with favor?"Did I not tell you he would never allow me to marry an
Englishman?Let the hard, cruel man have his
way?"She was walking off to look again at that picture which had attracted
her attention the time before, but at this word gave me one little
sidelong look that was inexpressibly suggestive."I obeyed him when he commanded, if that is what you mean."Clavering after having given him your word of honor
to be his wife?""Why not, when I found I could not keep my word.""Then you have decided not to marry him?"She did not reply at once, but lifted her face mechanically to the
picture."My uncle would tell you that I had decided to be governed wholly by
his wishes!"she responded at last with what I felt was self-scornful
bitterness.and instantly blushed, startled that I had called her by her
first name."Is it not my manifest
duty to be governed by my uncle's wishes?Has he not brought me up from
childhood?made me all I am, even to the
love of riches which he has instilled into my soul with every gift he
has thrown into my lap, every word he has dropped into my ear, since I
was old enough to know what riches meant?Is it for me now to turn my
back upon fostering care so wise, beneficent, and free, just because
a man whom I have known some two weeks chances to offer me in exchange
what he pleases to call his love?""But," I feebly essayed, convinced perhaps by the tone of sarcasm in
which this was uttered that she was not far from my way of thinking
after all, "if in two weeks you have learned to love this man more than
everything else, even the riches which make your uncle's favor a thing
of such moment--"

"Well," said she, "what then?""Why, then I would say, secure your happiness with the man of your
choice, if you have to marry him in secret, trusting to your influence
over your uncle to win the forgiveness he never can persistently deny."You should have seen the arch expression which stole across her face
at that."Would it not be better," she asked, creeping to my arms, and
laying her head on my shoulder, "would it not be better for me to make
sure of that uncle's favor first, before undertaking the hazardous
experiment of running away with a too ardent lover?"Struck by her manner, I lifted her face and looked at it."Oh, my darling," said I, "you have not, then dismissed Mr."I have sent him away," she whispered demurely."Oh, you dear old Mamma Hubbard; what a matchmaker you are, to be sure!You appear as much interested as if you were the lover yourself.""He will wait for me," said she.The next day I submitted to her the plan I had formed for her
clandestine intercourse with Mr.It was for them both to
assume names, she taking mine, as one less liable to provoke conjecture
than a strange name, and he that of LeRoy Robbins.The plan pleased
her, and with the slight modification of a secret sign being used on the
envelope, to distinguish her letters from mine, was at once adopted.And so it was I took the fatal step that has involved me in all this
trouble.With the gift of my name to this young girl to use as she
would and sign what she would, I seemed to part with what was left me of
judgment and discretion.Henceforth, I was only her scheming, planning,
devoted slave; now copying the letters which she brought me, and
enclosing them to the false name we had agreed upon, and now busying
myself in devising ways to forward to her those which I received from
him, without risk of discovery.Hannah was the medium we employed, as
Mary felt it would not be wise for her to come too often to my house.To this girl's charge, then, I gave such notes as I could not forward in
any other way, secure in the reticence of her nature, as well as in her
inability to read, that these letters addressed to Mrs.Amy Belden would
arrive at their proper destination without mishap.At all events, no difficulty that I ever heard of arose out
of the use of this girl as a go-between.Clavering, who had left an invalid mother
in England, was suddenly summoned home.He prepared to go, but, flushed
with love, distracted by doubts, smitten with the fear that, once
withdrawn from the neighborhood of a woman so universally courted as
Mary, he would stand small chance of retaining his position in her
regard, he wrote to her, telling his fears and asking her to marry him
before he went."Make me your husband, and I will follow your wishes in all things,"
he wrote."The certainty that you are mine will make parting possible;
without it, I cannot go; no, not if my mother should die without the
comfort of saying good-bye to her only child."By some chance she was in my house when I brought this letter from the
post-office, and I shall never forget how she started when she read it.But, from looking as if she had received an insult, she speedily settled
down into a calm consideration of the subject, writing and delivering
into my charge for copying a few lines in which she promised to accede
to his request, if he would agree to leave the public declaration of the
marriage to her discretion, and consent to bid her farewell at the door
of the church or wherever the ceremony of marriage should take place,
never to come into her presence again till such declaration had been
made.Of course this brought in a couple of days the sure response:
"Anything, so you will be mine."And Amy Belden's wits and powers of planning were all summoned into
requisition for the second time, to devise how this matter could be
arranged without subjecting the parties to the chance of detection.In the first place, it was essential
that the marriage should come off within three days, Mr.Clavering
having, upon the receipt of her letter, secured his passage upon a
steamer that sailed on the following Saturday; and, next, both he and
Miss Leavenworth were too conspicuous in their personal appearance to
make it at all possible for them to be secretly married anywhere within
gossiping distance of this place.And yet it was desirable that the
scene of the ceremony should not be too far away, or the time occupied
in effecting the journey to and from the place would necessitate an
absence from the hotel on the part of Miss Leavenworth long enough to
arouse the suspicions of Eleanore; something which Mary felt it wiser
to avoid.Her uncle, I have forgotten to say, was not here--having gone
away again shortly after the apparent dismissal of Mr.F----, then, was the only town I could think of which combined the two
advantages of distance and accessibility.Although upon the railroad, it
was an insignificant place, and had, what was better yet, a very obscure
man for its clergyman, living, which was best of all, not ten rods from
the depot.Making inquiries, I found that it
could be done, and, all alive to the romance of the occasion, proceeded
to plan the details.And now I am coming to what might have caused the overthrow of the
whole scheme: I allude to the detection on the part of Eleanore of the
correspondence between Mary and Mr.Hannah,
who, in her frequent visits to my house, had grown very fond of my
society, had come in to sit with me for a while one evening.She had not
been in the house, however, more than ten minutes, before there came a
knock at the front door; and going to it I saw Mary, as I supposed, from
the long cloak she wore, standing before me.Thinking she had come with
a letter for Mr.Clavering, I grasped her arm and drew her into the
hall, saying, "Have you got it?I must post it to-night, or he will not
receive it in time."There I paused, for, the panting creature I had by the arm turning upon
me, I saw myself confronted by a stranger."You have made a mistake," she cried."I am Eleanore Leavenworth, and I
have come for my girl Hannah.I could only raise my hand in apprehension, and point to the girl
sitting in the corner of the room before her.Miss Leavenworth
immediately turned back."Hannah, I want you," said she, and would have left the house without
another word, but I caught her by the arm."Oh, miss--" I began, but she gave me such a look, I dropped her arm.And, with a glance to see if Hannah were following her,
she went out.For an hour I sat crouched on the stair just where she had left me.Then
I went to bed, but I did not sleep a wink that night.You can imagine,
then, my wonder when, with the first glow of the early morning light,
Mary, looking more beautiful than ever, came running up the steps and
into the room where I was, with the letter for Mr.I cried in my joy and relief, "didn't she understand me, then?"The gay look on Mary's face turned to one of reckless scorn."If you
mean Eleanore, yes.I couldn't keep it secret after the
mistake you made last evening; so I did the next best thing, told her
the truth.""Not that you were about to be married?""And you did not find her as angry as you expected?""I will not say that; she was angry enough.And yet," continued Mary,
with a burst of self-scornful penitence, "I will not call Eleanore's
lofty indignation anger.She was grieved, Mamma Hubbard, grieved."And
with a laugh which I believe was rather the result of her own relief
than of any wish to reflect on her cousin, she threw her head on one
side and eyed me with a look which seemed to say, "Do I plague you so
very much, you dear old Mamma Hubbard?"She did plague me, and I could not conceal it."And will she not tell
her uncle?"The naive expression on Mary's face quickly changed.I felt a heavy hand, hot with fever, lifted from my heart.The plan agreed upon between us for the carrying out of our intentions
was this.At the time appointed, Mary was to excuse herself to her
cousin upon the plea that she had promised to take me to see a friend
in the next town.She was then to enter a buggy previously ordered, and
drive here, where I was to join her.We were then to proceed immediately
to the minister's house in F----, where we had reason to believe we
should find everything prepared for us.But in this plan, simple as it
was, one thing was forgotten, and that was the character of Eleanore's
love for her cousin.That her suspicions would be aroused we did
not doubt; but that she would actually follow Mary up and demand an
explanation of her conduct, was what neither she, who knew her so well,
nor I, who knew her so little, ever imagined possible.Mary, who had followed out the
programme to the point of leaving a little note of excuse on Eleanore's
dressing-table, had come to my house, and was just taking off her long
cloak to show me her dress, when there came a commanding knock at
the front door.Hastily pulling her cloak about her I ran to open it,
intending, you may be sure, to dismiss my visitor with short ceremony,
when I heard a voice behind me say, "Good heavens, it is Eleanore!"and,
glancing back, saw Mary looking through the window-blind upon the porch
without.why, open the door and let her in; I am not afraid of Eleanore."I immediately did so, and Eleanore Leavenworth, very pale, but with
a resolute countenance, walked into the house and into this room,
confronting Mary in very nearly the same spot where you are now sitting."I have come," said she, lifting a face whose expression of mingled
sweetness and power I could not but admire, even in that moment of
apprehension, "to ask you without any excuse for my request, if you will
allow me to accompany you upon your drive this morning?"Mary, who had drawn herself up to meet some word of accusation or
appeal, turned carelessly away to the glass."I am very sorry," she
said, "but the buggy holds only two, and I shall be obliged to refuse.""But I do not wish your company, Eleanore.We are off on a pleasure
trip, and desire to have our fun by ourselves.""And you will not allow me to accompany you?""I cannot prevent your going in another carriage."Eleanore's face grew yet more earnest in its expression."Mary," said
she, "we have been brought up together.I am your sister in affection
if not in blood, and I cannot see you start upon this adventure with no
other companion than this woman.Then tell me, shall I go with you, as a
sister, or on the road behind you as the enforced guardian of your honor
against your will?""Now is it discreet or honorable in you to do this?"Mary's haughty lip took an ominous curve."The same hand that raised you
has raised me," she cried bitterly."This is no time to speak of that," returned Eleanore.All the antagonism of her nature was
aroused.She looked absolutely Juno-like in her wrath and reckless
menace."Eleanore," she cried, "I am going to F---- to marry Mr._Now_ do you wish to accompany me?"Leaping forward, she grasped her cousin's
arm and shook it."To witness the marriage, if it be a true one; to step between you
and shame if any element of falsehood should come in to affect its
legality."Mary's hand fell from her cousin's arm."I do not understand you,"
said she."I thought you never gave countenance to what you considered
wrong.""Nor do I. Any one who knows me will understand that I do not give my
approval to this marriage just because I attend its ceremonial in the
capacity of an unwilling witness.""Because I value your honor above my own peace.Because I love our
common benefactor, and know that he would never pardon me if I let his
darling be married, however contrary her union might be to his wishes,
without lending the support of my presence to make the transaction at
least a respectable one.""But in so doing you will be involved in a world of deception--which you
hate."Clavering does not return with me, Eleanore."Mary's face crimsoned, and she turned slowly away."What every other girl does under such circumstances, I suppose.The
development of more reasonable feelings in an obdurate parent's heart."Eleanore sighed, and a short silence ensued, broken by Eleanore's
suddenly falling upon her knees, and clasping her cousin's hand."Oh,
Mary," she sobbed, her haughtiness all disappearing in a gush of wild
entreaty, "consider what you are doing!Think, before it is too late, of
the consequences which must follow such an act as this.Marriage founded
upon deception can never lead to happiness.Love would have led you either to have dismissed Mr.Clavering at once,
or to have openly accepted the fate which a union with him would bring.Only passion stoops to subterfuge like this.And you," she continued,
rising and turning toward me in a sort of forlorn hope very touching
to see, "can you see this young motherless girl, driven by caprice, and
acknowledging no moral restraint, enter upon the dark and crooked path
she is planning for herself, without uttering one word of warning and
appeal?Tell me, mother of children dead and buried, what excuse you
will have for your own part in this day's work, when she, with her
face marred by the sorrows which must follow this deception, comes to
you----"

"The same excuse, probably," Mary's voice broke in, chill and strained,
"which you will have when uncle inquires how you came to allow such an
act of disobedience to be perpetrated in his absence: that she could not
help herself, that Mary would gang her ain gait, and every one around
must accommodate themselves to it."It was like a draught of icy air suddenly poured into a room heated up
to fever point.Eleanore stiffened immediately, and drawing back, pale
and composed, turned upon her cousin with the remark:

"Then nothing can move you?"The curling of Mary's lips was her only reply.Raymond, I do not wish to weary you with my feelings, but the first
great distrust I ever felt of my wisdom in pushing this matter so far
came with that curl of Mary's lip.More plainly than Eleanore's words it
showed me the temper with which she was entering upon this undertaking;
and, struck with momentary dismay, I advanced to speak when Mary stopped
me."There, now, Mamma Hubbard, don't you go and acknowledge that you
are frightened, for I won't hear it.I have promised to marry Henry
Clavering to-day, and I am going to keep my word--if I don't love him,"
she added with bitter emphasis.Then, smiling upon me in a way which
caused me to forget everything save the fact that she was going to her
bridal, she handed me her veil to fasten.As I was doing this, with very
trembling fingers, she said, looking straight at Eleanore:

"You have shown yourself more interested in my fate than I had any
reason to expect.Will you continue to display this concern all the way
to F----, or may I hope for a few moments of peace in which to dream
upon the step which, according to you, is about to hurl upon me such
dreadful consequences?""If I go with you to F----," Eleanore returned, "it is as a witness, no
more."Very well, then," Mary said, dimpling with sudden gayety; "I suppose
I shall have to accept the situation.Mamma Hubbard, I am so sorry to
disappoint you, but the buggy _won't_ hold three.If you are good you
shall be the first to congratulate me when I come home to-night."And,
almost before I knew it, the two had taken their seats in the buggy that
was waiting at the door."Good-by," cried Mary, waving her hand from the
back; "wish me much joy--of my ride."I tried to do so, but the words wouldn't come.I could only wave my hand
in response, and rush sobbing into the house.Of that day, and its long hours of alternate remorse and anxiety, I
cannot trust myself to speak.Let me come at once to the time when,
seated alone in my lamp-lighted room, I waited and watched for the token
of their return which Mary had promised me.It came in the shape of Mary
herself, who, wrapped in her long cloak, and with her beautiful face
aglow with blushes, came stealing into the house just as I was beginning
to despair.A strain of wild music from the hotel porch, where they were having a
dance, entered with her, producing such a weird effect upon my fancy
that I was not at all surprised when, in flinging off her cloak, she
displayed garments of bridal white and a head crowned with snowy roses.I cried, bursting into tears; "you are then----"

"Mrs."Without a bridal," I murmured, taking her passionately into my embrace.Nestling close to me, she gave
herself up for one wild moment to a genuine burst of tears, saying
between her sobs all manner of tender things; telling me how she loved
me, and how I was the only one in all the world to whom she dared come
on this, her wedding night, for comfort or congratulation, and of how
frightened she felt now it was all over, as if with her name she had
parted with something of inestimable value."And does not the thought of having made some one the proudest of men
solace you?"I asked, more than dismayed at this failure of mine to make
these lovers happy."I don't know," she sobbed."What satisfaction can it be for him to
feel himself tied for life to a girl who, sooner than lose a prospective
fortune, subjected him to such a parting?""Tell me about it," said I.

But she was not in the mood at that moment.The excitement of the day
had been too much for her.A thousand fears seemed to beset her mind.Crouching down on the stool at my feet, she sat with her hands folded
and a glare on her face that lent an aspect of strange unreality to her
brilliant attire.The thought haunts me
every moment; how can I keep it secret!""Why, is there any danger of its being known?""It all went off well, but----"

"Where is the danger, then?""I cannot say; but some deeds are like ghosts.They will not be laid;
they reappear; they gibber; they make themselves known whether we will
or not.I was mad, reckless, what you
will.But ever since the night has come, I have felt it crushing upon me
like a pall that smothers life and youth and love out of my heart.While
the sunlight remained I could endure it; but now--oh, Auntie, I have
done something that will keep me in constant fear.I have allied myself
to a living apprehension."For two hours I have played at being gay.Dressed in my bridal white,
and crowned with roses, I have greeted my friends as if they were
wedding-guests, and made believe to myself that all the compliments
bestowed upon me--and they are only too numerous--were just so many
congratulations upon my marriage.But it was no use; Eleanore knew it
was no use.She has gone to her room to pray, while I--I have come here
for the first time, perhaps for the last, to fall at some one's feet and
cry,--' God have mercy upon me!'""Oh, Mary, have I only
succeeded, then, in making you miserable?"She did not answer; she was engaged in picking up the crown of roses
which had fallen from her hair to the floor."If I had not been taught to love money so!""If,
like Eleanore, I could look upon the splendor which has been ours from
childhood as a mere accessory of life, easy to be dropped at the call of
duty or affection!If prestige, adulation, and elegant belongings were
not so much to me; or love, friendship, and domestic happiness more!If only I could walk a step without dragging the chain of a thousand
luxurious longings after me.Imperious as she often is in
her beautiful womanhood, haughty as she can be when the delicate quick
of her personality is touched too rudely, I have known her to sit by the
hour in a low, chilly, ill-lighted and ill-smelling garret, cradling a
dirty child on her knee, and feeding with her own hand an impatient old
woman whom no one else would consent to touch.they talk about
repentance and a change of heart!If some one or something would only
change mine!no hope of my ever being
anything else than what I am: a selfish, wilful, mercenary girl."Nor was this mood a mere transitory one.That same night she made a
discovery which increased her apprehension almost to terror.This was
nothing less than the fact that Eleanore had been keeping a diary of
the last few weeks."Oh," she cried in relating this to me the next day,
"what security shall I ever feel as long as this diary of hers remains
to confront me every time I go into her room?And she will not consent
to destroy it, though I have done my best to show her that it is a
betrayal of the trust I reposed in her.She says it is all she has to
show in the way of defence, if uncle should ever accuse her of treachery
to him and his happiness.She promises to keep it locked up; but what
good will that do!A thousand accidents might happen, any of them
sufficient to throw it into uncle's hands.I shall never feel safe for a
moment while it exists."I endeavored to calm her by saying that if Eleanore was without malice,
such fears were groundless.But she would not be comforted, and seeing
her so wrought up, I suggested that Eleanore should be asked to trust it
into my keeping till such time as she should feel the necessity of using
it."O yes," she cried; "and I will
put my certificate with it, and so get rid of all my care at once."And before the afternoon was over, she had seen Eleanore and made her
request.It was acceded to with this proviso, that I was neither to destroy nor
give up all or any of the papers except upon their united demand.A
small tin box was accordingly procured, into which were put all the
proofs of Mary's marriage then existing, viz.Clavering's letters, and such leaves from Eleanore's diary as referred
to this matter.It was then handed over to me with the stipulation
I have already mentioned, and I stowed it away in a certain closet
upstairs, where it has lain undisturbed till last night.Belden paused, and, blushing painfully, raised her eyes to
mine with a look in which anxiety and entreaty were curiously blended."I don't know what you will say," she began, "but, led away by my
fears, I took that box out of its hiding-place last evening and,
notwithstanding your advice, carried it from the house, and it is
now----"

"In my possession," I quietly finished.I don't think I ever saw her look more astounded, not even when I told
her of Hannah's death."I left it last
night in the old barn that was burned down.I merely meant to hide it
for the present, and could think of no better place in my hurry; for the
barn is said to be haunted--a man hung himself there once--and no one
ever goes there.she cried, "unless----"

"Unless I found and brought it away before the barn was destroyed," I
suggested."Yes," said I. Then, as I felt my own countenance redden, hastened to
add: "We have been playing strange and unaccustomed parts, you and I.
Some time, when all these dreadful events shall be a mere dream of the
past, we will ask each other's pardon.The
box is safe, and I am anxious to hear the rest of your story."This seemed to compose her, and after a minute she continued:

Mary seemed more like herself after this.Leavenworth's return and their subsequent preparations for departure,
I saw but little more of her, what I did see was enough to make me
fear that, with the locking up of the proofs of her marriage, she was
indulging the idea that the marriage itself had become void.But I may
have wronged her in this.The story of those few weeks is almost finished.On the eve of the day
before she left, Mary came to my house to bid me good-by.She had a
present in her hand the value of which I will not state, as I did not
take it, though she coaxed me with all her prettiest wiles.But she said
something that night that I have never been able to forget.I had been speaking of my hope that before two months had elapsed she
would find herself in a position to send for Mr.Clavering, and that
when that day came I should wish to be advised of it; when she suddenly
interrupted me by saying:

"Uncle will never be won upon, as you call it, while he lives.If I was
convinced of it before, I am sure of it now.Nothing but his death will
ever make it possible for me to send for Mr.Then, seeing
me look aghast at the long period of separation which this seemed to
betoken, blushed a little and whispered: "The prospect looks somewhat
dubious, doesn't it?"But," said I, "your uncle is only little past the prime of life and
appears to be in robust health; it will be years of waiting, Mary.""I don't know," she muttered, "I think not.Uncle is not as strong as he
looks and--" She did not say any more, horrified perhaps at the turn the
conversation was taking.But there was an expression on her countenance
that set me thinking at the time, and has kept me thinking ever since.Not that any actual dread of such an occurrence as has since happened
came to oppress my solitude during the long months which now intervened.I was as yet too much under the spell of her charm to allow anything
calculated to throw a shadow over her image to remain long in my
thoughts.But when, some time in the fall, a letter came to me
personally from Mr.Clavering, filled with a vivid appeal to tell
him something of the woman who, in spite of her vows, doomed him to a
suspense so cruel, and when, on the evening of the same day, a friend
of mine who had just returned from New York spoke of meeting Mary
Leavenworth at some gathering, surrounded by manifest admirers, I began
to realize the alarming features of the affair, and, sitting down, I
wrote her a letter.Not in the strain in which I had been accustomed to
talk to her,--I had not her pleading eyes and trembling, caressing hands
ever before me to beguile my judgment from its proper exercise,--but
honestly and earnestly, telling her how Mr.Clavering felt, and what a
risk she ran in keeping so ardent a lover from his rights.Robbins out of my calculations for the present, and
advise you to do the same.As for the gentleman himself, I have told him
that when I could receive him I would be careful to notify him."But do not let him be discouraged," she added in a postscript."When he
does receive his happiness, it will be a satisfying one."Ah, it is that _when_ which is likely to ruin all!But, intent only upon fulfilling her will, I sat down and wrote a letter
to Mr.Clavering, in which I stated what she had said, and begged him
to have patience, adding that I would surely let him know if any change
took place in Mary or her circumstances.And, having despatched it to
his address in London, awaited the development of events.In two weeks I heard of the sudden
death of Mr.Stebbins, the minister who had married them; and while
yet laboring under the agitation produced by this shock, was further
startled by seeing in a New York paper the name of Mr.Clavering among
the list of arrivals at the Hoffman House; showing that my letter to
him had failed in its intended effect, and that the patience Mary had
calculated upon so blindly was verging to its end.I was consequently
far from being surprised when, in a couple of weeks or so afterwards,
a letter came from him to my address, which, owing to the careless
omission of the private mark upon the envelope, I opened, and read
enough to learn that, driven to desperation by the constant failures
which he had experienced in all his endeavors to gain access to her in
public or private, a failure which he was not backward in ascribing
to her indisposition to see him, he had made up his mind to risk
everything, even her displeasure; and, by making an appeal to her uncle,
end the suspense under which he was laboring, definitely and at once."I
want you," he wrote; "dowered or dowerless, it makes little difference
to me.If you will not come of yourself, then I must follow the example
of the brave knights, my ancestors; storm the castle that holds you, and
carry you off by force of arms."Neither can I say I was much surprised, knowing Mary as I did, when, in
a few days from this, she forwarded to me for copying, this reply: "If
Mr.Robbins ever expects to be happy with Amy Belden, let him reconsider
the determination of which he speaks.Not only would he by such an
action succeed in destroying the happiness of her he professes to love,
but run the greater risk of effectually annulling the affection which
makes the tie between them endurable."It was the cry of warning
which a spirited, self-contained creature gives when brought to bay.It
made even me recoil, though I had known from the first that her pretty
wilfulness was but the tossing foam floating above the soundless depths
of cold resolve and most deliberate purpose.What its real effect was upon him and her fate I can only conjecture.All I know is that in two weeks thereafter Mr.Leavenworth was found
murdered in his room, and Hannah Chester, coming direct to my door from
the scene of violence, begged me to take her in and secrete her from
public inquiry, as I loved and desired to serve Mary Leavenworth.UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room.It was
broken by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just
mentioned, it being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found
entrance into her house without the knowledge of the neighbors."Well," said she, "it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early
(I was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to
one--the last train goes through R---- at 12.50--there came a low knock
on the window-pane at the head of my bed.Thinking that some of the
neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who
was there.The answer came in low, muffled tones, 'Hannah, Miss
Leavenworth's girl!Startled at
hearing the well-known voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up
a lamp and hurried round to the door.But no sooner had she done so than
my strength failed me, and I had to sit down, for I saw she looked very
pale and strange, was without baggage, and altogether had the appearance
of some wandering spirit.what brings you here in this condition and at this time
of night?''Miss Leavenworth has sent me,' she replied, in the low,
monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by rote.'She told me to come
here; said you would keep me.I am not to go out of the house, and no
one is to know I am here.'I asked, trembling with a thousand
undefined fears; 'what has occurred?''I dare not say,' she whispered;
'I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep quiet.''But,' I began,
helping her to take off her shawl,--the dingy blanket advertised for
in the papers--'you must tell me.She surely did not forbid you to tell
_me?_' 'Yes she did; every one,' the girl replied, growing white in her
persistence, 'and I never break my word; fire couldn't draw it out
of me.'She looked so determined, so utterly unlike herself, as I
remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our old acquaintance,
that I could do nothing but stare at her.'You will keep me,' she said;
'you will not turn me away?''No,' I said, 'I will not turn you away.'Thanking me, she quietly followed me
up-stairs.I put her into the room in which you found her, because it
was the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever
since, satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very
same horrible day.""Did you have no explanation with her
afterwards?Did she never give you any information in regard to the
transactions which led to her flight?"Neither then nor when,
upon the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the
awful question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned
by the murder which had taken place in Mr.Leavenworth's household, did
she do more than acknowledge she had run away on this account.Some one
or something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, 'Fire and torture
should never make her speak.'"Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering
about the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:

"This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
Leavenworth's secret marriage and the great strait it put her
into--a strait from which nothing but her uncle's death could relieve
her--together with this acknowledgment of Hannah's that she had left
home and taken refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the
groundwork you have for the suspicions you have mentioned?""Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is
given by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you
have now in your possession."Belden went on in a broken voice, "that it is wrong, in a
serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can
I help it, knowing what I do?"I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
Leavenworth's own hand guiltless of her uncle's blood?"It is dreadful to come to such conclusions," proceeded Mrs.Belden,
"and nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have
driven me to them, but----"

"Pardon me," I interrupted; "but you said in the beginning of this
interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in
her uncle's murder.Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing
it, I never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
performance.whatever was done on that dreadful night,
Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by
while they were used; that you may be sure of.Only the man who loved
her, longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any
other means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.""Then you think----"

"Mr.I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he
is her husband, is it not dreadful enough?""It is, indeed," said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by
this conclusion of hers.Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her."I hope and
trust I have not been indiscreet," she cried, eying me with something
like an incipient distrust."With this dead girl lying in my house, I
ought to be very careful, I know, but----"

"You have said nothing," was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere
that was stifling me."No one can blame you for anything you have
either said or done to-day.But"--and here I paused and walked hurriedly
back,--"I wish to ask one question more.Have you any reason, beyond
that of natural repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman
guilty of a great crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a
gentleman who has hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?""No," she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the
same sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key
had been found in Eleanore Leavenworth's possession."You must excuse
me," I said; "I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over
the facts which I have just heard; I will soon return "; and without
further ceremony, hurried from the room.By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs.The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but
its sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in
a fearful debate with myself.Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or
merely the accessory, in this crime?Gryce, the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of
such facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility
that Mrs.That all the detectives
interested in the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not
doubt; but need it be?Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet
that Henry Clavering was, after all, the assassin of Mr.Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where
lay the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known
the truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me.Oh, why could
not the dead be made to speak?Why should she lie there so silent, so
pulseless, so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the
awful question?Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side.With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted
my demanding gaze!A stone could not have been more unresponsive.With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when--what
was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
against the bed?Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter
out.Breaking it hastily open, I took
a glance at its contents.it was the work of the girl
herself!--its very appearance was enough to make that evident!Feeling
as if a miracle had happened, I hastened with it into the other room,
and set myself to decipher the awkward scrawl.This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a
sheet of common writing-paper:

"I am a wicked girl.I have knone things all the time which I had ought
to have told but I didn't dare to he said he would kill me if I did I
mene the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I
met coming out of Mister Levenworth's room with a key in his hand the
night Mr.He was so scared he gave me money and
made me go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can't do
so no longer.I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking
me if I want her sent to prisun.And this is
the truth and my last words and I pray every body's forgivness and hope
nobody will blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but
go and look after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash."THE PROBLEM SOLVED



XXXIV.GRYCE RESUMES CONTROL


    "It out-herods Herod."--Richard III

A HALF-HOUR had passed.The train upon which I had every reason to
expect Mr.Gryce had arrived, and I stood in the doorway awaiting with
indescribable agitation the slow and labored approach of the motley
group of men and women whom I had observed leave the depot at the
departure of the cars.Was the telegram of a
nature peremptory enough to make his presence here, sick as he was, an
absolute certainty?The written confession of Hannah throbbing against
my heart, a heart all elation now, as but a short half-hour before it
had been all doubt and struggle, seemed to rustle distrust, and the
prospect of a long afternoon spent in impatience was rising before me,
when a portion of the advancing crowd turned off into a side street,
and I saw the form of Mr.Gryce hobbling, not on two sticks, but very
painfully on one, coming slowly down the street.His face, as he approached, was a study."Well, well, well," he exclaimed, as we met at the gate; "this is a
pretty how-dye-do, I must say.and everything turned
topsy-turvy!Humph, and what do you think of Mary Leavenworth now?"It would therefore seem natural, in the conversation which followed his
introduction into the house and installment in Mrs.Belden's parlor,
that I should begin my narration by showing him Hannah's confession; but
it was not so.Whether it was that I felt anxious to have him go through
the same alternations of hope and fear it had been my lot to experience
since I came to R----; or whether, in the depravity of human nature,
there lingered within me sufficient resentment for the persistent
disregard he had always paid to my suspicions of Henry Clavering to make
it a matter of moment to me to spring this knowledge upon him just at
the instant his own convictions seemed to have reached the point of
absolute certainty, I cannot say.Enough that it was not till I had
given him a full account of every other matter connected with my stay in
this house; not till I saw his eye beaming, and his lip quivering with
the excitement incident upon the perusal of the letter from Mary, found
in Mrs.Belden's pocket; not, indeed, until I became assured from such
expressions as "Tremendous!Nothing
like it since the Lafarge affair!"that in another moment he would be
uttering some theory or belief that once heard would forever stand like
a barrier between us, did I allow myself to hand him the letter I had
taken from under the dead body of Hannah.I shall never forget his expression as he received it; "Good heavens!"I found it lying in her bed when
I went up, a half-hour ago, to take a second look at her."Opening it, he glanced over it with an incredulous air that speedily,
however, turned to one of the utmost astonishment, as he hastily perused
it, and then stood turning it over and over in his hand, examining it."A remarkable piece of evidence," I observed, not without a certain
feeling of triumph; "quite changes the aspect of affairs!"he sharply retorted; then, whilst I stood staring at him in
amazement, his manner was so different from what I expected, looked up
and said: "You tell me that you found this in her bed."Under the body of the girl herself," I returned."I saw one corner of
it protruding from beneath her shoulders, and drew it out.""Was it folded or open, when you first
looked at it?""Folded; fastened up in this envelope," showing it to him.He took it, looked at it for a moment, and went on with his questions."This envelope has a very crumpled appearance, as well as the letter
itself."Yes, not only so, but doubled up as you see."Folded, sealed, and then doubled up
as if her body had rolled across it while alive?"No look as if the thing had been insinuated there
since her death?"I should rather say that to every appearance she held it in
her hand when she lay down, but turning over, dropped it and then laid
upon it."Gryce's eyes, which had been very bright, ominously clouded;
evidently he had been disappointed in my answers, paying the letter
down, he stood musing, but suddenly lifted it again, scrutinized the
edges of the paper on which it was written, and, darting me a quick
look, vanished with it into the shade of the window curtain.His manner
was so peculiar, I involuntarily rose to follow; but he waved me back,
saying:

"Amuse yourself with that box on the table, which you had such an ado
over; see if it contains all we have a right to expect to find in it.I
want to be by myself for a moment."Subduing my astonishment, I proceeded to comply with his request, but
scarcely had I lifted the lid of the box before me when he came hurrying
back, flung the letter down on the table with an air of the greatest
excitement, and cried:

"Did I say there had never been anything like it since the Lafarge
affair?I tell you there has never been anything like it in any affair.It is the rummest case on record!Raymond," and his eyes, in his
excitement, actually met mine for the first time in my experience of
him, "prepare yourself for a disappointment.This pretended confession
of Hannah's is a fraud!""Yes; fraud, forgery, what you will; the girl never wrote it."Amazed, outraged almost, I bounded from my chair.Bending forward, he put the letter into my hand."Look at it," said he;
"examine it closely.Now tell me what is the first thing you notice in
regard to it?""Why, the first thing that strikes me, is that the words are printed,
instead of written; something which might be expected from this girl,
according to all accounts.""That they are printed on the inside of a sheet of ordinary paper----"

"Ordinary paper?""That is, a sheet of commercial note of the ordinary quality.""Why, yes; I should say so."Oh, I see, they run up close to the top of the page;
evidently the scissors have been used here.""In short, it is a large sheet, trimmed down to the size of commercial
note?""Don't you perceive what has been lost by means of this trimming down?""No, unless you mean the manufacturer's stamp in the corner.""But I don't see why the loss of that
should be deemed a matter of any importance."Not when you consider that by it we seem to be deprived of
all opportunity of tracing this sheet back to the quire of paper from
which it was taken?"then you are more of an amateur than I thought you.Don't you
see that, as Hannah could have had no motive for concealing where the
paper came from on which she wrote her dying words, this sheet must have
been prepared by some one else?""No," said I; "I cannot say that I see all that."Why should Hannah, a girl about to
commit suicide, care whether any clue was furnished, in her confession,
to the actual desk, drawer, or quire of paper from which the sheet was
taken, on which she wrote it?""Yet especial pains have been taken to destroy that clue.""But----"

"Then there is another thing.Raymond,
and tell me what you gather from it.""Why," said I, after complying, "that the girl, worn out with constant
apprehension, has made up her mind to do away with herself, and that
Henry Clavering----"

"Henry Clavering?"The interrogation was put with so much meaning, I looked up."Ah, I didn't know that Mr.Clavering's name was mentioned there; excuse
me.""His name is not mentioned, but a description is given so strikingly in
accordance----"

Here Mr."Does it not seem a little surprising to
you that a girl like Hannah should have stopped to describe a man she
knew by name?"Belden's story, don't you?""Consider her accurate in her relation of what took place here a year
ago?""Must believe, then, that Hannah, the go-between, was acquainted with
Mr.If her intention was, as she here
professes, to save Eleanore Leavenworth from the false imputation which
had fallen upon her, she would naturally take the most direct method
of doing it.This description of a man whose identity she could have at
once put beyond a doubt by the mention of his name is the work, not of
a poor, ignorant girl, but of some person who, in attempting to play the
_role_ of one, has signally failed.Belden,
according to you, maintains that Hannah told her, upon entering the
house, that Mary Leavenworth sent her here.But in this document, she
declares it to have been the work of Black Mustache.""I know; but could they not have both been parties to the transaction?""Yes," said he; "yet it is always a suspicious circumstance, when there
is a discrepancy between the written and spoken declaration of a person.But why do we stand here fooling, when a few words from this Mrs.Belden, you talk so much about, will probably settle the whole matter!""I have had thousands
from her to-day, and find the matter no nearer settled than in the
beginning.""_You_ have had," said he, "but I have not."One thing," said I, "before I go.What if Hannah had found the
sheet of paper, trimmed just as it is, and used it without any thought
of the suspicions it would occasion!"said he, "that is just what we are going to find out."Belden was in a flutter of impatience when I entered the
sitting-room.and what did I
imagine this detective would do for us?It was dreadful waiting there
alone for something, she knew not what.I calmed her as well as I could, telling her the detective had not yet
informed me what he could do, having some questions to ask her first.Gryce, who in the short interim of my absence had altered his mood
from the severe to the beneficent, received Mrs.Belden with just that
show of respectful courtesy likely to impress a woman as dependent as
she upon the good opinion of others.and this is the lady in whose house this very disagreeable event
has occurred," he exclaimed, partly rising in his enthusiasm to greet
her."May I request you to sit," he asked; "if a stranger may be allowed
to take the liberty of inviting a lady to sit in her own house.""It does not seem like my own house any longer," said she, but in a sad,
rather than an aggressive tone; so much had his genial way imposed upon
her."Little better than a prisoner here, go and come, keep silence or
speak, just as I am bidden; and all because an unhappy creature, whom
I took in for the most unselfish of motives, has chanced to die in my
house!"This sudden death
ought to be easily explained.You say you had no poison in the house?""And that no one has ever been here to see her?""So that she could not have procured any such thing if she had wished?""Unless," he added suavely, "she had it with her when she came here?"She brought no baggage; and as for her
pocket, I know everything there was in it, for I looked.""Some money in bills, more than you would have expected such a girl to
have, some loose pennies, and a common handkerchief.""Well, then, it is proved the girl didn't die of poison, there being
none in the house."He said this in so convinced a tone she was deceived."That is just what I have been telling Mr.Raymond," giving me a
triumphant look."Must have been heart disease," he went on, "You say she was well
yesterday?""I did not say that; she was, sir, very.""What, ma'am, this girl?"I
should think her anxiety about those she had left behind her in the city
would have been enough to keep her from being very cheerful."Belden; "but it wasn't so.On the
contrary, she never seemed to worry about them at all."not about Miss Eleanore, who, according to the papers, stands
in so cruel a position before the world?But perhaps she didn't know
anything about that--Miss Leavenworth's position, I mean?""Yes, she did, for I told her.I was so astonished I could not keep
it to myself.You see, I had always considered Eleanore as one above
reproach, and it so shocked me to see her name mentioned in the
newspaper in such a connection, that I went to Hannah and read the
article aloud, and watched her face to see how she took it."She looked as if she didn't understand; asked me why I
read such things to her, and told me she didn't want to hear any more;
that I had promised not to trouble her about this murder, and that if I
continued to do so she wouldn't listen."She put her hand over her ears and frowned in such a
sullen way I left the room.""She has, however, mentioned the subject since?"not asked what they were going to do with her mistress?""She has shown, however, that something was preying on her mind--fear,
remorse, or anxiety?""No, sir; on the contrary, she has oftener appeared like one secretly
elated."Gryce, with another sidelong look at me, "that was
very strange and unnatural.I used to try to explain it by thinking her sensibilities
had been blunted, or that she was too ignorant to comprehend the
seriousness of what had happened; but as I learned to know her better,
I gradually changed my mind.There was too much method in her gayety for
that.I could not help seeing she had some future before her for which
she was preparing herself.As, for instance, she asked me one day if I
thought she could learn to play on the piano.And I finally came to the
conclusion she had been promised money if she kept the secret intrusted
to her, and was so pleased with the prospect that she forgot the
dreadful past, and all connected with it.At all events, that was the
only explanation I could find for her general industry and desire to
improve herself, or for the complacent smiles I detected now and then
stealing over her face when she didn't know I was looking."Not such a smile as crept over the countenance of Mr.Gryce at that
moment, I warrant.Belden, "which made her death such a
shock to me.I couldn't believe that so cheerful and healthy a creature
could die like that, all in one night, without anybody knowing anything
about it.But----"

"Wait one moment," Mr."You speak of her endeavors
to improve herself."Her desire to learn things she didn't know; as, for instance, to write
and read writing.She could only clumsily print when she came here."Gryce would take a piece out of my arm, he griped it so.Do you mean to say that since she has been with you
she has learned to write?""Yes, sir; I used to set her copies and----"

"Where are these copies?"Gryce, subduing his voice to its
most professional tone.I'd like
to see some of them.I always made it a point to destroy them as soon as
they had answered their purpose.I didn't like to have such things lying
around."Do," said he; "and I will go with you.I want to take a look at things
upstairs, any way."And, heedless of his rheumatic feet, he rose and
prepared to accompany her."This is getting very intense," I whispered, as he passed me.The smile he gave me in reply would have made the fortune of a Thespian
Mephistopheles.Of the ten minutes of suspense which I endured in their absence, I say
nothing.At the end of that time they returned with their hands full of
paper boxes, which they flung down on the table."The writing-paper of the household," observed Mr.Gryce; "every scrap
and half-sheet which could be found.But, before you examine it, look at
this."And he held out a sheet of bluish foolscap, on which were written
some dozen imitations of that time-worn copy, "BE GOOD AND YOU WILL
BE HAPPY"; with an occasional "_Beauty soon fades,"_ and "_Evil
communications corrupt good manners."_

"What do you think of that?"The only specimens of her writing to be found.Not much like some scrawls we have seen, eh?"Belden says this girl has known how to write as good as this for
more than a week.Took great pride in it, and was continually talking
about how smart she was."Leaning over, he whispered in my ear, "This
thing you have in your hand must have been scrawled some time ago, if
she did it."Then aloud: "But let us look at the paper she used to write
on."Dashing open the covers of the boxes on the table, he took out the loose
sheets lying inside, and scattered them out before me.One glance showed
they were all of an utterly different quality from that used in the
confession."This is all the paper in the house," said he.Belden, who stood in
a sort of maze before us."Wasn't there one stray sheet lying around
somewhere, foolscap or something like that, which she might have got
hold of and used without your knowing it?""No, sir; I don't think so.I had only these kinds; besides, Hannah had
a whole pile of paper like this in her room, and wouldn't have been apt
to go hunting round after any stray sheets.""But you don't know what a girl like that might do.Look at this one,"
said I, showing her the blank side of the confession."Couldn't a sheet
like this have come from somewhere about the house?Examine it well; the
matter is important.""I have, and I say, no, I never had a sheet of paper like that in my
house."Gryce advanced and took the confession from my hand.As he did so,
he whispered: "What do you think now?Many chances that Hannah got up
this precious document?"I shook my head, convinced at last; but in another moment turned to him
and whispered back: "But, if Hannah didn't write it, who did?And how
came it to be found where it was?""That," said he, "is just what is left for us to learn."And, beginning
again, he put question after question concerning the girl's life in the
house, receiving answers which only tended to show that she could not
have brought the confession with her, much less received it from a
secret messenger.Belden's word, the mystery
seemed impenetrable, and I was beginning to despair of success, when Mr.Gryce, with an askance look at me, leaned towards Mrs.Belden and said:

"You received a letter from Miss Mary Leavenworth yesterday, I hear.""Now I want to ask you a question.Was the letter, as you see it, the
only contents of the envelope in which it came?Wasn't there one for
Hannah enclosed with it?"There was nothing in my letter for her; but she had a letter
herself yesterday.we both exclaimed; "and in the mail?""Yes; but it was not directed to her.It was"--casting me a look full of
despair, "directed to me.It was only by a certain mark in the corner of
the envelope that I knew----"

"Good heaven!"Why didn't you
speak of it before?What do you mean by allowing us to flounder about
here in the dark, when a glimpse at this letter might have set us right
at once?""I didn't think anything about it till this minute.I didn't know it was
of importance.I----"

But I couldn't restrain myself."No," said she; "I gave it to the girl yesterday; I haven't seen it
since."and I hastened
towards the door."You won't find it," said Mr.There
is nothing but a pile of burned paper in the corner.By the way, what
could that have been?"She hadn't anything to burn unless it was the
letter.""We will see about that," I muttered, hurrying upstairs and bringing
down the wash-bowl with its contents."If the letter was the one I saw
in your hand at the post-office, it was in a yellow envelope.""Yellow envelopes burn differently from white paper.I ought to be able
to tell the tinder made by a yellow envelope when I see it.Ah, the
letter has been destroyed; here is a piece of the envelope," and I drew
out of the heap of charred scraps a small bit less burnt than the rest,
and held it up."Then there is no use looking here for what the letter contained," said
Mr.Gryce, putting the wash-bowl aside."We will have to ask you, Mrs.It was directed to me, to be sure; but Hannah told
me, when she first requested me to teach her how to write, that she
expected such a letter, so I didn't open it when it came, but gave it to
her just as it was.""You, however, stayed by to see her read it?""No, sir; I was in too much of a flurry.Raymond had just come and I
had no time to think of her.My own letter, too, was troubling me.""But you surely asked her some questions about it before the day was
out?""Yes, sir, when I went up with her tea things; but she had nothing
to say.Hannah could be as reticent as any one I ever knew, when she
pleased.She didn't even admit it was from her mistress."then you thought it was from Miss Leavenworth?""Why, yes, sir; what else was I to think, seeing that mark in the
corner?Though, to be sure, it might have been put there by Mr."You say she was cheerful yesterday; was she so after receiving this
letter?""Yes, sir; as far as I could see.I wasn't with her long; the necessity
I felt of doing something with the box in my charge--but perhaps Mr."It was an exhausting evening, and quite put Hannah out of my head,
but----"

"Wait!"Gryce, and beckoning me into a corner, he whispered,
"Now comes in that experience of Q's.While you are gone from the house,
and before Mrs.Belden sees Hannah again, he has a glimpse of the girl
bending over something in the corner of her room which may very fairly
be the wash-bowl we found there.After which, he sees her swallow, in
the most lively way, a dose of something from a bit of paper."Very well, then," he cried, going back to Mrs."But----"

"But when I went upstairs to bed, I thought of the girl, and going to
her door opened it.The light was extinguished, and she seemed asleep,
so I closed it again and came out.""In something of the same position in which she was found this morning?""And that is all you can tell us, either of her letter or her mysterious
death?"Belden," said he, "you know Mr.Clavering's handwriting when _you_
see it?""Now, which of the two was upon the envelope of the letter you gave
Hannah?"It was a disguised handwriting and might have been that
of either; but I think----"

"Well?""That it was more like hers than his, though it wasn't like hers
either."Gryce enclosed the confession in his hand in the
envelope in which it had been found."You remember how large the letter
was which you gave her?""Oh, it was large, very large; one of the largest sort.""O yes; thick enough for two letters.""Large enough and thick enough to contain this?"laying the confession,
folded and enveloped as it was, before her."Yes, sir," giving it a look of startled amazement, "large enough and
thick enough to contain that."Gryce's eyes, bright as diamonds, flashed around the room, and
finally settled upon a fly traversing my coat-sleeve."Do you need to
ask now," he whispered, in a low voice, "where, and from whom, this
so-called confession comes?"He allowed himself one moment of silent triumph, then rising, began
folding the papers on the table and putting them in his pocket.He took me by the arm and led me across the hall into toe sitting-room."I am going back to New York, I am going to pursue this matter.I am
going to find out from whom came the poison which killed this girl, and
by whose hand this vile forgery of a confession was written.""But," said I, rather thrown off my balance by all this, "Q and the
coroner will be here presently, won't you wait to see them?""No; clues such as are given here must be followed while the trail is
hot; I can't afford to wait.""If I am not mistaken, they have already come," I remarked, as a
tramping of feet without announced that some one stood at the door."That is so," he assented, hastening to let them in.Judging from common experience, we had every reason to fear that an
immediate stop would be put to all proceedings on our part, as soon as
the coroner was introduced upon the scene.But happily for us and the
interest at stake, Dr.Fink, of R ----, proved to be a very sensible
man.He had only to hear a true story of the affair to recognize at
once its importance and the necessity of the most cautious action in
the matter.Further, by a sort of sympathy with Mr.Gryce, all the more
remarkable that he had never seen him before, he expressed himself
as willing to enter into our plans, offering not only to allow us the
temporary use of such papers as we desired, but even undertaking to
conduct the necessary formalities of calling a jury and instituting
an inquest in such a way as to give us time for the investigations we
proposed to make.Gryce was enabled to take the 6:30
train for New York, and I to follow on the 10 p.m.,--the calling of a
jury, ordering of an autopsy, and final adjournment of the inquiry till
the following Tuesday, having all taken place in the interim.FINE WORK


    "No hinge nor loop
     To hang a doubt on!""But yet the pity of it, Iago!Oh, Iago, the pity of it, Iago."Gryce before leaving R---- prepared me for
his next move."The clue to this murder is supplied by the paper on which the
confession is written.Find from whose desk or portfolio this especial
sheet was taken, and you find the double murderer," he had said.Consequently, I was not surprised when, upon visiting his house, early
the next morning, I beheld him seated before a table on which lay
a lady's writing-desk and a pile of paper, till told the desk was
Eleanore's."What," said I, "are you not
satisfied yet of her innocence?""O yes; but one must be thorough.No conclusion is valuable which is not
preceded by a full and complete investigation.Why," he cried, casting
his eyes complacently towards the fire-tongs, "I have even been
rummaging through Mr.Clavering's effects, though the confession bears
the proof upon its face that it could not have been written by him.It
is not enough to look for evidence where you expect to find it.You must
sometimes search for it where you don't.Now," said he, drawing the desk
before him, "I don't anticipate finding anything here of a criminating
character; but it is among the possibilities that I may; and that is
enough for a detective.""Did you see Miss Leavenworth this morning?"I asked, as he proceeded
to fulfil his intention by emptying the contents of the desk upon the
table."Yes; I was unable to procure what I desired without it.And she behaved
very handsomely, gave me the desk with her own hands, and never raised
an objection.To be sure, she had little idea what I was looking for;
thought, perhaps, I wanted to make sure it did not contain the letter
about which so much has been said.But it would have made but little
difference if she had known the truth.This desk contains nothing _we_
want.""Was she well; and had she heard of Hannah's sudden death?"I asked, in
my irrepressible anxiety."Yes, and feels it, as you might expect her to.But let us see what we
have here," said he, pushing aside the desk, and drawing towards him the
stack of paper I have already referred to."I found this pile, just as
you see it, in a drawer of the library table at Miss Mary Leavenworth's
house in Fifth Avenue.If I am not mistaken, it will supply us with the
clue we want.""But----"

"But this paper is square, while that of the confession is of the size
and shape of commercial note?I know; but you remember the sheet used in
the confession was trimmed down.Taking the confession from his pocket and the sheet from the pile before
him, he carefully compared them, then held them out for my inspection.A
glance showed them to be alike in color."Hold them up to the light," said he.I did so; the appearance presented by both was precisely alike.And, laying them both down on the
table, he placed the edges of the two sheets together.The lines on the
one accommodated themselves to the lines on the other; and that question
was decided."I was convinced of it," said he."From the
moment I pulled open that drawer and saw this mass of paper, I knew the
end was come.""But," I objected, in my old spirit of combativeness, "isn't there any
room for doubt?Every family on the
block might easily have specimens of it in their library.""It is letter size, and that has gone out.Leavenworth used it for his manuscript, or I doubt if it would have been
found in his library.But, if you are still incredulous, let us see what
can be done," and jumping up, he carried the confession to the window,
looked at it this way and that, and, finally discovering what he wanted,
came back and, laying it before me, pointed out one of the lines of
ruling which was markedly heavier than the rest, and another which was
so faint as to be almost undistinguishable."Defects like these often
run through a number of consecutive sheets," said he."If we could find
the identical half-quire from which this was taken, I might show you
proof that would dispel every doubt," and taking up the one that lay on
top, he rapidly counted the sheets."It might have
been taken from this one," said he; but, upon looking closely at the
ruling, he found it to be uniformly distinct.The remainder of the paper, some dozen or so half-quires, looked
undisturbed.Gryce tapped his fingers on the table and a frown
crossed his face."Such a pretty thing, if it could have been done!"Suddenly he took up the next half-quire."Count the
sheets," said he, thrusting it towards me, and himself lifting another."Go on with the rest," he cried.I counted the sheets in the next; twelve.He counted those in the one
following, and paused.He counted again, and quietly put them aside."I made a mistake," said
he.Taking another half-quire, he went
through with the same operation;--in vain.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he.Daniel went to the bathroom."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too
