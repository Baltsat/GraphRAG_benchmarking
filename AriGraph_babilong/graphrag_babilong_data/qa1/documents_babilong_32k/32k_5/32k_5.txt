and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.]Sandra journeyed to the hallway.[Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.Playing with paper dolls--that's the latest."Tillie sat down suddenly on one of the stiff chairs.Her lips were as
white as her face."I thought, when I saw you--"

"I was afraid you'd think that."Tillie's hands twisted nervously in her lap.Schwitter's eyes were fixed on the window, which looked back on the
McKee yard."That spiraea back there's not looking very good.If you'll save the
cigar butts around here and put them in water, and spray it, you'll kill
the lice.""I don't know why you come around bothering me," she said dully."I've
been getting along all right; now you come and upset everything."Schwitter rose and took a step toward her."Well, I'll tell you why I came.I ain't getting any
younger, am I?Time's going on, and I'm wanting you all the time.What've I got out of life, anyhow?"What's that got to do with me?""You're lonely, too, ain't you?"And, anyhow, there's always a crowd
here.""You can be lonely in a crowd, and I guess--is there any one around here
you like better than me?""We can talk our heads off and
not get anywhere.You've got a wife living, and, unless you intend to do
away with her, I guess that's all there is to it."Haven't you got a right to be happy?"She was quick of wit, and she read his tone as well as his words."You get out of here--and get out quick!"She had jumped to her feet; but he only looked at her with understanding
eyes."That's the way I thought of it at first.Maybe I've
just got used to the idea, but it doesn't seem so bad to me now.Here
are you, drudging for other people when you ought to have a place all
your own--and not gettin' younger any more than I am.Here's both of us
lonely.I'd be a good husband to you, Till--because, whatever it'd be in
law, I'd be your husband before God."Tillie cowered against the door, her eyes on his.Here before her,
embodied in this man, stood all that she had wanted and never had.He
meant a home, tenderness, children, perhaps.He turned away from the
look in her eyes and stared out of the front window."Them poplars out there ought to be taken away," he said heavily.Tillie found her voice at last:--

"I couldn't do it, Mr."Perhaps, if you got used to the idea--"

"What's that to do with the right and wrong of it?"It seems to
me that the Lord would make an exception of us if He knew the
circumstances.Perhaps, after you get used to the idea--What I thought
was like this.I've got a little farm about seven miles from the city
limits, and the tenant on it says that nearly every Sunday somebody
motors out from town and wants a chicken-and-waffle supper.There ain't
much in the nursery business anymore.These landscape fellows buy their
stuff direct, and the middleman's out.I've got a good orchard, and
there's a spring, so I could put running water in the house.I'd be good
to you, Tillie,--I swear it."Don't a man respect a woman that's got courage enough to give up
everything for him?"Tillie was crying softly into her apron.He put a work-hardened hand on
her head."It isn't as if I'd run around after women," he said."You're the only
one, since Maggie--" He drew a long breath."I'll give you time to think
it over.Suppose I stop in to-morrow morning.It doesn't commit you to
anything to talk it over."There had been no passion in the interview, and there was none in
the touch of his hand.He was not young, and the tragic loneliness of
approaching old age confronted him.He was trying to solve his problem
and Tillie's, and what he had found was no solution, but a compromise."To-morrow morning, then," he said quietly, and went out the door.All that hot August morning Tillie worked in a daze.McKee watched
her and said nothing.She interpreted the girl's white face and set lips
as the result of having had to dismiss Schwitter again, and looked for
time to bring peace, as it had done before.Le Moyne came late to his midday meal.For once, the mental anaesthesia
of endless figures had failed him.On his way home he had drawn his
small savings from the bank, and mailed them, in cash and registered, to
a back street in the slums of a distant city.He had done this before,
and always with a feeling of exaltation, as if, for a time at least,
the burden he carried was lightened.But to-day he experienced no
compensatory relief.Life was dull and stale to him, effort ineffectual.At thirty a man should look back with tenderness, forward with hope.K.
Le Moyne dared not look back, and had no desire to look ahead into empty
years.Although he ate little, the dining-room was empty when he finished.Usually he had some cheerful banter for Tillie, to which she responded
in kind.But, what with the heat and with heaviness of spirit, he did
not notice her depression until he rose."Why, you're not sick, are you, Tillie?"If I send you two tickets to a
roof garden where there's a variety show, can't you take a friend and go
to-night?""Thanks; I guess I'll not go out."Then, unexpectedly, she bent her head against a chair-back and fell to
silent crying.Then:--

"Now--tell me about it.""I'm just worried; that's all.""Let's see if we can't fix up the worries."Then I'm the person to tell it to.I--I'm pretty much a lost soul
myself."He put an arm over her shoulders and drew her up, facing him."Suppose we go into the parlor and talk it out.I'll bet things are not
as bad as you imagine."But when, in the parlor that had seen Mr.Schwitter's strange proposal
of the morning, Tillie poured out her story, K."The wicked part is that I want to go with him," she finished."I keep
thinking about being out in the country, and him coming into supper, and
everything nice for him and me cleaned up and waiting--O my God!I've
always been a good woman until now.""I--I understand a great deal better than you think I do.The only thing is--"

"Go on."You might go on and be very happy.And as for the--for his wife, it
won't do her any harm.But when they come, and you cannot give
them a name--don't you see?God forbid that
I--But no happiness is built on a foundation of wrong.It's been tried
before, Tillie, and it doesn't pan out."He was conscious of a feeling of failure when he left her at last.She
had acquiesced in what he said, knew he was right, and even promised
to talk to him again before making a decision one way or the other.But
against his abstractions of conduct and morality there was pleading in
Tillie the hungry mother-heart; law and creed and early training were
fighting against the strongest instinct of the race.CHAPTER XI


The hot August days dragged on.Merciless sunlight beat in through the
slatted shutters of ward windows.At night, from the roof to which the
nurses retired after prayers for a breath of air, lower surrounding
roofs were seen to be covered with sleepers.Children dozed precariously
on the edge of eternity; men and women sprawled in the grotesque
postures of sleep.There was a sort of feverish irritability in the air.Even the nurses,
stoically unmindful of bodily discomfort, spoke curtly or not at all.Miss Dana, in Sidney's ward, went down with a low fever, and for a day
or so Sidney and Miss Grange got along as best they could.Sidney worked
like two or more, performed marvels of bed-making, learned to give
alcohol baths for fever with the maximum of result and the minimum
of time, even made rounds with a member of the staff and came through
creditably.Ed Wilson had sent a woman patient into the ward, and his visits
were the breath of life to the girl.Some of them will
try to take it out of you.It's been hot, and of course it's troublesome to tell
me everything.I--I think they're all very kind."He reached out a square, competent hand, and put it over hers."We miss you in the Street," he said."It's all sort of dead there since
you left.Joe Drummond doesn't moon up and down any more, for one thing.What was wrong between you and Joe, Sidney?""I didn't want to marry him; that's all."Then, seeing her face:--

"But you're right, of course.Don't marry anyone unless you can't live
without him.That's been my motto, and here I am, still single."During the lonely times when Max was at college and in Europe, he had
watched her grow from a child to a young girl.He did not suspect for
a moment that in that secret heart of hers he sat newly enthroned, in
a glow of white light, as Max's brother; that the mere thought that
he lived in Max's house (it was, of course Max's house to her), sat at
Max's breakfast table, could see him whenever he wished, made the touch
of his hand on hers a benediction and a caress.Sidney finished folding linen and went back to the ward.Almost every bed had its visitor beside it; but
Sidney, running an eye over the ward, found the girl of whom she had
spoken to Le Moyne quite alone.She was propped up in bed, reading; but
at each new step in the corridor hope would spring into her eyes and die
again.If these people would only get out and let me read
in peace--Say, sit down and talk to me, won't you?It beats the mischief
the way your friends forget you when you're laid up in a place like
this.""People can't always come at visiting hours."A girl I knew was sick here last year, and it wasn't too hot for me to
trot in twice a week with a bunch of flowers for her.Do you think she's
been here once?Then, suddenly:--

"You know that man I told you about the other day?""It was a shock to me, that's all.I didn't want you to think I'd break
my heart over any fellow.All I meant was, I wished he'd let me know."They looked unnaturally large and somber in
her face.Her hair had been cut short, and her nightgown, open at the
neck, showed her thin throat and prominent clavicles."You're from the city, aren't you, Miss Page?""You told me the street, but I've forgotten it."Sidney repeated the name of the Street, and slipped a fresh pillow under
the girl's head."The evening paper says there's a girl going to be married on your
street."A friend of mine is going to be married.I--I don't remember the man's name."I suppose you'll be going to that wedding?""If I ever get time to have a dress made, I'll surely go."Toward six o'clock the next morning, the night nurse was making out her
reports.On one record, which said at the top, "Grace Irving, age 19,"
and an address which, to the initiated, told all her story, the night
nurse wrote:--

"Did not sleep at all during night.Face set and eyes staring, but
complains of no pain.Carlotta Harrison, back from her vacation, reported for duty the next
morning, and was assigned to E ward, which was Sidney's.She gave Sidney
a curt little nod, and proceeded to change the entire routine with the
thoroughness of a Central American revolutionary president.Sidney, who
had yet to learn that with some people authority can only assert itself
by change, found herself confused, at sea, half resentful.Once she ventured a protest:--

"I've been taught to do it that way, Miss Harrison.If my method is
wrong, show me what you want, and I'll do my best.""I am not responsible for what you have been taught.And you will not
speak back when you are spoken to."Small as the incident was, it marked a change in Sidney's position
in the ward.She got the worst off-duty of the day, or none.Small
humiliations were hers: late meals, disagreeable duties, endless and
often unnecessary tasks.Even Miss Grange, now reduced to second place,
remonstrated with her senior."I think a certain amount of severity is good for a probationer," she
said, "but you are brutal, Miss Harrison."She's going to be one of the best nurses in
the house."Wilson's pet
probationer, that I don't always say 'please' when I ask her to change a
bed or take a temperature."Miss Grange was not lacking in keenness.She died not go to the Head,
which is unethical under any circumstances; but gradually there spread
through the training-school a story that Carlotta Harrison was jealous
of the new Page girl, Dr.Things were still highly
unpleasant in the ward, but they grew much better when Sidney was off
duty.She was asked to join a small class that was studying French at
night.As ignorant of the cause of her popularity as of the reason of
her persecution, she went steadily on her way.For the first time, she was facing problems and
demanding an answer.Why must there be Grace Irvings in the world?Why
must the healthy babies of the obstetric ward go out to the slums and
come back, in months or years, crippled for the great fight by the
handicap of their environment, rickety, tuberculous, twisted?Why need
the huge mills feed the hospitals daily with injured men?And there were other things that she thought of.Every night, on her
knees in the nurses' parlor at prayers, she promised, if she were
accepted as a nurse, to try never to become calloused, never to regard
her patients as "cases," never to allow the cleanliness and routine of
her ward to delay a cup of water to the thirsty, or her arms to a sick
child.On the whole, the world was good, she found.And, of all the good things
in it, the best was service.True, there were hot days and restless
nights, weary feet, and now and then a heartache.But to offset these there was the sound of Dr.Max's step
in the corridor, and his smiling nod from the door; there was a "God
bless you" now and then for the comfort she gave; there were wonderful
nights on the roof under the stars, until K.While Sidney watched the stars from her hospital roof, while all around
her the slum children, on other roofs, fought for the very breath of
life, others who knew and loved her watched the stars, too.K. was
having his own troubles in those days.Late at night, when Anna and
Harriet had retired, he sat on the balcony and thought of many things.He had noticed that her lips were rather blue,
and had called in Dr.Anna was not to
be told, or Sidney."Sidney can't help any," said Harriet, "and for Heaven's sake let her
have her chance.If you tell her anything at all, she'll have Sidney here, waiting on her
hand and foot."And Le Moyne, fearful of urging too much because his own heart was
crying out to have the girl back, assented.The boy did not seem to get over the
thing the way he should.Now and then Le Moyne, resuming his old habit
of wearying himself into sleep, would walk out into the country.On one
such night he had overtaken Joe, tramping along with his head down.Joe had not wanted his company, had plainly sulked."I'll not talk," he said; "but, since we're going the same way, we might
as well walk together."But after a time Joe had talked, after all.It was not much at first--a
feverish complaint about the heat, and that if there was trouble in
Mexico he thought he'd go."Wait until fall, if you're thinking of it," K. advised."This is tepid
compared with what you'll get down there.""I've got to get away from here."Since the scene at the White Springs Hotel,
both knew that no explanation was necessary."It isn't so much that I mind her turning me down," Joe said, after a
silence."A girl can't marry all the men who want her.But I don't
like this hospital idea.Sometimes"--he turned bloodshot eyes on Le Moyne--"I think she went
because she was crazy about somebody there.""She went because she wanted to be useful."For almost twenty minutes they tramped on without speech.They had made
a circle, and the lights of the city were close again.K. stopped and
put a kindly hand on Joe's shoulder."A man's got to stand up under a thing like this, you know.I mean, it
mustn't be a knockout."I'll tell you what's
eating me up," he exploded.Don't talk to me about her
going to the hospital to be useful.She's crazy about him, and he's as
crooked as a dog's hind leg."He felt immeasurably old beside Joe's boyish blustering--old and rather
helpless.Some of these days I'll get something on him.Then
she'll know what to think of her hero!""That's not quite square, is it?"Joe had left him then, wheeling abruptly off into the shadows.K. had
gone home alone, rather uneasy.There seemed to be mischief in the very
air.CHAPTER XII


Tillie was gone.Oddly enough, the last person to see her before she left was Harriet
Kennedy.Schwitter's visit, Harriet's 
maid had announced a visitor.She had taken expensive rooms
in a good location, and furnished them with the assistance of a decor
store.Then she arranged with a New York house to sell her models on
commission.Her short excursion to New York had marked for Harriet the beginning of
a new heaven and a new earth.Here, at last, she found people speaking
her own language.She ventured a suggestion to a manufacturer, and found
it greeted, not, after the manner of the Street, with scorn, but with
approval and some surprise."About once in ten years," said Mr.Arthurs, "we have a woman from out
of town bring us a suggestion that is both novel and practical.When we
find people like that, we watch them.They climb, madame,--climb."Harriet's climbing was not so rapid as to make her dizzy; but business
was coming.The first time she made a price of seventy-five dollars
for an evening gown, she went out immediately after and took a drink of
water.She began to learn little quips of the feminine mind: that a woman who
can pay seventy-five will pay double that sum; that it is not considered
good form to show surprise at a dressmaker's prices, no matter how high
they may be; that long mirrors and artificial light help sales--no woman
over thirty but was grateful for her pink-and-gray room with its soft
lights.She took a lesson
from the New York modistes, and wore trailing black gowns.She strapped
her thin figure into the best corset she could get, and had her black
hair marcelled and dressed high.And, because she was a lady by birth
and instinct, the result was not incongruous, but refined and rather
impressive.She took her business home with her at night, lay awake scheming, and
wakened at dawn to find fresh color combinations in the early sky.She
wakened early because she kept her head tied up in a towel, so that her
hair need be done only three times a week.That and the corset were the
penalties she paid.Her high-heeled shoes were a torment, too; but in
the work-room she kicked them off.To this new Harriet, then, came Tillie in her distress.Tillie was
rather overwhelmed at first.The Street had always considered Harriet
"proud."But Tillie's urgency was great, her methods direct.While she worked at the fingers of
her silk gloves, what Harriet took for nervousness was pure abstraction."It's very nice of you to come to see me.Tillie surveyed the rooms, and Harriet caught her first full view of her
face.If you have had any words--"

"It's not that.I'd like to talk to you, if you don't
mind.""I'm up against something, and I can't seem to make up my mind.Last
night I said to myself, 'I've got to talk to some woman who's not
married, like me, and not as young as she used to be.McKee: she's a widow, and wouldn't understand.'"Harriet's voice was a trifle sharp as she replied.She never lied about
her age, but she preferred to forget it."I wish you'd tell me what you're getting at.""It ain't the sort of thing to come to too sudden.You and I can pretend all we like, Miss Harriet; but we're not getting
all out of life that the Lord meant us to have.You've got them wax
figures instead of children, and I have mealers."A little spot of color came into Harriet's cheek.Regardless of the corset, she bent forward.Ten years more at the most, and I'm through.Can't get around the tables as I used to.Why, yesterday I
put sugar into Mr.Le Moyne's coffee--well, never mind about that.Now
I've got a chance to get a home, with a good man to look after me--I
like him pretty well, and he thinks a lot of me.""No'm," said Tillie; "that's it."The gray curtains with their pink cording swung gently in the open
windows.From the work-room came the distant hum of a sewing-machine and
the sound of voices.Harriet sat with her hands in her lap and listened
while Tillie poured out her story.She told it
all, consistently and with unconscious pathos: her little room under the
roof at Mrs.McKee's, and the house in the country; her loneliness,
and the loneliness of the man; even the faint stirrings of potential
motherhood, her empty arms, her advancing age--all this she knit into
the fabric of her story and laid at Harriet's feet, as the ancients put
their questions to their gods.Too much that Tillie poured out to her found
an echo in her own breast.What was this thing she was striving for but
a substitute for the real things of life--love and tenderness, children,
a home of her own?Quite suddenly she loathed the gray carpet on the
floor, the pink chairs, the shaded lamps.Tillie was no longer the
waitress at a cheap boarding-house.She loomed large, potential,
courageous, a woman who held life in her hands."She thinks any woman's a fool to take up with a man.""You're giving me a terrible responsibility, Tillie, if you're asking my
advice."I'm asking what you'd do if it happened to you.Suppose you had
no people that cared anything about you, nobody to disgrace, and all
your life nobody had really cared anything about you.And then a chance
like this came along."I don't know," said poor Harriet."It seems to me--I'm afraid I'd be
tempted.It does seem as if a woman had the right to be happy, even
if--"

Her own words frightened her.It was as if some hidden self, and not
she, had spoken.She hastened to point out the other side of the matter,
the insecurity of it, the disgrace.Like K., she insisted that no right
can be built out of a wrong.Tillie sat and smoothed her gloves.At
last, when Harriet paused in sheer panic, the girl rose."I know how you feel, and I don't want you to take the responsibility of
advising me," she said quietly."I guess my mind was made up anyhow.But
before I did it I just wanted to be sure that a decent woman would think
the way I do about it."And so, for a time, Tillie went out of the life of the Street as she
went out of Harriet's handsome rooms, quietly, unobtrusively, with calm
purpose in her eyes.The Lorenz house was being
painted for Christine's wedding.Johnny Rosenfeld, not perhaps of the
Street itself, but certainly pertaining to it, was learning to drive
Palmer Howe's new car, in mingled agony and bliss.He walked along the
Street, not "right foot, left foot," but "brake foot, clutch foot," and
took to calling off the vintage of passing cars."So-and-So 1910,"
he would say, with contempt in his voice.He spent more than he could
afford on a large streamer, meant to be fastened across the rear of the
automobile, which said, "Excuse our dust," and was inconsolable when
Palmer refused to let him use it.K. had yielded to Anna's insistence, and was boarding as well as
rooming at the Page house.The Street, rather snobbish to its occasional
floating population, was accepting and liking him.It found him tender,
infinitely human.And in return he found that this seemingly empty eddy
into which he had drifted was teeming with life.He busied himself with
small things, and found his outlook gradually less tinged with despair.When he found himself inclined to rail, he organized a baseball
club, and sent down to everlasting defeat the Linburgs, consisting of
cash-boys from Linden and Hofburg's department store.The Rosenfelds adored him, with the single exception of the head of
the family.The elder Rosenfeld having been "sent up," it was K. who
discovered that by having him consigned to the workhouse his family
would receive from the county some sixty-five cents a day for his labor.As this was exactly sixty-five cents a day more than he was worth to
them free, Mrs.Rosenfeld voiced the pious hope that he be kept there
forever.K. made no further attempt to avoid Max Wilson.Some day they would meet
face to face.He hoped, when it happened, they two might be alone; that
was all.Even had he not been bound by his promise to Sidney, flight
would have been foolish.The world was a small place, and, one way and
another, he had known many people.Wherever he went, there would be the
same chance.Other things being equal,--the eddy
and all that it meant--, he would not willingly take himself out of his
small share of Sidney's life.She was never to know what she meant to him, of course.He had scourged
his heart until it no longer shone in his eyes when he looked at her.But he was very human--not at all meek.There were plenty of days when
his philosophy lay in the dust and savage dogs of jealousy tore at it;
more than one evening when he threw himself face downward on the bed
and lay without moving for hours.And of these periods of despair he was
always heartily ashamed the next day.The meeting with Max Wilson took place early in September, and under
better circumstances than he could have hoped for.Sidney had come home for her weekly visit, and her mother's condition
had alarmed her for the first time.When Le Moyne came home at six
o'clock, he found her waiting for him in the hall."I am just a little frightened, K.," she said."Do you think mother is
looking quite well?""She has felt the heat, of course.The summer--I often think--"

"Her lips are blue!"She put her hands on his arm and looked up at him with appeal and
something of terror in her face.Thus cornered, he had to acknowledge that Anna had been out of sorts.It's tragic and absurd that I should be
caring for other people, when my own mother--"

She dropped her head on his arm, and he saw that she was crying.If he
made a gesture to draw her to him, she never knew it."I'm much braver than this in the hospital.K. was sorely tempted to tell her the truth and bring her back to the
little house: to their old evenings together, to seeing the younger
Wilson, not as the white god of the operating-room and the hospital, but
as the dandy of the Street and the neighbor of her childhood--back even
to Joe.But, with Anna's precarious health and Harriet's increasing engrossment
in her business, he felt it more and more necessary that Sidney go on
with her training.And there was another
point: it had been decided that Anna was not to know her condition.If
she was not worried she might live for years.There was no surer way to
make her suspect it than by bringing Sidney home.She insisted on coming downstairs, and
even sat with them on the balcony until the stars came out, talking
of Christine's trousseau, and, rather fretfully, of what she would do
without the parlors."You shall have your own boudoir upstairs," said Sidney valiantly."Katie can carry your tray up there.We are going to make the
sewing-room into your private sitting-room, and I shall nail the
machine-top down."When K. insisted on carrying her upstairs, she went in
a flutter.she said, when he had placed her on her bed."How can a clerk, bending over a ledger, be so muscular?When I have
callers, will it be all right for Katie to show them upstairs?"She dropped asleep before the doctor came; and when, at something after
eight, the door of the Wilson house slammed and a figure crossed the
street, it was not Ed at all, but the surgeon.Sidney had been talking rather more frankly than usual.Lately there
had been a reserve about her.K., listening intently that night, read
between words a story of small persecutions and jealousies.But the girl
minimized them, after her way."It's always hard for probationers," she said."I often think Miss
Harrison is trying my mettle."And now that Miss Gregg has said she will accept
me, it's really all over.The other nurses are wonderful--so kind and so
helpful.I hope I shall look well in my cap."A thousand contingencies
flashed through his mind.Sidney might grow to like her and bring her to
the house.Sidney might insist on the thing she always spoke of--that he
visit the hospital; and he would meet her, face to face.He could have
depended on a man to keep his secret.This girl with her somber eyes and
her threat to pay him out for what had happened to her--she meant danger
of a sort that no man could fight."Soon," said Sidney, through the warm darkness, "I shall have a cap,
and be always forgetting it and putting my hat on over it--the new ones
always do.One of the girls slept in hers the other night!They are
tulle, you know, and quite stiff, and it was the most erratic-looking
thing the next day!"It was then that the door across the street closed.Sidney did not
hear it, but K. bent forward.There was a part of his brain always
automatically on watch."I shall get my operating-room training, too," she went on."That is
the real romance of the hospital.A--a surgeon is a sort of hero in
a hospital.There was a lot of
excitement to-day.Even the probationers' table was talking about it.The figure across the Street was lighting a cigarette.Perhaps, after
all--

"Something tremendously difficult--I don't know what.Edwardes invented it, or whatever they
call it.They took a picture of the operating-room for the article.The photographer had to put on operating clothes and wrap the camera in
sterilized towels.It was the most thrilling thing, they say--"

Her voice died away as her eyes followed K.'s.Max, cigarette in
hand, was coming across, under the ailanthus tree.He hesitated on the
pavement, his eyes searching the shadowy balcony."My brother is not at home, so I came over.How select you are, with
your balcony!"K. had risen and pushed back his chair.Here in the darkness he could hold the situation for a moment.If he
could get Sidney into the house, the rest would not matter.Luckily, the
balcony was very dark.Le Moyne, and he knows who you are very
well, indeed."Didn't the Street beat the Linburgs
the other day?And I believe the Rosenfelds are in receipt of sixty-five
cents a day and considerable peace and quiet through you, Mr.You're the most popular man on the Street."Wilson is here to see
your mother--"

"Going," said Sidney.Wilson is a very great person, K., so be
polite to him."Max had roused at the sound of Le Moyne's voice, not to suspicion,
of course, but to memory.Without any apparent reason, he was back in
Berlin, tramping the country roads, and beside him--

"Wonderful night!""The mind's a curious thing, isn't it.In the
instant since Miss Page went through that window I've been to Berlin and
back!K. struck a match with his steady hands.Now that the thing had come, he
was glad to face it.In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the
night."Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin."Blackness had descended on them again, except
for the dull glow of K.The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the
curtains."Sidney will be back in a moment.I'll talk to you, if you'll
sit still."I've been here--in the city, I mean--for a year.Don't
forget it--Le Moyne.I've got a position in the gas office, clerical.I have reason to think I'm going to be moved
up.That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two."Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words.Only a part of what K.
said got to him.For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this
man across from him--it was not believable!"It's not hard work, and it's safe.If I make a mistake there's no life
hanging on it.Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago.It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket.Wilson's voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was
profoundly moved.When a year
went by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on
it--we gave up.I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college.I
went down for the--for the services.""Let it stay," said K. quietly."I'm dead as far as the college goes,
anyhow.And, for Heaven's sake,
don't be sorry for me.John went back to the bathroom.I'm more contented than I've been for a long
time."The wonder in Wilson's voice was giving way to irritation.Why, good Heavens, man, I did your
operation to-day, and I've been blowing about it ever since."When that
happened I gave up.All a man in our profession has is a certain method,
knowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself.I lost my
self-confidence; that's all.For about a year I was
damned sorry for myself."If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I've just told you I
did your operation to-day.There was just a chance for the man, and I
took my courage in my hands and tried it.K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail.Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown
of stars.Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men
he had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his
language, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze
tablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and
grave eyes.He heard--

He heard the soft rustle of Sidney's dress as she came into the little
room behind them.CHAPTER XIII


A few days after Wilson's recognition of K., two most exciting things
happened to Sidney.One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor
at her wedding.She was accepted, and
given her cap.Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house
had no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le
Moyne:

DEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute.I am as
conscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to
deserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall.I am writing
this on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It.I am
afraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means.Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward.I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and
turn all around and let them see it, without saying a word.You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible
this happiness of mine to-night.I am promising myself to be very good,
and not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now.Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor
Joe has both forgiven and forgotten.K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and
carried it upstairs to read.Whatever faint hope he might have had that
her youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over.With the
letter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty
years.But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her.He
surmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she
might come to care for him, his very presence in the little house
militated against him.There was none of the illusion of separation;
he was always there, like Katie.When she opened the door, she called
"Mother" from the hall.If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much
the same voice.He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson's
recognition and protest.But enduring philosophy comes only with time;
and he was young.Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a
passion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength.And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney's letter.Its very
frankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;
but he craved so much more.He threw himself face down on the bed, with
the paper crushed in his hand.Sidney's letter was not the only one he received that day.When, in
response to Katie's summons, he rose heavily and prepared for dinner, he
found an unopened envelope on the table.It was from Max Wilson:--

DEAR LE MOYNE,--I have been going around in a sort of haze all day.The
fact that I only heard your voice and scarcely saw you last night has
made the whole thing even more unreal.I have a feeling of delicacy about trying to see you again so soon.I'm
bound to respect your seclusion.But there are some things that have got
to be discussed.You said last night that things were "different" with you.Do you know any man in our
profession who has not?And, for fear you think I do not know what I am
talking about, the thing was threshed out at the State Society when the
question of the tablet came up.Old Barnes got up and said: "Gentlemen,
all of us live more or less in glass houses.Let him who is without
guilt among us throw the first stone!"I took my little car and drove around the
country roads, and the farther I went the more outrageous your position
became.I'm not going to write any rot about the world needing men like
you, although it's true enough.You working in
a gas office, while old O'Hara bungles and hacks, and I struggle along
on what I learned from you!It takes courage to step down from the pinnacle you stood on.So it's
not cowardice that has set you down here.The first, and best, is for you to go back.No one has taken your place, because no one could do the work.But if
that's out of the question,--and only you know that, for only you know
the facts,--the next best thing is this, and in all humility I make the
suggestion.Take the State exams under your present name, and when you've got your
certificate, come in with me.I'll be getting a
damn sight more than I give.It is a curious fact that a man who is absolutely untrustworthy about
women is often the soul of honor to other men.The younger Wilson,
taking his pleasures lightly and not too discriminatingly, was making an
offer that meant his ultimate eclipse, and doing it cheerfully, with his
eyes open.It was like Max to make such an offer, like him to make it
as if he were asking a favor and not conferring one.But the offer left
him untempted.He had weighed himself in the balance, and found himself
wanting.No tablet on the college wall could change that.And when,
late that night, Wilson found him on the balcony and added appeal to
argument, the situation remained unchanged.He realized its hopelessness
when K. lapsed into whimsical humor."I'm not absolutely useless where I am, you know, Max," he said."I've
raised three tomato plants and a family of kittens this summer, helped
to plan a trousseau, assisted in selecting wall-paper for the room just
inside,--did you notice it?--and developed a boy pitcher with a ball
that twists around the bat like a Colles fracture around a splint!""If you're going to be humorous--"

"My dear fellow," said K. quietly, "if I had no sense of humor, I should
go upstairs to-night, turn on the gas, and make a stertorous entrance
into eternity.By the way, that's something I forgot!"Among my other activities, I wired the parlor for
electric light.The bride-to-be expects some electroliers as wedding
gifts, and--"

Wilson rose and flung his cigarette into the grass.K. rose with him, and all the suppressed feeling of the interview was
crowded into his last few words."I'm not as ungrateful as you think, Max," he said."I--you've helped
a lot.I'm as well off as I deserve to be, and
better.Wilson's unexpected magnanimity put K. in a curious position--left him,
as it were, with a divided allegiance.Sidney's frank infatuation for
the young surgeon was growing.And where before
he might have felt justified in going to the length of warning her, now
his hands were tied.More than once he had
taken Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Le Moyne, handicapped at
every turn, found himself facing two alternatives, one but little better
than the other.The affair might run a legitimate course, ending in
marriage--a year of happiness for her, and then what marriage with
Max, as he knew him, would inevitably mean: wanderings away, remorseful
returns to her, infidelities, misery.Or, it might be less serious but
almost equally unhappy for her.Max might throw caution to the winds,
pursue her for a time,--K. had seen him do this,--and then, growing
tired, change to some new attraction.In either case, he could only wait
and watch, eating his heart out during the long evenings when Anna read
her "Daily Thoughts" upstairs and he sat alone with his pipe on the
balcony.Sidney went on night duty shortly after her acceptance.All of her
orderly young life had been divided into two parts: day, when one
played or worked, and night, when one slept.Now she was compelled to
a readjustment: one worked in the night and slept in the day.At the end of her first night report Sidney
added what she could remember of a little verse of Stevenson's.She
added it to the end of her general report, which was to the effect that
everything had been quiet during the night except the neighborhood."And does it not seem hard to you,
      When all the sky is clear and blue,
      And I should like so much to play,
      To have to go to bed by day?"The day assistant happened on the report, and was quite scandalized."If the night nurses are to spend their time making up poetry," she
said crossly, "we'd better change this hospital into a young ladies'
seminary.If she wants to complain about the noise in the street, she
should do so in proper form.""I don't think she made it up," said the Head, trying not to smile."I've heard something like it somewhere, and, what with the heat and the
noise of traffic, I don't see how any of them get any sleep."But, because discipline must be observed, she wrote on the slip the
assistant carried around: "Please submit night reports in prose."She tumbled into her low bed at nine o'clock
in the morning, those days, with her splendid hair neatly braided down
her back and her prayers said, and immediately her active young mind
filled with images--Christine's wedding, Dr.Max passing the door of her
old ward and she not there, Joe--even Tillie, whose story was now the
sensation of the Street.A few months before she would not have cared
to think of Tillie.She would have retired her into the land of
things-one-must-forget.But the Street's conventions were not holding
Sidney's thoughts now.She puzzled over Tillie a great deal, and over
Grace and her kind.On her first night on duty, a girl had been brought in from the Avenue.She had taken a poison--nobody knew just what.When the internes had
tried to find out, she had only said: "What's the use?"Sidney kept asking herself, "Why?"those mornings when she could not get
to sleep.People were kind--men were kind, really,--and yet, for some
reason or other, those things had to be.After a time Sidney would doze fitfully.But by three o'clock she was
always up and dressing.Lack of
sleep wrote hollows around her eyes and killed some of her bright color.Between three and four o'clock in the morning she was overwhelmed on
duty by a perfect madness of sleep.There was a penalty for sleeping on
duty.The old night watchman had a way of slipping up on one nodding.The night nurses wished they might fasten a bell on him!Luckily, at four came early-morning temperatures; that roused her.And
after that came the clatter of early milk-wagons and the rose hues of
dawn over the roofs.Twice in the night, once at supper and again toward
dawn, she drank strong black coffee.But after a week or two her nerves
were stretched taut as a string.Her station was in a small room close to her three wards.But she sat
very little, as a matter of fact.Her responsibility was heavy on her;
she made frequent rounds.The late summer nights were fitful, feverish;
the darkened wards stretched away like caverns from the dim light near
the door.And from out of these caverns came petulant voices, uneasy
movements, the banging of a cup on a bedside, which was the signal of
thirst.To them, perhaps just
a little weary with time and much service, the banging cup meant not so
much thirst as annoyance."Don't jump like that, child; they're not parched, you know.""But if you have a fever and are thirsty--"

"Thirsty nothing!"Then," Sidney would say, rising resolutely, "they are going to see me."Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself.They
liked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet
and tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service
had drained them dry.They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking
machines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that
their service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart.To them,
pain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written
on the tablets of her soul.Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night
service, as it was Sidney's first.She had
charge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the
ward into which all emergency cases were taken.It was a difficult
service, perhaps the most difficult in the house.Scarcely a night went
by without its patrol or ambulance case.Ordinarily, the emergency ward
had its own night nurse.Belated
vacations and illness had depleted the training-school.Carlotta, given
double duty, merely shrugged her shoulders."I've always had things pretty hard here," she commented briefly."When I go out, I'll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital
singlehanded, or I'll be carried out feet first."Sidney was glad to have her so near.She knew her better than she knew
the other nurses.Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding
her at a loss.Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a
soft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,
going out, would see Sidney's flushed face and slightly crooked cap
bending over the stair-rail."I'm dreadfully sorry to bother you," she would say, "but So-and-So
won't have a fever bath"; or, "I've a woman here who refuses her
medicine."Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers.Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never
occurred to her to refuse her assistance.Perhaps the angels who keep
the great record will put that to her credit.Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty.It was
the most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it
was quiet enough.So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.'s little watch
in hand, was not sure exactly when it happened.The light was very dim
behind the little screen.One moment the sheet was quivering slightly
under the struggle for breath, the next it was still.That life, so potential, so tremendous a
thing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate
always in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand
it.Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying.She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to
report--basins left about, errors on her records.She rinsed her
thermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending
him word that Mary McGuire's temperature was a hundred and ten degrees.She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go
airily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened!Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and
bringing the runaway back single-handed.For Christine's wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed
a wedding garment.In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the
details."An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!"Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz
house."And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!"Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and
recreation."Why do they ask 'em if they don't trust 'em?"But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate.It recalled to
him many things that were better forgotten.He rose and scowled at his
wife.Mary travelled to the bedroom."You tell Johnny something for me," he snarled."You tell him when he
sees his father walking down street, and he sittin' up there alone on
that automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him.Me
walking, while my son swells around in a car!"You let me hear of him road-housin', and
I'll kill him!"The wedding was to be at five o'clock.This, in itself, defied all
traditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early
morning at the Catholic church or at eight o'clock in the evening at
the Presbyterian.There was something reckless about five o'clock.It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a
marriage was not quite legal.The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one.Ed
resurrected an old black frock-coat and had a "V" of black cambric set
in the vest.Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a
new Panama to wear with it.The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at
McKees', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of
the excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered
himself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the
church.The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers.When the newspapers came
out with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that
Sidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the
hospital training-school.A probationer was authorized to find out
particulars.It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had
not been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory
Annex, drying her hair."I--I just wonder," she said, "if you would let some of the girls come
in to see you when you're dressed?""It's awfully thrilling, isn't it?"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?"They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not
there.The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set
to work with a fan at Sidney's hair."He's awfully good-looking, isn't he?"She was not ignorant of the methods of the school.If
this girl was pumping her--

"I'll have to think that over," she said, with a glint of mischief in
her eyes."When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether
he's good-looking or not.""I suppose," said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney's
hair through her fingers, "that when you are at home you see him often."Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by
the shoulders, faced her toward the door."You go back to the girls," she said, "and tell them to come in and see
me when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don't know whether I am to
walk down the aisle with Dr.She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind
her.That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison.Sidney must be very sure
of herself.She, too, had not slept during the day.When the probationer who
had brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white
night-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like
ceiling of her little room.She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the
church; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay
there, she knew that Max Wilson's eyes would be, not on the bride, but
on the girl who stood beside her.The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding
if she wanted to.She'd happened on a bit of information--many a wedding
had been stopped for less.It rather obsessed her to think of stopping
the wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle
together.There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish
activities of the previous month.In the Lorenz
kitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs.In the attic, in the center of a
sheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her
benefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride.All the second story
had been prepared for guests and presents.Florists were still busy in the room below.Bridesmaids were clustered
on the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and
calling reports to Christine through the closed door:--

"Another wooden box, Christine.What will you
ever do with them all?"Here's another of the neighbors who wants to see how you
look.Do say you can't have any visitors now."Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet.The bridesmaids had been
sternly forbidden to come into her room."I haven't had a chance to think for a month," she said."And I've got
some things I've got to think out."But, when Sidney came, she sent for her.Sidney found her sitting on a
stiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small
stand.And, after Sidney had kissed her:--

"I've a good mind not to do it.""You're tired and nervous, that's all."But that isn't what's wrong with me.Throw that veil
some place and sit down."Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch.Sidney thought
brides should be rather pale.But under her eyes were lines that Sidney
had never seen there before."I'm not going to be foolish, Sidney.I'll go through with it, of
course.It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.""Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night.Somebody called father up to-day and
said that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano.He hasn't
been here to-day."And as for the other--perhaps it wasn't Palmer who did
it."Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but
three months had made a change in Sidney.The complacent sophistries
of her girlhood no longer answered for truth.She put her arms around
Christine's shoulders."A man who drinks is a broken reed," said Christine."That's what I'm
going to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed.She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,
bolted the door.Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held
to Sidney a letter.It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--

Ask your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue.Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney.Christine, more sophisticated, had always known.Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was.The
paper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off.The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face
and cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her!One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside."Another electric lamp," she called excitedly through the door."You see," Christine said drearily."I have received another electric
lamp, and Palmer is downstairs!I've got to go through with it, I
suppose.The only difference between me and other brides is that I know
what I'm getting."It's too late to do anything else.I am not going to give this
neighborhood anything to talk about."She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head.Sidney stood
with the letter in her hands.'s answers to her hot question
had been this:--

"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead.What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what
she is going to be.""Even granting this to be true," she said to Christine slowly,--"and it
may only be malicious after all, Christine,--it's surely over and done
with.It's not Palmer's past that concerns you now; it's his future with
you, isn't it?"A band of duchesse lace rose
like a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of
her train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle.She arranged the coronet
carefully with small pearl-topped pins.Then she rose and put her hands
on Sidney's shoulders."The simple truth is," she said quietly, "that I might hold Palmer if
I cared--terribly.Daniel travelled to the hallway.It's my pride
that's hurt, nothing else."And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding.Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held.Already, in
her new philosophy, she had learned many strange things.One of them was
this: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the
code of the underworld was "death to the squealer"; that one played the
game, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine.Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course.Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set
fire to it with a match.Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes.The alley, however, was
rather confused by certain things.For instance, it regarded the awning
as essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck
in under the side when no one was looking.Rosenfeld absolutely
refused to take the usher's arm which was offered her, and said she
guessed she was able to walk up alone.Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete
chauffeur's outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was
his State license pinned over his heart.The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to
supper.Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case
only ice cream and cake were served at the house?Or was it just as well
to trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit
down to a cold snack when they got home?To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the
wedding was Sidney--Sidney only.He watched her first steps down the
aisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched
the swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him
and went forward past the long rows of craning necks.Afterward he could
not remember the wedding party at all.The service for him was Sidney,
rather awed and very serious, beside the altar.It was Sidney who came
down the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney
with Max beside her!On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her
new career.They were more than
that--they were triumphant.Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes
over the church, filled with potential brides.To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace
and chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph.But to
Anna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish
lips, was coming her hour.Sitting back in the pew, with her hands
folded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight
young daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes.As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been
standing at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out.He
stumbled, rather, as if he could not see.CHAPTER XIV


The supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper
Carlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together.Carlotta had
selected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of
the city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson
had gone out to see her.For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice.She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he
would pay as little as possible.But she knew, too, that, let him want a
thing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage.The very ardor in her face was in her favor.She would put the thing
through, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening
prayers, a thing or two.During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate
than the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves
rolled up to show her satiny arms.There were no other boarders at the
little farmhouse.She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square
yard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully
posed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road.She read
Browning, Emerson, Swinburne.Once he found her with a book that she
hastily concealed.He insisted on seeing it, and secured it.Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her
eyes.His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as
she had intended.Sandra journeyed to the garden."I feel such an idiot when I am with you," she said."I wanted to know a
little more about the things you do."That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis.Thereafter
he occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment.His work, a sealed book to his women before,
lay open to her.Now and then their professional discussions ended in something
different.I can talk
shop with you without either shocking or nauseating you.You are the
most intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest."He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible
purpose of admiring the view."As long as you talk shop," she said, "I feel that there is nothing
wrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--"

"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?"He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her."The loveliest mouth in the world!"She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done.Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride.No, she was not angry, she said.It was only that he had set her
thinking.When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and
good-bye.After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it."Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the
most dangerous of toys."A spice of danger had entered into their
relationship.He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison
had gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back.Every man likes to think that
he is a bit of a devil.Max settled his tie, and, leaving his
car outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the
direction Carlotta had taken.He found her, face down, under a tree,
looking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental
struggle.She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a
foot or two, with her hands out before her.I--I have got to
have a little time alone.He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was
quite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree
and lighted a cigarette before he answered."I was afraid of this," he said, playing up.I am not really a villain, Carlotta."It was the first time he had used her name."Sit down and let us talk things over."She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing
to him with the somber eyes that were her great asset."You can afford to be very calm," she said, "because this is only play
to you; I know it.I'm a good listener and
not--unattractive.But what is play for you is not necessarily play for
me.For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity.If she cried--he was at
the mercy of any woman who cried.This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr.She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her
in his arms.You make me feel like
a scoundrel, and I've only been taking a little bit of happiness.Max, and kissed her again on the lips.Sandra moved to the bedroom.The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself.She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value.But
she had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor
which in every relationship between man and woman determines the
equation,--the woman.Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element.She
who, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and
the things thereof, found that it would not be put aside.By the end of
her short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger
Wilson.They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,
perhaps.The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they
lost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man.She was shrewd
enough to realize her own situation.She
cared, and he did not.It was all a game now, not hers.All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so.As well as
she knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she
realized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the
real thing for Sidney Page.Suspicion became certainty after a talk
they had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after
Christine's wedding."How was the wedding--tiresome?"There's always something thrilling to me in a man tying
himself up for life to one woman."That's not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?"To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,
and electing to spend the rest of one's days with her!Although--"

His eyes looked past Carlotta into distance."Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids," he said irrelevantly."She was
lovelier than the bride.""Pretty, but stupid," said Carlotta.I've really tried to
teach her things, but--you know--" She shrugged her shoulders.If there was a twinkle in his eye, he
veiled it discreetly.But, once again in the machine, he bent over and
put his cheek against hers.You're jealous," he said exultantly.Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very
close to his heart those autumn days.Sidney came off night duty the middle of November.The night duty had
been a time of comparative peace to Carlotta.Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Sidney's half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on
Carlotta's part.On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she
could not contain herself.She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and
took the trolley to a point near the end of the Street.After twilight
fell, she slowly walked the length of the Street.Christine and Palmer
had not returned from their wedding journey.The November evening was
not cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr.K. was
there, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying
little, his steady eyes on Sidney's profile.She went on down the Street in a frenzy
of jealous anger.After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta's mind: one was to get
Sidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her.In
her heart she knew that on the first depended the second.A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different
result.Sidney was not in sight, or Wilson.But standing on the wooden
doorstep of the little house was Le Moyne.The ailanthus trees were
bare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky.The
street-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now
shone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne's tall
figure and set face.She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew.It was the first time
she had known that K. lived in the Page house.It gave her a sense of
uncertainty and deadly fear.She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the
following day.They met in the locker-room in the basement where the
street clothing for the ward patients was kept.Here, rolled in bundles
and ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which
the patients had met accident or illness.Rags and tidiness, filth and
cleanliness, lay almost touching.Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were
unloading gleaming cans of milk.Floods of sunlight came down the
cellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver.Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order.Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation
of her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully."Grace Irving is going out to-day.When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not
live, it's rather a triumph, isn't it?"Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her
hand."She can't go out in those; I shall have to lend her something."A
little of the light died out of her face."She's had a hard fight, and
she has won," she said."But when I think of what she's probably going
back to--"

Carlotta shrugged her shoulders."It's all in the day's work," she observed indifferently."You can take
them up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or
put them in the laundry ironing.She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully."Well, what do you know about this?Here's a woman who came in in a
nightgown and pair of slippers.And now she wants to go out in half an
hour!"She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance
at Sidney."I happened to be on your street the other night," she said."You live
across the street from Wilsons', don't you?""I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house.Your--your brother
was standing on the steps."It isn't really
right to call him a roomer; he's one of the family now."'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney.The two girls
went toward the elevator together.With a very little encouragement,
Sidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison's friendly tone,
glad that things were all right between them again.At her floor, she
put a timid hand on the girl's arm."I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you," she said."I'm so
glad it isn't so."Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his
promotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two
dollars a week he was able to do several things.Rosenfeld now
washed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie
might have more time to look after Anna.He had increased also the
amount of money that he periodically sent East.The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense
of failure was Max Wilson's attitude.It was not unfriendly; it was,
indeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential.But he clearly
considered Le Moyne's position absurd.There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was
beginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of
friction.Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne.There were long
consultations in that small upper room.Perhaps more than one man or
woman who did not know of K.'s existence owed his life to him that fall.Cases began to come in to him
from the surrounding towns.To his own daring was added a new and
remarkable technique.But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not
content, was once again in touch with the work he loved.There were
times when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next
day's work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the
hills, fighting his battle.The longing was on him to be in the thick
of things again.The thought of the gas office and its deadly round
sickened him.It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie.It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to
rain as it fell.The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside
paths thick with sodden leaves.The dreariness of the countryside that
Saturday afternoon suited his mood.He had ridden to the end of the
street-car line, and started his walk from there.As was his custom, he
wore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat.Somewhere along
the road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for
human society, it trotted companionably at his heels.Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and
stopped in for a glass of Scotch.The dog
went in with him, and stood looking up into his face.It was as if he
submitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road
ahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields.The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills.Through the mist
of the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him.The door
was ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet.To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,
and in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers.To the
left, the typical parlor of such places.It might have been the parlor
of the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all.Over
everything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish.The house
was aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the
doors gleamed.called K.

There were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,
the rustle of a woman's dress coming down the stairs.K., standing
uncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,
stripped off his sweater.he said to the unseen female on the
staircase.She put a hand against the
doorframe to steady herself.Tillie surely, but a new Tillie!With her
hair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the
throat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,
infinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her.But she did not
smile at him.There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog's
expression, submissive, but questioning."Well, you've found me, Mr.And, when he held out his hand,
smiling: "I just had to do it, Mr.You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie."Schwitter's gone to the postoffice.Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?"The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie.The Street did
not approve of "something else.""Scotch-and-soda," said Le Moyne."And shall I buy a ticket for you to
punch?"He was sorry he had made the blunder.Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject.It was for this that she had exchanged
the virginal integrity of her life at Mrs.McKee's--for this wind-swept
little house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely.There were two crayon
enlargements over the mantel.The
other was the paper-doll wife.K. wondered what curious instinct of
self-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed.Back of its position of honor he saw the girl's realization of her own
situation.On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was
another vase of dried flowers.Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass.K. would
have preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good."You gave me a turn at first," said Tillie."But I am right glad to see
you, Mr.Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much.Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the
common ground of food.They no longer had that, and between them both
lay like a barrier their last conversation.More attractive it certainly was,
but happy?There was a wistfulness about Tillie's mouth that set him
wondering."He's about the best man on earth.He's never said a cross word to
me--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.""I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding
when I heard people around the place.It used to seem to me that what
