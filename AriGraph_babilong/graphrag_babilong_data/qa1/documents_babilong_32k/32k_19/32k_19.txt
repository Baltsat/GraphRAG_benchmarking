In small quantities it
exhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in
large ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and
death."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen
and jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote
to tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand
or his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his
horticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of
his late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in
another rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he
paints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even
could not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and
giving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the
outskirts of _St.Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample
garden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of
taste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that
_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this
Boniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling
along our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those
road-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to
in p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these
countries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those
of any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden
attached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high
degree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at
Upsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through
its fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate
historian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic
neighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the
many neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich
scenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who
kept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great
delight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the
purpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed
soon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he
intended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and
labour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from
Monmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of
laborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,
most of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce
considerably adds to the owner's support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the
Memory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as
long as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first
personal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been
exquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her
features, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the
appearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the
precise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In
reciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;
and, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the
impression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my
observation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any
other age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased
friend's expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few
lines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of
a father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing
from their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to
church.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat
and clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their
parents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties
they have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their
richer neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the
blessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to
heaven.an account of
some of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and
polite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following
compliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:

   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,
   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;
   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,
   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._



[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total
number of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,
of which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,
pomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry
VIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud
accession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are
chiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of
the Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton's
description:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and
romantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by
description to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to
that taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,

   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._

A narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling
rock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to
an awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in
the dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;
while, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by
natural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that
reflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses
the water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,
branching in various directions, including some miles in length, is
occasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered
seats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing
horrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent
retirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when
his mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,
Esq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an
inmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and
his mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant
intruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and
delighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,
"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and
particularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,
on this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;
and here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,
during the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high
approbation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,
speaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of
praise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original
and masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first
kindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;
and the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says
equalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the
majesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of
Anacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,
and the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise
on the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr.Price
himself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he
sketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future
general history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his
own time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that
spirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation
of "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from
the Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages
of this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his
Essays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of
some of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will
not be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the
Gothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian
buildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible
claim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true
points both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their
architecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their
sculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight
thus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and
Pathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person
who has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable
ecclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and
magnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of
devotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only
the impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the
imposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the
sacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,
raise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and
majesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of
the levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of
fashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old
gardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;
and therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether
proceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time
and accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens
of ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many
hints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern
improvements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour
of many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most
I could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;
and to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence
that still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a
professor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.
P. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:
"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more
complex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it
to pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some
wheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried
them off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,
always recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern
improvers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the
terraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,
they take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with
turf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their
employers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for
persevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in
person."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and
monotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had
great merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some
of our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of
their altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft
interred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature's favourite haunts
are the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of
witchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of
this poet.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.John went back to the kitchen.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.John went back to the hallway.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned

lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.Daniel travelled to the kitchen.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Mary travelled to the garden.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.Mary went to the office.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

  - "etc," changed to "etc.""Oh, don't call me that," she pleaded."You make me feel a
thousand years old.""Nonsense," laughed Aggie, and before Zoie could again detain her she
was out of the room.When the outside door had closed behind her friend, Zoie gazed about
the room disconsolately, but her depression was short-lived.Remembering
Aggie's permission about the letter, she ran quickly to the writing
table, curled her small self up on one foot, placed a brand new pen in
the holder, then drew a sheet of paper toward her and, with shoulders
hunched high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a
child, she began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications
that were ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement.CHAPTER XI

When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie, his
subsequent encounter with Alfred, and his enforced luncheon at home
with Aggie, he found his mail, his 'phone calls, and his neglected
appointments in a state of hopeless congestion, and try as he would, he
could not concentrate upon their disentanglement.Growing more and more
furious with the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his
desk, looking down upon him expectantly, and waiting for his tardy
instructions, Jimmy rose and looked out of the window.He could feel
Andrew's reproachful eyes following him."Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now?"asked Andrew, and he
wondered how late the office staff would be kept to-night to make up for
the time that was now being wasted.Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest, Andrew's
implied reproach was too much for Jimmy's overwrought nerves.And when Andrew could assure himself that
he had heard aright, he stalked out of the door with his head high in
the air.Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred.It was
apparent to him that the whole world was against him.His family, friends, and business associates
had undoubtedly lost all respect for him.From this day forth he was
determined to show himself to be a man of strong mettle.Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he
was about to start on a new life, Jimmy strode to the door of the office
and, without disturbing the injured Andrew, he called sharply to Miss
Perkins to come at once and take his letters.Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of
the "cut-glass" industry.Invariably his mind would wander back to the
unexpected incidents of the morning.Stopping suddenly in the middle of
a letter to a competing firm, he began pacing hurriedly up and down the
room.Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from
her as an act of impertinence, Miss Perkins, having learned all the
company's cut-glass quotations by rote, could easily have supplied the
remainder of the letter.As it was, she waited impatiently, tapping the
corner of the desk with her idle pencil.Jimmy turned at the sound, and
glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval.After one or two more uneasy laps about the room, Jimmy went
to his 'phone and called his house number."It's undoubtedly domestic trouble," decided Miss Perkins, and she
wondered whether it would be delicate of her, under the circumstances,
to remain in the room.From her employer's conversation at the 'phone, it was clear to Miss
Perkins that Mrs.Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy,
but why this should have so annoyed MR.Jinks was a question that Miss
Perkins found it difficult to answer.Jinks's
present state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful
young wife of his friend?"Oh dear," thought Miss Perkins, "how
scandalous!""That will do," commanded Jimmy, interrupting Miss Perkins's interesting
speculations, and he nodded toward the door."But----" stammered Miss Perkins, as she glanced at the unfinished
letters."I'll call you when I need you," answered Jimmy gruffly.Miss Perkins
left the room in high dudgeon."I'LL show them," said Jimmy to himself, determined to carry out his
recent resolve to be firm.Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles."Suppose, that Zoie,
after imposing secrecy upon him, should change that thing called her
'mind' and confide in Aggie about the luncheon?"He decided to telephone to Zoie's house and find out how affairs
were progressing."If Aggie HAS found out
about the luncheon," he argued, "my 'phoning to Zoie's will increase her
suspicions.If Zoie has told her nothing, she'll wonder why I'm 'phoning
to Zoie's house.There's only one thing to do," he decided.I can tell from Aggie's face when I meet her at dinner
whether Zoie has betrayed me."Having arrived at this conclusion, Jimmy resolved to get home as early
as possible, and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid.The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the day's remaining business
confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that
"the boss" had suddenly "gone off his head."And when he at last left
the office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of
relief from his usually tranquil staff.Instead of walking, as was his custom, Jimmy took a taxi to his home but
alas, to his surprise he found no wife."None at all," answered that unperturbed creature; and Jimmy felt sure
that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to
his household servants.When Jimmy's anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a woman's dress in
the hallway, his dinner had been waiting half an hour, and he had
worked himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and
everybody.At the sound of Aggie's voice however, his heart began to pound with
fear."Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he
was?Would she tell him that they were going to separate forever?""Awfully sorry to be so late,
dear," she said.Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his
neck.He decided forthwith to tell her everything, and never, never
again to run the risk of deceiving her; but before he could open his
lips, she continued gaily:

"I've brought Zoie home with me, dear.There's no sense in her eating
all alone, and she's going to have ALL her dinners with us.""After dinner," continued Aggie, "you and I can take her to
the theatre and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes
home."Was it possible that Alfred had already
relented?"Oh, he doesn't know it yet," explained Aggie, "but he's coming.We'll
tell you all about it at dinner."While waiting for Aggie, Jimmy had thought himself hungry, but once
the two women had laid before him their "nefarious baby-snatching
scheme"--food lost its savour for him, and one course after another was
taken away from him untouched.Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan,
as scheduled by them, he met the threatening eye of Zoie; and by the
time that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by
the chatter of the two excited women, that he was not only reconciled
but eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back, and
free him of the enforced companionship of Alfred's nerve-racking wife.True, he reflected, it was possible that Alfred, on his return, might
discover him to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out
his murderous threat; but even such a fate was certainly preferable to
interminable evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie."All YOU need do, Jimmy," explained Aggie sweetly, when the three of
them were comfortably settled in the library, "is to see your friend
the Superintendent of the Babies' Home, and tell him just what kind of a
baby we shall need, and when we shall need it.""Oh yes, indeed," said Aggie confidently, and she turned to Jimmy with
a matter-of-fact tone."You'd better tell the Superintendent to have
several for us to look at when the time arrives.""Yes, that's better," agreed Zoie.As for Jimmy, he had long ceased to make any audible comment, but
internally he was saying to himself: "man of strong mettle, indeed!""We'll attend to all the clothes for the child," said Aggie generously
to Jimmy."I want everything to be hand-made," exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically."We can make a great many of the things ourselves, evenings," said
Aggie, "while we sit here and talk to Jimmy."Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden."MOST evenings," assented Aggie."And then toward the last, you know,
Zoie----" she hesitated to explain further, for Jimmy was already
becoming visibly embarrassed."Oh, yes, that's true," blushed Zoie.There was an awkward pause, then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy, who
was pretending to rebuild the fire."Oh yes, one more thing," she said."When everything is quite ready for Alfred's return, we'll allow you,
Jimmy dear, to wire him the good news.""I wish it were time to wire now," said Zoie pensively, and in his mind,
Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment."The next few months will slip by before you know it," declared Aggie
cheerfully."And by the way, Zoie," she added, "why should you go back
to your lonesome flat to-night?"Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief--Jimmy sat up to receive
the next blow."Stay here with us," suggested Aggie."We'll be so glad
to have you."When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night, Jimmy remained
in his chair by the fire, too exhausted to even prepare for bed.This had certainly been the longest day of his life.CHAPTER XII

WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly
for Zoie, she was quite correct.They passed quickly for Aggie as well;
but how about Jimmy?When he afterward recalled this interval in his
life, it was always associated with long strands of lace winding around
the legs of the library chairs, white things lying about in all the
places where he had once enjoyed sitting or lying, late dinners, lonely
breakfasts, and a sense of isolation from Aggie.One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with
Aggie, he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been
helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion."It is all done in pink and white," explained Aggie, and then followed
detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens, the soft lovely hangings,
and even the entire relighting of the room.asked Jimmy, objecting to any scheme of Zoie's on general
principles."It's Alfred's favourite colour," explained Aggie."Besides, it's so
becoming," she added.Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfred's senses was
absolutely indecent, and he said so."Upon my word," answered Aggie, quite affronted, "you are getting as
unreasonable as Alfred himself."Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk, she
added coaxingly, "I was GOING to tell you about Zoie's lovely new
negligee, and about the dear little crib that just matches it."I can't think why you've taken such a dislike to that helpless child,"
said Aggie.A few days later, while in the midst of his morning's mail, Jimmy was
informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the
Babies' Home to select the last, but most important, detail for
their coming campaign.According to instructions, Jimmy had been in
communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home, and he now led
the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he, at least, had
attended properly to his part of the business.By the time they reached
the Children's Home, several babies were on view for their critical
inspection.Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee, red mites with
puckered faces.she exclaimed, "haven't you any white ones?""These are supposed to be white," said the Superintendent, with an
indulgent smile, "the black ones are on the other side of the room."cried Zoie in horror, and she faced about quickly as
though expecting an attack from their direction."Which particular one of these would you recommend?"asked the practical
Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot."Well, it's largely a matter of taste, ma'am," he answered."This seems
a healthy little chap," he added, and seizing the long white clothes
of the nearest infant, he drew him across his arm and held him out for
Aggie's inspection."Let's see," cried Zoie, and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the
Superintendent's elbow.As for Jimmy, he stood gloomily apart.This was an ordeal for which
he had long been preparing himself, and he was resolved to accept it
philosophically."I don't think much of that one," snipped Zoie."It's not MY affair," answered Jimmy curtly.Aggie perceived trouble brewing, and she turned to pacify Jimmy."Which
one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like?""If I were in his place----" began Jimmy hotly."Oh, but you AREN'T," interrupted Zoie; then she turned to the
Superintendent."What makes some of them so much larger than others?"she asked, glancing at the babies he had CALLED "white.""Well, you see they're of different ages," explained the Superintendent
indulgently.Jinks they must all be of the same age," said Zoie with a
reproachful look at Jimmy."I should say a week old," said Aggie."Then this is the one for you," decided the Superintendent, designating
his first choice."I think we'd better take the Superintendent's advice," said Aggie
complacently.Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air.Was it possible
that all babies were as homely as these?"You know, Zoie," explained Aggie, divining her thought, "they get
better looking as they grow older.""Fetch it home, Jimmy," said Aggie.exclaimed Jimmy, who had considered his mission completed."You don't expect US to carry it, do you?"The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
signed the necessary papers for its release."I thought all those details had been attended to," said Aggie, and
again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment."I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,"
volunteered the Superintendent."Very well," said Zoie, "and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
for it," and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi."Now," said Zoie, when they were properly seated, "let's stop at a
telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.""Wait until we get the baby," cautioned Aggie."We'll have it the first thing in the morning," argued Zoie."Jimmy can send him a night-letter," compromised Aggie, "that way Alfred
won't get the news until morning."A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and
with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.CHAPTER XIII

When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away
from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
ferment.Having settled this
point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper
and leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal
matters, by learning what was going on in the world at large.No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by
a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down
the aisle."Detroit," answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption."THAT'S a funny thing," declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
funny it really was."You know," he continued, so loud that everyone in
the vicinity could not fail to hear him, "the last time I met you two,
you were on your honeymoon--on THIS VERY TRAIN," and with that the
fellow sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a
long list of compliments about "the fine little girl" who had in his
opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to
a "dull, money-grubbing chap" like him."So," thought Alfred, "this is the way the world sees
