[_Opening his eyes._] Where am I now?SIR TRISTRAM _and_ HATCHAM

[_Quietly._] Hurrah![_To HATCHAM._] We can't shout here; go and cheer
as loudly as you can in the roadway by yourself.[_HATCHAM runs out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_Gradually recovering._] Georgiana--Mardon.How are you, Jedd, old boy?I feel as if I had been walked over carefully by a large concourse of
the lower orders![_HATCHAM'S voice is heard in the distance cheering.They all listen._

SIR TRISTRAM.That's Hatcham; I'll raise his wages.Do I understand that I have been forcibly and illegally rescued?A woman who would have been a heroine in any age--Georgiana!Georgiana, I am bound to overlook it, in a relative, but never let
this occur again.You found out that that other woman's plan went lame, didn't you?I discovered its inefficacy, after a prolonged period of ineffectual
whistling.But we ascertained the road the genial constable was going to follow.He was bound for the edge of the hill, up Pear Tree Lane, to watch the
Races.Directly we knew this, Tris and I made for the Hill.Bless your
soul, there were hundreds of my old friends there--welshers,
pick-pockets, card-sharpers, all the lowest race-course cads in the
kingdom.In a minute I was in the middle of 'em, as much at home as a
Duchess in a Drawing-room.Instantly
there was a cry of "Blessed if it ain't George Tidd!"Tears of real
joy sprang to my eyes--while I was wiping them away Tris had his
pockets emptied and I lost my watch.Ah, Jedd, it was a glorious moment!Tris made a back, and I stood on it, supported by a correct-card
merchant on either side."Dear friends," I said; "Brothers!You should have heard the shouts of honest welcome.Before I could obtain silence my field glasses had gone on their long
journey."A very dear relative of mine has
been collared for playing the three-card trick on his way down from
town.""He'll be on the brow of the
Hill with a bobby in half-an-hour," said I, "who's for the rescue?"A
dead deep silence followed, broken only by the sweet voice of a young
child, saying, "What'll we get for it?""A pound a-piece," said I.
There was a roar of assent, and my concluding words, "and possibly six
months," were never heard.At that moment Tris' back could stand it no
longer, and we came heavily to the ground together.[_Seizing THE DEAN
by the hand and dragging him up._] Now you know whose hands have led
you back to your own manger.[_Embracing him._] And oh, brother,
confess--isn't there something good and noble in true English sport
after all?But whence
is the money to come to reward these dreadful persons?I cannot
reasonably ask my girls to organize a bazaar or concert.Well, I've cleared fifteen hundred over the Handicap.Then the horse who enjoyed the shelter of the
Deanery last night----

SIR TRISTRAM.All the rest nowhere, and Bonny Betsy walked in
with the policeman.[_To himself._] Five hundred pounds towards the Spire!Oh, where is Blore with the good news!Sir Tristram, I am under the impression that your horse swallowed
reluctantly a small portion of that bolus last night before I was
surprised and removed.By the bye, I am expecting the analysis of that concoction every
minute.Spare yourself the trouble--the secret is with me.I seek no
acknowledgment from either of you, but in your moment of deplorable
triumph remember with gratitude the little volume of "The Horse and
its Ailments" and the prosaic name of its humane author--John Cox.[_He goes out through the Library._

GEORGIANA.But oh, Tris Mardon, what can I ever say to you?Why, you were the man who hauled Augustin out of the
cart by his legs!And when his cap fell off, it was you--brave
fellow that you are--who pulled the horse's nose-bag over my brother's
head so that he shouldn't be recognized.My dear Georgiana, these are the common courtesies of every-day life.They are acts which any true woman would esteem.Gus won't readily
forget the critical moment when all the cut chaff ran down the back of
his neck--nor shall I.

SIR TRISTRAM.Nor shall I forget the way in which you gave Dandy his whisky out of a
soda water bottle just before the race.That's nothing--any lady would do the same.You looked like the Florence Nightingale of the paddock!Oh,
Georgiana, why, why, why won't you marry me?Because you've only just asked me, Tris![_Goes to him cordially._

SIR TRISTRAM.But when I touched your hand last night, you reared!Yes, Tris, old man, but love is founded on mutual esteem; last night
you hadn't put my brother's head in that nose-bag.[_They go together to the fireplace, he with his arm round her waist._

SHEBA.[_Looking in at the door._] How annoying!There's Aunt and Sir
Tristram in this room--Salome and Major Tarver are sitting on the hot
pipes in the conservatory--where am I and Mr.[_She withdraws quickly as THE DEAN enters through the Library
carrying a paper in his hand; he has now resumed his normal
appearance._

THE DEAN.Home, with the secret of my
sad misfortune buried in the bosoms of a faithful few.Home, with the sceptre of my dignity still
tight in my grasp!What is this I have picked up on the stairs?[_Reads with a horrified look, as HATCHAM enters at the window._

HATCHAM.The chemist has just brought the annal_i_sis.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA go out at the window, following HATCHAM._

THE DEAN.[_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to
the Queen, Bow Street--Total, Forty pounds, nineteen!"There was a
fancy masked ball at Durnstone last night!Salome--Sheba--no, no![_Bounding in and rushing at THE DEAN._] Papa, Papa![_SALOME seizes his hands, SHEBA his coat-tails, and turn him round
violently._

SALOME.Papa, why have you tortured us with anxiety?Before I answer a question, which, from a child to its parent,
partakes of the unpardonable vice of curiosity, I demand an
explanation of this disreputable document.[_Reading._] "Debtor to
Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to the Queen."[_SHEBA sits aghast on the table--SALOME distractedly falls on the
floor._

THE DEAN.I will not follow this legend in all its revolting intricacies.Suffice it, its moral is inculcated by the mournful total.[_Looking from one to the other._]
There was a ball at Durnstone last night.I trust I was better--that is, otherwise employed.[_Referring
to the bill._] Which of my hitherto trusted daughters was a lady--no,
I will say a person--of the period of the French Revolution?[_SHEBA points to SALOME._

THE DEAN.And a flower-girl of an unknown epoch.[_SALOME points to SHEBA._] To
your respective rooms![_The girls cling together._] Let your blinds
be drawn.At seven porridge will be brought to you.Papa, we, poor girls as we are, can pay the bill.Through the kindness of our Aunt----

SALOME.Is there no
conscience that is clear--is there no guilessness left in this house,
with the possible exception of my own![_Sobbing._] We always knew a little more than you gave us credit for,
Papa.[_Handing SHEBA the bill._] Take this horrid thing--never let it meet
my eyes again.As for the scandalous costumes, they shall be raffled
for in aid of local charities.Confidence, that precious pearl in the
snug shell of domesticity, is at an end between us.I chastise you
both by permanently withholding from you the reason of my absence from
home last night.[_The girls totter out as SIR TRISTRAM enters quickly at the window,
followed by GEORGIANA, carrying the basin containing the bolus.SIR
TRISTRAM has an opened letter in his hand._

SIR TRISTRAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_To GEORGIANA._] How dare you confront me without even the semblance
of a blush--you who have enabled my innocent babies, for the first
time in their lives, to discharge one of their own accounts.There isn't a blush in our family--if there were, you'd want it.[_SHEBA and SALOME appear outside the window, looking in._

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, you were once my friend, and you are to be my relative.[_Looking at GEORGIANA._] My sister![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] I offer no
opposition.But not even our approaching family tie prevents my designating you as
one of the most atrocious conspirators known in the history of the
Turf.As the owner of one-half of Dandy Dick, I denounce you!As the owner of the other half, _I_ denounce you!_SHEBA and SALOME enter, and remain standing in the recess,
listening._

SIR TRISTRAM.The chief ingredient of your infernal preparation is known.It contains nothing that I would not cheerfully administer to my own
children.[_Pointing to the paper._] Strychnine![_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh!Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the
innocuous mixture was compounded.[_GEORGIANA rings the bell.The
girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the
pardonable result of over-enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist.You're a disgrace to the pretty little police station where you slept
last night![_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._

THE DEAN.I will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of
hospitality have never been transgressed.[_GEORGIANA hands THE DEAN the basin from the table._] A simple remedy
for a chill.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.Sandra went to the bathroom.I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night.[_Taking the
remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me![_Rushing forward, snatching the basin from THE DEAN and sinking on to
his knees._] No, no!You wouldn't 'ang the holdest
servant in the Deanery.I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and I wanted this
gentleman's 'orse out of the way.And while you was mixing the dose
with the best ecclesiastical intentions, I hintroduced a foreign
element.[_Pulling BLORE up by his coat collar._] Viper!Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean.The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes,
and I thought a gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a
certainty.I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unworthy creature to
back Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund.[_Shaking BLORE._] And didn't you do it?In the name of that tottering Spire, why not?Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put
your cheerful little offering on to Bonny Betsy.[_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._

THE DEAN.[_To BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act
of disobedience.If I leave the Deanery, I shall give my reasons, and then what'll
folks think of you and me in our old age?Not if sober, sir--but suppose grief drove me to my cups?I must save you from intemperance at any cost.Remain in my service--a
sad, sober and, above all, a silent man![_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out through the window._

SALOME.Darbey!----

THE DEAN.If you have sufficiently merged all sense of moral rectitude as to
declare that I am not at home, do so.Papa; we have accidentally discovered that you, our parent,
have stooped to deception, if not to crime.We are still young--the sooner, therefore, we are removed from any
unfortunate influence the better.We have an opportunity of beginning life afresh.These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us.[_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHEBA.Directly they
have disappeared, NOAH TOPPING, looking dishevelled, rushes in at the
window, with HANNAH clinging to him._

NOAH.[_Glaring round the room._] Is this 'ere the Deanery?[_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._

HANNAH.Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my face was
unofficially held downwards in the mud.The villain has been traced
back to the Deanery.The man was a unknown lover of my nooly made wife!You mustn't bring your domestic affairs here; this is a subject for
your own fireside of an evening.[_THE DEAN appears outside the window with SALOME, SHEBA, TARVER and
DARBEY._

THE DEAN.[_Outside._] Come in, Major Tarver--come in, Mr._THE DEAN enters, followed by SALOME, TARVER, SHEBA and DARBEY._

NOAH.[_Confronting THE DEAN._] My man.I'm speaking to the man I took last night--the culprit as 'as
allynated the affections of my wife.[_Going out at the window._

[_SALOME and TARVER go into the Library and sit at the writing-table.DARBEY sits in an arm-chair with SHEBA on the arm._

THE DEAN.[_Mildly._] Do not let us chide a man who is conscientious even in
error.[_Looking at HANNAH._] I think I see Hannah Evans, once an
excellent cook under this very roof.Topping now, sir--bride o' the constable.And oh, do forgive
him--he's a mass o' ignorance.[_HANNAH returns to NOAH.as SIR TRISTRAM re-enters with HATCHAM._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HATCHAM._] Hatcham--[_pointing to THE DEAN_]--Is that the man you
and the Constable secured in the stable last night?Bless your 'art, sir, that's the Dean 'imself.[_To NOAH._] Why, our man was a short, thin individual![_HATCHAM goes out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_To NOAH._] I trust you are perfectly satisfied.[_Wiping his brow and looking puzzled._] I'm doon.I withdraw unreservedly any charge against this
unknown person found on my premises last night.I attribute to him the
most innocent intentions.Hannah, you and your worthy husband will
stay and dine in my kitchen.[_Turning angrily to HANNAH._] Now then, you don't know a real
gentleman when you see one.Why don't 'ee thank the Dean warmly?[_Kissing THE DEAN'S hands with a curtsey._] Thank you, sir.[_Benignly._] Go--go.[_They back out, bowing and curtseying._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, you're out of all your troubles.My family influence gone forever--my dignity crushed out of all
recognition--the genial summer of the Deanery frosted by the winter of
Deceit.Ah, Gus, when once you lay the whip about the withers of the horse
called Deception he takes the bit between his teeth, and only the
devil can stop him--and he'd rather not.Shall I tell you who has been
riding the horse hardest?[_SHEBA sits at the piano and plays a bright air softly--DARBEY
standing behind her--SALOME and TARVER stand in the archway._

GEORGIANA.[_Slapping THE DEAN on the back._] Look here, Augustin, George Tidd
will lend you that thousand for the poor, innocent old Spire.[_Taking her hand._] Oh, Georgiana!On one condition--that you'll admit there's no harm in our laughing at
a Sporting Dean.My brother Gus doesn't want us to be merry at his expense.[_They both laugh._

THE DEAN.[_Trying to silence them._] No, no!Why, Jedd, there's no harm in laughter, for those who laugh or those
who are laughed at.Provided always--firstly, that it is Folly that is laughed at and not
Virtue; secondly, that it is our friends who laugh at us, [_to the
audience_] as we hope they all will, for our pains.THE END



_Transcriber's Note_

This transcription is based on the scan images posted by The Internet

In addition, when there was a question about the printed text, another
edition posted by The Internet Archive was consulted:

http://archive.org/details/dandydickplayint00pineiala

The following changes were made to the text:

-  Throughout the text, dashes at the end of lines have been
normalized.-  Throughout the text, "and" in the character titles preceding
dialogue has been italicized consistently and names in stage
directions have been consistently either capitalized (in the text
version) or set in small caps (in the html version).-  In the Introductory Note, "St.Marvells" has an apostrophe, whereas
in the text of the play it almost always does not.The inconsistency
has been allowed to stand in the Introductory Note, but the apostrophe
has been removed in the few instances in the text.25: "_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look..._"--A bracket has
been added to the beginning of this line.--The second "No" has been changed to lower
case.139: "Oh, what do you think of it.--The period
after "it" has been changed to a comma.141: "We can't shout here, go and cheer..."--The comma has been
changed to a semicolon.142: "That's Hatcham, I'll raise his wages."--The comma has
been changed to a semicolon.143: "'aint" has been changed to "ain't".147: "...mutual esteem, last night..."--The comma has been
changed to a semicolon.The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the
printed text.However, some concessions have been made, particularly
in the handling of stage directions enclosed by brackets on at least
one side.In general, the
stage directions were typeset in the printed text as follows:

-  Before and within dialogue.-  Flush right, on the same line as the end of dialogue if there was
enough space; on the next line, if there was not.-  If the stage directions were two lines, they were indented from the
left margin as hanging paragraphs.How much the stage directions were
indented varied.In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are
placed on the next line, indented the same amount from the left
margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.Corrections of
this kind are inserted in the text.On the other hand, absolutely
nothing new has appeared on Assyrian Architecture, and, therefore, Mr.Fergusson’s theories respecting the restoration of the Assyrian palaces
have been retained; the tendency of the opinion of archæologists having,
however, developed rather in the direction of vaulted roofs to the
principal halls, footnotes have been appended giving the views of
foreign archæologists on the subject, between which and Mr.Fergusson’s
views the student is left to judge.Fergusson’s views respecting the
arrangement of the plans of the Persian palaces, which were first
promulgated in 1855, has been confirmed by later explorations at
Persepolis, Susa, and Pasargadæ, and footnotes giving the records of the
same are appended.The results of recent discoveries in Greece and Italy have been
recorded, sometimes in the text, sometimes in footnotes; and changes
have been made in the chapter on Parthian and Sassanian Architecture, M.
Dieulafoy’s photographs having enabled the editor to correct some of the
woodcuts copied from Coste’s illustrations.Important changes have been made in the Second Part, devoted to
Christian Architecture; the Byzantine style has been placed first, not
only for chronological reasons as the first perfected Christian style,
but from the impossibility of otherwise following the development of the
Early Christian styles in Italy during the fifth and following
centuries.The Romanesque, or Early Christian, style in Italy has been included in
Book II., together with the later developments of style in that country;
this has enabled the editor to bring the description of St.Mark’s,
Venice, into the first chapter under Italy, to which chronologically it
belongs, instead of placing it after the Pointed Italian Gothic style.The Italian Byzantine chapter has been omitted, and the two or three
buildings described under it transferred to the Byzantine-Romanesque
chapter.By the new arrangement it is possible now to follow almost
chronologically the various phases of style in Italy.In the Book on the Byzantine style, some of the examples in Jerusalem
ascribed to Constantine have been transferred to Justinian’s time; but
this has naturally followed another very important change—the
description of the so-called Mosque of Omar, the Dome of the Rock, has
been transferred to the Saracenic style.Fergusson had few supporters in his theories respecting the builders of
this structure, and Prof.Hayter Lewis’s work has now removed all doubt
as to its having been the work of the Caliph Abd el Melik and his
followers.This change has necessitated a complete revision of the
description of the Holy Sepulchre, for which Prof.Hayter Lewis’s works have furnished the chief authorities.Various corrections have been made in the dates ascribed to the Mosques
in Cairo, and the French Expedition in Tunis has enabled the editor to
add a plan and view of the great Mosque of Kerouan, the most sacred
Mahomedan edifice after that of Mecca, and the one great early example
of which scarcely anything was known.About forty woodcuts have been specially prepared for this new edition,
half of which are of subjects not before illustrated, the remainder
replacing those which were defective or absolutely incorrect.In
addition to these, various alterations where required have been made to
other woodcuts.The several authorities consulted have been acknowledged in the course
of the work, but the editor desires here to express his obligations to
Mr.Arthur Hill for advice on the
German, English, and Irish sections respectively.During the period that has elapsed since the first edition of this work
was published,[1] no important work on the History of Architecture has
appeared which throws any new light on either the theory or practice of
the art, and, except in India, no new buildings have been discovered and
no monographs published that materially add to our general stores of
knowledge.The truth of the matter appears to be that the architectural productions
of all the countries mentioned in these two volumes have been examined
and described to a sufficient extent for the purposes of the general
historian.A great deal of course remains to be done before all the
information required for the student of any particular style can be
supplied, but nothing of any great importance probably remains to be
discovered in the countries of the Old World, nor anything that is at
all likely to alter any views or theories founded on what we at present
know.The one exception to this satisfactory state of things is our knowledge,
or rather want of knowledge, regarding the history of the ancient
architecture of the New World, treated of in the last few pages of this
work.No important addition has lately been made to the little we knew
before, and it is now to be feared that Mr.Squier’s long-expected work
on the Antiquities of Peru may never see the light, at least not under
the auspices of its author, and the Count de Waldeck’s work adds very
little, if anything, to what we knew before.What is really wanted is
that some one should make himself personally acquainted with all the
various styles existing between the upper waters of the Colorado and the
desert of Atacama to such an extent as to be able to establish the
relative sequence of their dates and to detect affinities where they
exist, or to point out differences that escape the casual observer.Photography may in the next few years do something towards enabling
stay-at-home travellers to do a good deal towards this, but photography
will never do all, and local knowledge is indispensable for the exact
determination of many now obscure questions.The problem is in fact
identical with that presented to Indian antiquaries some thirty years
ago.At that time we knew less of the history of Indian architecture
than we now know of American, but at the present day the date of every
building and every cave in India can be determined with almost absolute
certainty to within fifty, or at the outside one hundred, years; the
sequence is everywhere certain, and all can be referred to the race and
religion that practised that peculiar style.In America there are the
same strongly marked local peculiarities of style as in India,
accompanied by equally easily detected affinities or differences, and
what has been done for India could, I am convinced, easily be
accomplished for America, and with even more satisfactory and more
important results to the history and ethnography of that great country.The subject is well worthy of the attention of any one who may undertake
it, as it is the only means we now know of by which the ancient history
of the country can be recovered from the darkness that now enshrouds it
and the connexion of the Old world with the New—if any existed—can be
traced, but it is practically the only chapter in the history of
architecture which remains to be written.Notwithstanding this paucity of new material, the completion of M.
Place’s great work on Khorsabad, Wood’s explorations at Ephesus, Dr.Tristram’s travels in Moab, with other minor works, and new photographs
of other places, have furnished some twenty or thirty woodcuts to this
work, either of new examples or in substitution for less perfect
illustrations.More than this, the experience gained in the interval
from reading, and personal familiarity with buildings not before
visited, especially in Italy, have enabled me to add considerably to the
text and to correct or modify impressions based on less perfect
information.These, with a careful revision of the text throughout,
will, it is hoped, be found to render this edition an improvement to a
considerable extent over that which preceded it.As mentioned in the preface to the volume containing the History of the
Modern Styles of Architecture, the scheme of the present edition is that
the two volumes now published shall contain a description of all the
ancient styles of architecture known to exist either in the Old or New
world, except India.In the first edition the Indian styles occupied about 300 pages, and
were illustrated by 200 woodcuts.In the present one it is proposed to
double the extent of the text and to add such further illustrations as
may be found requisite fully to illustrate the subject.When this is
done it will form a separate volume, either the third of the general
History of Architecture, or a complete and independent work by itself,
and sold separately.If nothing unforeseen occurs to prevent it, it is
expected that the work will be published before the end of next year
(1875).The History of the Modern Styles of Architecture, published last year,
will then form the fourth and concluding volume of the work, or may be
considered as a complete and independent treatise, and, like the volume
containing the History of Indian Architecture, will be sold separately.As stated in the preface to the first edition, it was originally
intended that chapters should be added on what were then known as Celtic
or Druidical remains.When, however, the subject came to be carefully
looked into for that purpose, it was found that the whole was such a
confused mass of conflicting theories and dreams, that no facts or dates
were so established that they could be treated as historical.The
consequence was that the materials collected for the purpose were, in
1872, published in a separate volume, entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments,’
in the form rather of an argument than of a history.As was to be expected, a work of that nature, and which attacked the
established faith in the Druids, has been exposed to a considerable
amount of hostile criticism, but nothing has yet appeared that at all
touches the marrow of the question, or invalidates any of the more
important conclusions therein arrived at.On the other hand, everything
that has since come to light has tended to confirm them in a most
satisfactory manner.Colonel Brunon’s researches, for instance, at and
around the Madras’en, in Algeria, have proved that the tumuli in that
cemetery belong to Roman times.[2] In India sculptured and inscribed
dolmens have been dug up and photographed, so that their age is no
longer doubtful, and others, as archaic in form as any, are found
belonging to reigning families of chiefs, and still used by them.Schliemann’s explorations at Hissarlik have deprived the
prehistoric advocates of one of their most plausible arguments.At a
depth of 8½ metres from the surface he found the remains of a walled
city, with paved streets, and rich in gold, silver, and copper, with
their alloys electron and bronze, and every sign of a high civilization.Above this, through four or five metres of successive deposits,
indicating probably a duration of twice as many centuries, no trace of
metal was found, but, as he expresses, an “ungeheure menge,” and, in
another place, a “kolossale menge,” an unlimited number of rude stone
implements of every sort.Above this again, the remains of the Greek
city of Ilium Novum.If this were the case in Asia Minor in historic times, it is in vain to
argue that, when the imported civilization of the Romans passed away,
the Britons may not have returned to their old faith and old practices,
and adhered to them till a new conquest and a new faith led to their
being finally abandoned.It may, or it may not, have been so, but till
some better argument than has yet been brought forward is adduced to
prove that it was not so, the _à priori_ argument of improbability will
not now avail much.Whenever the facts, as stated in the ‘Rude Stone
Monuments,’ are admitted, or any better set of conclusions substituted
for them, their history may be added as a fifth volume to this work.Till then, people must be content with the hazy nihilism of the
prehistoric myth.FROM THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.Although the present work may in some respects be considered as only a
new edition of the ‘Handbook of Architecture,’ still the alterations,
both in substance and in form, have been so extensive as to render the
adoption of a new title almost indispensable.The topographical
arrangement, which was the basis of the ‘Handbook,’ has been abandoned,
and a historical sequence introduced in its place.This has entirely
altered the argument of the book, and, with the changes and additions
which it has involved, has rendered it practically a new work;
containing, it is true, all that was included in the previous
publication, but with a great deal that is new and little that retains
its original form.The logical reasons for these changes will be set forth in their proper
place in the body of the work; but meanwhile, as the Preface is that
part of it which should properly include all personal explanations, I
trust I may not be considered as laying myself open to a charge of
egotism, if I avail myself of this conventional licence in explaining
the steps by which this work attained its present form.It was my good fortune to be able to devote many years of my life to the
study of Architecture—as a fine art—under singularly favourable
circumstances: not only was I able to extend my personal observations to
the examples found in almost all the countries between China and the
Atlantic shore, but I lived familiarly among a people who were still
practising their traditional art on the same principles as those which
guided the architects of the Middle Ages in the production of similar
but scarcely more beautiful or more original works.With these
antecedents, I found myself in possession of a considerable amount of
information regarding buildings which had not previously been described,
and—what I considered of more value—of an insight into the theory of the
art, which was certainly even more novel.Believing this knowledge and these principles to be of sufficient
importance to justify me in so doing, I resolved on publishing a work in
which they should be embodied; and, in furtherance of this idea, sixteen
years ago I wrote a book entitled ‘The True Principles of Beauty in
Art.’ The work was not—nor was it intended to be—popular in its form.It
was an attempt of a young author to do what he thought right and best,
without consulting the wishes of the public on the subject, and the
first result, as might have been—and indeed was—anticipated, was that no
publisher would undertake it.In consequence of this, only the first
volume was published by Longmans in 1849, and that at my own expense and
risk.The event proved that the booksellers were right.The book did not
sell, and it became a question whether it was worth my while to waste my
time and spend my money on a work which the public did not want, or
whether it would not be wiser to abandon it, and wait for some more
favourable opportunity.Various circumstances of no public interest
induced me at the time to adopt the latter course, and I felt I could do
so without any breach of faith, as the work, as then published, was
complete in itself, though it had been intended to add two more volumes
to the one already published.Some years afterwards a proposal was made to me by Mr.Murray to utilise
the materials collected for the more ambitious work in the more popular
form of a Handbook of Architecture.The work was written in a very much
more popular manner than that I had previously adopted, or than I then
liked, or now think worthy of the subject; but the result proved that it
was a style much better suited to the public demand, for this time the
work was successful.Since its publication in 1855 a large number of
copies have been sold; the work has now for some years been out of
print, and a new edition is demanded.Under these circumstances the
question arose, whether it would be better to republish the Handbook in
its original form, with such additions and emendations as its
arrangement admitted of, or whether it would not be better to revert to
a form nearly approaching that adopted in the ‘True Principles,’ rather
than that followed in the composition of the Handbook, as one more
worthy of the subject, and better capable of developing its importance.The immense advantages of the historical over the topographical method
are too self-evident to require being pointed out, whenever the object
is to give a general view of the whole of such a subject as that treated
of in these volumes, or an attempt is made to trace the connexion of the
various parts to one another.If the intention is only to describe
particular styles or separate buildings, the topographical arrangement
may be found more convenient: but where anything beyond this is
attempted, the historical method is the only one which enables it to be
done.Believing that the architectural public do now desire something
more than mere dry information with regard to the age and shape of
buildings, it has been determined to remodel the work and to adopt the
historical arrangement.In the present instance there does not seem to be the usual objection to
such a rearrangement—that it would break the thread of continuity
between the old and the new publication—inasmuch as, whichever method
were adopted, the present work must practically be a new book.The mass
of information obtained during the last ten years has been so great that
even in the present volume a considerable portion of it had to be
rewritten, and a great deal added.In the second volume the alterations
will be even more extensive.The publication of the great national work
on Spanish antiquities,[3] of Parcerisa’s ‘Beauties, &c., of Spain,’[4]
and, above all, Mr.Street’s work,[5] have rendered Spanish architecture
as intelligible as that of any other country, though ten years ago it
was a mystery and a puzzle.Schulz’s[6] work has rendered the same
service for Southern Italy, while the publications of De Vogüé[7] and
Texier[8] will necessitate an entirely new treatment of the early
history of Byzantine art.The French have been busily occupied during
the last ten years in editing their national monuments; so have the
Germans.So that in Europe little of importance remains to be described.In Asia, too, great progress has been made.Photography has rendered us
familiar with many buildings we only knew before by description, and
both the Hindu and Mahomedan remains of India are now generally
accessible to the public.Colonel Yule’s[9] work on Burmah and M.
Mouhot’s[10] on Siam have made us acquainted with the form of the
buildings of those countries, and China too has been opened to the
architectural student.When the Handbook was written there were many
places and buildings regarding which no authentic information was
available.That can hardly be said to be the case now as respects any
really important building, and the time, therefore, seems to have
arrived when their affiliation can be pointed out, if it ever can be,
and the study of architecture may be raised from dry details of
measurements to the dignity of an historical science.In the present work it is intended that the first two volumes shall
cover the same extent of ground as was comprised in the two volumes of
the ‘Handbook,’ as originally published, with such enlargement as is
requisite to incorporate all recent additions to our knowledge; and
chapters will be added on Celtic—or, as they are vulgarly called,
Druidical—remains omitted in the ‘Handbook.’ The ‘History of Modern
Architecture’ will thus form the third volume of the work; and when—if
ever—it comes to be reprinted, it is intended to add a Glossary of
architectural terms, and other matters necessary to complete the book.When all this is done, the work will be increased from 1500 pages, which
is the number comprised in the three volumes as at present published, to
more than 2000 pages, and the illustrations will be augmented in at
least an equal ratio.[11] Notwithstanding all this, it is too evident
that even then the work can only be considered as an introduction to the
subject, and it would require a work at least ten times as large to do
full justice even to our present knowledge of the history of
architecture.Any one at all familiar with the literature of the subject
can see at once why this is so.Viollet le Duc, for instance, is now
publishing a dictionary of French architecture from the eleventh to the
sixteenth century.The work will consist, when complete, of ten volumes,
and probably 5000 illustrations.Yet even this will by no means exhaust
the history of the style in one country of Europe during the five
centuries indicated.It would require at least as many volumes to
illustrate, even imperfectly, the architectural history of England
during the same period.Germany would fill an equal number; and the
mediæval architecture of Italy and Spain could not be described in less
space.In other words, fifty volumes and 20,000 woodcuts would barely suffice
to complete what must in the present work be compressed into 500 pages,
with a like number of illustrations.Under these circumstances it will be easily understood that this book is
far from pretending to be a complete or exhaustive history of the art.It is neither an atlas nor a gazetteer, but simply a general map of the
architectural world, and—if I may be allowed the small joke—on
Mercator’s projection.It might with propriety be called an abridgment,
if there existed any larger history from which it could be supposed to
be abridged.At one time I intended to designate it ‘An Historical
Introduction to the Study of Architecture, considered as a Fine Art;’
but though such a title might describe correctly enough the general
scope of the work, its length is objectionable, and, like every
periphrasis, it is liable to misconstruction.The simple title of ‘History’ has therefore been adopted, under the
impression that it is entitled to such a denomination until at least
some narrative more worthy of the subject takes its place.Considering
the limits it thus became necessary to impose on the extent of the work,
it must be obvious that the great difficulty of its composition was in
the first place to compress so vast a subject into so small a compass;
and next, to determine what buildings to select for illustration, and
what to reject.It would have been infinitely easier to explain what was
necessary to be said, had the number of woodcuts been doubled.Had the
text been increased in the same ratio a great many things might have
been made clear to all, which will now, I fear, demand a certain amount
of previous knowledge on the part of my readers.To have done this,
however, would have defeated some of the great objects of the present
publication, which is intended to convey a general view of the history
and philosophy of the subject, without extending the work so as to make
it inconveniently large, or increasing the price so as to render it
inaccessible to a large number of readers.The principle consequently
that has been adopted in the selection of the illustrations is, first,
that none of the really important typical specimens of the art shall be
passed over without some such illustrations as shall render them
intelligible; and, after this, those examples are chosen which are
remarkable either for their own intrinsic merit, or for their direct
bearing in elucidation of the progress or affinities of the style under
discussion; all others being sternly rejected as irrelevant,
notwithstanding the almost irresistible temptation at times to adorn my
pages with fascinating illustrations.The reader who desires information
not bearing on the general thread of the narrative must thus have
recourse to monographs, or other special works, which alone can supply
his wants in a satisfactory manner.It may tend to explain some things which appear open to remark in the
following pages, if I allude here to a difference of opinion which has
frequently been pointed out as existing between the views I have
expressed and those generally received regarding several points of
ancient history or ethnology.I always have been aware that this
discrepancy exists; but it has appeared to me an almost inevitable
consequence of the different modes of investigation pursued.Almost all
those who have hitherto written on these subjects have derived their
information from Greek and Roman written texts; but, if I am not very
much mistaken, these do not suffice.The classic authors were very
imperfectly informed as to the history of the nations who preceded or
surrounded them; they knew very little of the archæology of their own
countries, and less of their ethnography.So long, therefore, as our
researches are confined to what they had written, many important
problems remain unsolved, and must ever remain as unsolvable as they
have hitherto proved.My conviction is, that the lithic mode of investigation is not only
capable of supplementing to a very great extent the deficiencies of the
graphic method, and of yielding new and useful results, but that the
information obtained by its means is much more trustworthy than anything
that can be elaborated from the books of that early age.It does not
therefore terrify me in the least to be told that such men as Niebuhr,
Cornewall Lewis, or Grote, have arrived at conclusions different from
those I have ventured to express in the following pages.Their
information is derived wholly from what is written, and it does not seem
ever to have occurred to them, or to any of our best scholars, that
there was either history or ethnography built into the architectural
remains of antiquity.While they were looking steadily at one side of the shield, I fancy I
have caught a glimpse of the other.It has been the accident of my life—I do not claim it as a merit—that I
have wandered all over the Old World.I have seen much that they never
saw, and I have had access to sources of information of which they do
not suspect the existence.While they were trying to reconcile what the
Greek or Roman authors said about nations who never wrote books, and
with regard to whom they consequently had little information, I was
trying to read the history which these very people had recorded in
stone, in characters as clear and far more indelible than those written
in ink.If, consequently, we arrived at different conclusions, it may
possibly be owing more to the sources from which the information is
derived than to any difference between the individuals who announce it.Since the invention of printing, I am quite prepared to admit that the
“litera scripta” may suffice.In an age like the present, when
nine-tenths of the population can read, and every man who has anything
to say rushes into print, or makes a speech which is printed next
morning, every feeling and every information regarding a people may be
dug out of its books.But it certainly was not so in the Middle Ages,
nor in the early ages of Greek or Roman history.Still less was this so
in Egypt, nor is it the case in India, or in many other countries; and
to apply our English nineteenth century experience to all these seems to
me to be a mistake.In those countries and times, men who had a
hankering after immortality were forced to build their aspirations into
the walls of their tombs or of their temples.Those who had poetry in
their souls, in nine cases out of ten expressed it by the more familiar
vehicle of sculpture or painting rather than in writing.To me it
appears that to neglect these in trying to understand the manners and
customs, or the history of an ancient people, is to throw away one-half,
and generally the most valuable half, in some cases the whole, of the
evidence bearing on the subject.So long as learned men persist in
believing that all that can be known of the ancient world is to be found
in their books, and resolutely ignore the evidence of architecture and
of art, we have little in common.I consequently feel neither abashed
nor ashamed at being told that men of the most extensive book-learning
have arrived at different conclusions from myself—on the contrary, if it
should happen that we agreed in some point to which their contemporary
works did not extend, I should rather be inclined to suspect some
mistake, and hesitate to put it down.There is one other point in which I fancy misconception exists, of a
nature that may probably be more easily removed by personal explanation
than by any other means.It is very generally objected to my writings
that I neither understand nor appreciate the beauties of Gothic
architecture, and consequently criticise it with undue severity.I
regret that such a feeling should prevail, partly because it is
prejudicial to the dissemination of the views I am anxious to
promulgate, but more because at a time when in this country the
admiration of Gothic art is so nearly universal, it alienates from me
the best class of men who love the art, and prevents their co-operating
with me in the improvement of our architecture, which is the great
object which we all have at heart.If I cannot now speak of Gothic architecture with the same enthusiasm as
others, this certainly was not the case in the early part of my career
as a student of art.Long after I turned my attention to the subject, I
knew and believed in none but the mediæval styles, and was as much
astonished as the most devoted admirer of Gothic architecture could be,
when any one suggested that any other forms could be compared with it.If I did not learn to understand it then, it was not for want of earnest
attention and study.I got so far into its spirit that I thought I saw
then how better things could be done in Gothic art than had been done
either in the Middle Ages or since; and I think so now.But if it is to
be done, it must be by free thought, not by servile copying.My faith in the exclusive pre-eminence of mediæval art was first shaken
when I became familiar with the splendid remains of the Mogul and Pathan
emperors of Agra and Delhi, and saw how many beauties of even the
pointed style had been missed in Europe in the Middle Ages.My
confidence was still further weakened when I saw what richness and
variety the Hindu had elaborated not only without pointed arches, but
indeed without any arches at all.And I was cured when, after a personal
inspection of the ruins of Thebes and Athens, I perceived that at least
equal beauty could be obtained by processes diametrically opposed to
those employed by the mediæval architects.After so extended a survey, it was easy to perceive that beauty in
architecture did not reside in pointed or in round arches, in bracket
capitals or horizontal architraves, but in thoughtful appropriateness of
design and intellectual elegance of detail.I became convinced that no
form is in itself better than any other, and that in all instances those
are best which are most appropriate to the purposes to which they are
applied.So self-evident do these principles—which are the basis of the reasoning
employed in this book—appear to me, that I feel convinced that there are
very few indeed even of the most exclusive admirers of mediæval art who
would not admit them, if they had gone through the same course of
education as has fallen to my lot.My own conviction is, that the great
difference which seems to exist between my views and those of the
parties opposed to them arises almost entirely from this accident of
education.In addition to this, however, we must not overlook the fact that for
three centuries all the architects in Europe concurred in believing that
the whole of their art began and ended in copying classical forms and
details.When a reaction came, it was not, unfortunately, in the
direction of freedom; but towards a more servile imitation of another
style, which—whether better or worse in itself—was not a style of our
age, nor suited to our wants or feelings.It is perhaps not to be wondered at, that after three centuries of
perseverance in one particular groove, men should have ceased to have
any faith in the possibility of reason or originality being employed in
architectural design.As, however, I can adduce in favour of my views
3000 years of perfect success in all countries and under all
circumstances, against 300 years of absolute failure in consequence of
the copying system, though under circumstances the most favourable to
success in other respects, there seems at least an _à priori_
probability that I may be right and that the copyists may be mistaken.I may be deceiving myself, but I cannot help fancying that I perceive
signs of a reaction.Some men are becoming aware of the fact that
“archæology is not architecture,” and would willingly see something done
more reasonable than an attempt to reproduce the Middle Ages.The
misfortune is, that their enlightenment is more apt to lead to
despondency than to hope.“If,” they ask, “we cannot find what we are
looking for in our own national style, where are we to look for it?” The
obvious answer, that it is to be found in the exercise of common sense,
where all the rest of the world have found it, seems to them beside the
mark.Architecture with most people is a mystery—something different
from all other arts; and they do not see that it is and must be subject
to the same rules as they all are, and must be practised in the same
manner, if it is to be successful.Whether the nation will or will not soon awaken to the importance of
this prosaic anti-climax, one thing at least seems certain and most
hopeful.Men are not satisfied with what is doing; a restless, inquiring
spirit is abroad, and if people can only be induced to think seriously
about it, I feel convinced that they will be as much astonished at their
present admiration of Gothic town-halls and Hyde Park Albert Memorials,
as we are now at the Gothic fancies of Horace Walpole and the men of his
day.Although every possible care has been taken in selecting the best
authorities for the statements in the text of the work, as well as the
subjects for illustration, still no one acquainted with the state of the
literature of architecture will need to be told that in many branches
few materials exist for a correct description of the style, and that the
drawings which are available are frequently so inexact, and with scales
so carelessly applied, that it is impossible at times to avoid error.The plans throughout the book are on too small a scale to render any
minute errors apparent, but being drawn to a uniform scale of 100 feet
to 1 inch, or 1/1200 of the real size, they are quite sufficient as a
means of comparison, even when not mathematically correct.They suffice
to enable the reader to judge of the relative size of two buildings by a
mere inspection of the plans, as correctly as he could by seeing the
buildings themselves, without actually measuring them in all their
details.As a general rule, the sections or elevations of buildings, throughout
the book, are drawn to a scale double that of the plans, viz., 50 feet
to 1 inch, or 1/600 of the real dimensions; but, owing to the great size
of many of them, it has been found impossible to carry out this in all
instances: where it has not been effected the departure from the rule is
always noted, either below the woodcut or in the text.No lineal dimensions are quoted in the text except such as it is
believed can be relied upon, and in all instances these are reduced to
English feet.The superficial measures also in the text, like the plans,
are quite sufficient for comparison, though not to be relied upon as
absolutely correct.One great source of uncertainty as regards them is
the difficulty of knowing at times what should be included in the
building referred to.Should, for instance, the Lady Chapel at Ely be
considered an integral part of the Cathedral, or the Chapter-house at
Wells?Should the sacristies attached to Continental cathedrals be
considered as part of the church?or such semi-detached towers as the
south-western one at Bourges?What constitutes the temple at Karnac, and
how much of this belongs to the Hypostyle Hall?These and fifty other
questions occur in almost every instance which may lead two persons to
very different conclusions regarding the superficial dimensions of a
building, even without the errors inherent in imperfect materials.When either the drawing from which the woodcut is taken was without a
scale, or the scale given could not be depended upon, “No scale” has
been put under the woodcut, to warn the reader of the fact.When the
woodcut was either too large for the page, or too small to be distinct
if reduced to the usual scale, a scale of feet has been added under it,
to show that it is an exception to the rule.Capitals, windows, and details which are meant to illustrate forms or
construction, and not particular buildings, are drawn to any scale that
seemed best to express the purpose for which they are inserted; when
they are remarkable for size, or as individual examples, a scale has
been added; but this is the exception, not the rule.Every pain has been taken to secure the greatest possible amount of
accuracy, and in all instances the sources from which the woodcuts have
been taken are indicated.Many of the illustrations are from original
drawings, and of buildings never before published.I.
