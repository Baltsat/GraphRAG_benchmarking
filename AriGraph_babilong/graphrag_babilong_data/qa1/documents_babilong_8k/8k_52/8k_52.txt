They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.Sandra went to the kitchen.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.Daniel travelled to the garden.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.John went to the hallway.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.John journeyed to the garden.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Sandra travelled to the office.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.Daniel went back to the office.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

not been ten minutes in the smoke house before his wrath began to cool,
and he would have given sixpence for any way of getting out but by
begging pardon.That was a little too much just yet, and Tom stamped
with rage and shook the door; which resisted his utmost efforts to
burst.Then came the sounds without, the rushing, trampling steps, the
furious bellow, and the shout, "Run!and especially what would become of
him left alone there, with this unseen enemy perhaps coming at him next.He hunted in vain in every direction for some cranny to peep through;
and if it had been possible, would have squeezed his head up the
chimney.He shouted for help, but nobody heard him; they were all too
frightened for that.He could hear them crunching along the road,
presently; another cry, and then all was still.I'll f-fight for the
Union as m-much as you like!and at last--must it be
confessed?--the gallant Secesh finished by bursting out crying!Time passed on--of course seeming doubly long to the prisoner--and still
the boys did not return.Tom cried till he could cry no more; sniffling
desperately, and rubbing his nose violently up in the air--a proceeding
which did not ameliorate its natural bent in that direction.He really
felt thoroughly sorry, and quite ready to beg pardon as soon as the boys
should return; particularly as they had forgotten to provide the captive
with even the traditional bread and water, and dinner-time was close at
hand.While he was yet struggling between repentance and stomachache,
the welcome sound of their voices was heard.They came nearer, and then
a key was hastily applied to the fastenings of the door, and it flew
open, disclosing the Zouaves, with Freddy at the head, and Mr.Tom hung back a moment yet; then with a sudden impulse he walked toward
Freddy, saying, "I beg your pardon, Colonel; please forgive me for
insulting you; and as for the flag"--and without another word, Tom ran
toward the flag staff, and catching the long folds of the banner in both
hands, pressed them to his lips.it is your safeguard, and your countrymen's
too, if they would only believe it.Go and shake hands with him, boys;
he is in his right place now, and if ever you are tempted to quarrel
again, I am sure North and South will both remember

                            "BULL RUN!"IT is not necessary to describe the particular proceedings of the
Dashahed Zouaves during every day of their camp life.They chattered,
played, drilled, quarrelled a little once in a while, and made it up
again, eat and slept considerably, and grew sunburnt to an astonishing
degree.It was Thursday morning, the fourth of their delightful days in camp.Jerry had been teaching them how to handle a musket and charge
bayonets, until they were quite excited, and rather put out that there
was no enemy to practise on but the grasshoppers.At length, when they
had tried everything that was to be done, Harry exclaimed, "I wish,
Jerry, you would tell us a story about the wars!Something real
splendid, now; perfectly crammed with Indians and scalps and awful
battles and elegant Mexican palaces full of diamonds and gold saucepans
and lovely Spanish girls carried off by the hair of their heads!"This flourishing rigmarole, which Harry delivered regardless of stops,
made the boys shout with laughter."You'd better tell the story yourself, since you know so much about
it!""I allow you've never been in Mexico, sir," said Jerry, grinning.Daniel went to the bedroom."I
doubt but thar's palisses somewhar in Mexico, but I and my mates hev
been thar, an' _we_ never seed none o' 'em.No, Master Harry, I can't
tell ye sich stories as that, but I do mind a thing what happened on the
field afore Monterey."The boys, delightedly exclaiming, "A story!drew their
camp stools around him; and Jerry, after slowly rubbing his hand round
and round over his bristling chin, while he considered what to say
first, began his story as follows:


JERRY'S STORY."It wor a Sunday night, young genl'men, the 21st
          of September, and powerful hot.We had been
          fightin' like mad, wi' not a moment's rest, all
          day, an' now at last wor under the canwas, they of
          us as wor left alive, a tryin' to sleep.The
          skeeters buzzed aroun' wonderful thick, and the
          groun' aneath our feet wor like red-hot tin
          plates, wi' the sun burnin' an blisterin' down.At
          last my mate Bill says, says he, 'Jerry, my mate,
          hang me ef I can stan' this any longer.Let you
          an
