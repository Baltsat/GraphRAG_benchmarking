Let him take you to
your Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert
House when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I
won't pry into your heart, honey.I
like the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father's hand and held
its fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned's
voice rose in the still evening air."Sposin' I was to go to N' Orleans an' take sick and die,
     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter's
bandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain't ramshacked de premises fo' you
bof.De co'n bread's gittin' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her
little leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had
found a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and
there she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his
hand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard
his firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST

We are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is
approaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no
Christmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.Mary travelled to the office.The brown river, excited by rains,
whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was
crisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless
spirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent
hold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled
by a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue
uniform.Rain nor heat nor
tempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was
left of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,
and the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers
and teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater
Mississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled
iron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had
never before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal
citizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the
city.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses
and slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid
down certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave
out his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of
speculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The
speculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the
bales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under
Pharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than
their descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours
materially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which
cost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.John travelled to the garden.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came
to a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,
were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and
men,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and
thither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with
naval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river's bank watched the pillar of smoke
fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the
Commander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is
America."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers'
cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of
the torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted
two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in
the morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's
highway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose
a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have
delighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the
Mississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the
Parrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;
no snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon
and foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,
past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past
long-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of
a home.It spread out by brigade
and division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling
through the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts
began to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a
narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the
bank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their
heads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn
hands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with
shells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back
through the forests on that short winter's afternoon, dragging their
wounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in
the solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack
and repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which
tore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in
thick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his
lips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral's gunboat that night, but when
he returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of
officers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused
at a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning
jack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,
a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket
from Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army
core, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went
off to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a
self-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took
command.He smoked incessantly in his
cabin.He had look in his face that
boded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted
as nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to
Vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the
city, on the pasty mud behind the levee's bank were dumped Sherman's
regiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might
arrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of
the batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing
off stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the
branches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept
by inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of
Vicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the
batteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of
saws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news
of an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with
caps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and
the snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little
fighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the
detachment put off in the little 'Diligence' and 'Silver Wave'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and
cottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments
went by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General
Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with
their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the
Rebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon
waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently
the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black
Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a
second detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were
heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until
the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws
stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day
the General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in
a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered
among the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o'clock Saturday morning when
the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,
bedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a
young lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of
tobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the
Admiral--"

The General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper
which he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff
officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith
and all men here across creek to relief at once.I'll take canoe through
bayou to Hill's and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You're not going through that sewer in a
canoe without an escort!""I guess they won't look for a needle in that haystack," the General
answered."Get back to your
regiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that
followed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he
thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black
labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue
of the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman
himself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them
on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the
little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's
reply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the
boat holds together, General."The boughs hammered
at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell
like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a
half.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his
hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep
backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their
heads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found
a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the
day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing
further the stream below the fleet."The Admiral's in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet
the General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move
backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from
the cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on
the right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads
with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How
Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a
memorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny
horse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of
that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the
drops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on
the deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he
rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose
daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly
the only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,
did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass
in his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the
swamp?"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain
wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name
is Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at
Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat
from St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and
astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer
the way to General Sherman's headquarters.The officer, who was greatly
impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge
which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house
up to its first floor in the backwaters.Sandra went to the hallway.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn't Brinsmade.Come right in, come
right in and take dinner.I'll send
and tell Grant you're here.Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your
friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of
fever and bad food long ago.""I guess a
good many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I've come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses
are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly
the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the
two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The
General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in
the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their
faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond
them."That's poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They
tell me he can't live," and "That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish
some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep
well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no
peace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole
corps on duty to watch him."As long as
I live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed
inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our
churches.""I guess that's so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on
him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have
you ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may
remember talking to him one evening at my house."He
paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,
when Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,
for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone
and gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked
Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He
has spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go
to war.The first thing I hear of
him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his
cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter
to sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company
on the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I
shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he
swept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge
leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him
to report here at once.Brice's company were swinging axes when the
orderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his
boot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he
gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his
clothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room
where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,
smoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the
table.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced
on the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,
as always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was
tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small
wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in
Sherman.The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice,
somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man
says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly
over him as he added:

"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head
to heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,
and Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that
formal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be
rejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her
well, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which
your mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he
deplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,
but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his
little room.We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother,
to stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss
Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at
the mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored
for it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her
father's before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The
thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely
sweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I
should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite
me.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,
and--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very
curious expression, spoke up."That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to
Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the
package from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,
the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who
should come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a
cracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I
think you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted
it."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I've been
thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round
and talk it over with you first.That isn't strictly according to
the rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I
remember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways
What was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him
a lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting
me on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort
Henry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned
forward."And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come
into this war, let me know.'Then he said gravely, but with just a
suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you
wouldn't be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's
shoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn't."A STRANGE MEETING

The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure
turned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the
history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither
for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise
with equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work
gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And
by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and
suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports
swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the
sound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a
base--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the
country clear of forage.Confederate generals in
Mississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen
Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on
a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one
talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile
of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that
seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain
Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not
changed a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,
artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their
plaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where
the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by
the rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias
and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,
save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood
tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out
below.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous
repulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs
into the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army
settled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that
narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold
agonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring
back what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks
beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big
shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could
be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of
smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and
deepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of
blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along
the rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her
vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants
disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down
the trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the
ground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the
narrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps
were so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and
the other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,
sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white
side of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were
indulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses
rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who
replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens
of Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the
Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour
of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files
wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the
enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the
Jackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle
crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not
the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was
the stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were
dimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot
blast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of
shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as
arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty
thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the
crater's edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran
across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon
tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on
a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at
Vicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the
Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old
into the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she
had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think
or care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting
of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner
biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and
gone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war
does not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg
surrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See
the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds
of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the
blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms
are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when
the counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for
months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk.Mary went back to the bedroom.The
coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke
quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a
wistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man
as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday
of their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General
Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter
from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from
afar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its
face blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old
four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the
tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the
foot.So much for one of the navy's shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was
acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and
with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her
his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him
good by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money
from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that
he might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that
he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your
way.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long
mustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,
"you've brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we'd
been fo'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of
himself.He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his
attempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack
of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He
wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so
that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen's rank, "so we won't qua'l as to
who's host heah.One thing's suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I've been
heah longest
