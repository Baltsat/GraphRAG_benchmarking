With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.John travelled to the kitchen.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.Mary journeyed to the bathroom.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.Mary moved to the kitchen.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.John went back to the office.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.John moved to the bathroom.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.Sandra went back to the garden.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.Mary went to the hallway.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was
