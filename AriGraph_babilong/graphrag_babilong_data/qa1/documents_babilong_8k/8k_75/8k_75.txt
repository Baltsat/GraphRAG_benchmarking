And she didn't object to this trip to-day.Of
course, as she said herself, it isn't as if you were young, or at all
wild."In spite of himself, K. was rather startled.He felt old enough, God
knew, but he had always thought of it as an age of the spirit.How old
did this child think he was?"I have promised to stay on, in the capacity of watch-dog,
burglar-alarm, and occasional recipient of an apostle spoon in a dish of
custard.Lightning-conductor, too--your mother says she isn't afraid of
storms if there is a man in the house.He rose to his feet and threw
back his fine shoulders."Aunt Harriet and your mother and Christine and her husband-to-be,
whatever his name is--we'll be a happy family.But, I warn you, if I
ever hear of Christine's husband getting an apostle spoon--"

She smiled up at him."You are looking very grand to-day.But you have
grass stains on your white trousers.The messages of
Pierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding
their arrival the various offices had all the type of every
description distributed and all the printers who could possibly be
procured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming
message.It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to
the foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified
to be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle.One
year one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would
surprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In
the city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the
mail coach, and expected to return to St.Paul three or four hours in
advance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage
over his competitors.Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the
stage left Chicago the message was delivered in St.Paul twenty-four
hours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian
had the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the
complete message, long before he returned to St.The management
always provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first
out with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos
to fully recover from its effect.*       *       *       *       *

As an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at
this time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that
in the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and
Sayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic
national convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats
were in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated
for president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on
the way from the boat landing to the office would be: "Anything from
the prize fight?*       *       *       *       *

"The good old times" printers often talk about were evidently not the
years between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the
Civil war in 1861.Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to
speak of.When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it
would be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with
a new Bank Note Reporter.Married men considered themselves very
fortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a
grocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single
men seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash.That was not more than
half enough to pay their board bill.This state of affairs continued
until the Press was started in 1861, when Gov.Marshall inaugurated
the custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every
Saturday night.*       *       *       *       *

Another instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily
paper of that day:

During the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and
politicians visited St.Paul, consisting of State Senator W.H.John moved to the hallway.Senator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, Senator Nye, Gen.Stewart
L. Woodford and several others of lesser celebrity.The party came to
Minnesota in the interest of the Republican candidate for president.Seward made a great speech from the front steps of the old
capitol, in which he predicted that at some distant day the capitol
of this great republic would be located not far from the Falls of St.There was a large gathering at the capitol to hear him, but
those who were not fortunate enough to get within sound of his voice
had to wait until the New York Herald, containing a full report of
his speech, reached St.Paul before they could read what the great
statesman had said.*       *       *       *       *

In the fall of 1860 the first telegraph line was completed to St.Newspaper proprietors thought they were then in the world, so
far as news is concerned, but it was not to be so.The charges for
telegraph news were so excessive that the three papers in St.Paul
could not afford the luxury of the "latest news by Associated Press."The offices combined against the extortionate rates demanded by the
telegraph company and made an agreement not to take the dispatches
until the rates were lowered; but it was like an agreement of the
railroad presidents of the present day, it was not adhered to.The
Pioneer made a secret contract with the telegraph company and left the
Minnesotian and the Times out in the cold.Of course that was a very
unpleasant state of affairs and for some time the Minnesotian and
Times would wait until the Pioneer was out in the morning and would
then set up the telegraph and circulate their papers.One of the
editors connected with the Minnesotian had an old acquaintance in the
pressroom of the Pioneer, and through him secured one of the first
papers printed.This had been going on for some time when Earle S.
Goodrich, the editor of the Pioneer, heard of it, and he accordingly
made preparation to perpetrate a huge joke on the Minnesotian.Goodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five
columns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies
of the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian.Amongst the bogus news was a two-column
speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate
just previous to the breaking out of the war.Seward's well-known
ideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not
questioned.The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting
to be from the then excited Southern States.The Minnesotian received
a Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition
was distributed throughout the city.I had distributed the Minnesotian
throughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to
Bridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for
being so late.As soon as I learned what
had happened I did not do either.The best of the joke was, the Times
could not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus
news from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to
circulate when they heard of the sell.They at once set up the genuine
news and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the
Minnesotian for being so easily taken in.*       *       *       *       *

The Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was
started, on the 1st of January, 1861.Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another
hitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain
its telegraph from proof sheets of the St.Anthony Falls News, a paper
published in what is now East Minneapolis.Marshall was very much
exercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph
news, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he
had a very stormy interview with Mr.No one ever knew exactly
what he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic
reports, and has had ever since.*       *       *       *       *

Gov.When the first battle of Bull Run
occurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory.I
remember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper
as a young kitten.After the circus was out I went back to the office
to see if any late news had been received.Marshall at the
door, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the
Union force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the
country would never recover from it.But it did, and the governor
was afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his
country's honor.Sandra moved to the hallway.*       *       *       *       *

Printers were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for
"three hundred thousand more" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that
it was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a
respectable appearance.The Press advertised for anything that could
set type to come in and help it out.I remember one man applying
who said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical
knowledge of the business.One evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the
late T.M.John went to the bathroom.Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and
told the foreman he thought he could help him out.He was given a
piece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.Sandra moved to the kitchen.He was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems.Metcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the
city over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press.The old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining
until the paper was up.*       *       *       *       *

Although Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any
other state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was
necessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population
was largely foreign.The feeling against the draft was very bitter,
and the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did
not take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they
did not espouse.A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from
the fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur.Arrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as
possible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take
place on the day designated by the war department.This situation
of affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following
characteristic reply was received: "If the draft cannot take place, of
course it cannot take place.The
bitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the
old St.Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous
prosecution of the war.Threats were made to mob the office.A company
was organized for self-defense, and Capt.Otis, now of West
Superior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post
commander.Otis had seen service in the early part of the war
and the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine
military man for a leader.The office was barricaded, fifteen old
Springfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought down from
the capitol and every one instructed what to do in case of an attack.I slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building
overlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my
bed.I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the
employes had gone home.As there was no possible avenue of escape in
case of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed
poor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard.The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place
without interruption.*       *       *       *       *

Before and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage
of all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following
Christmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July
and Thanksgiving.On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made
arrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third
and Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert.It happened
that on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had
occurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg.The
Pioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra
on that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself.The news of these two great events had become pretty generally known
throughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was
simply intense.The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not
propose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had
been received.A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press
office, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories.I had
helped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the
press room.As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed
I attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale.As I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the
counting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had
become so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that
direction, and undertook to retreat and try another route.But quicker
than a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and
walked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what
few papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out.As soon as the
magnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air,
and cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a
noise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St.Paul had
celebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history.*       *       *       *       *

I arrived in St.Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and
Immediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo.W. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper.I had not been at
work long before I learned what a "scoop" was.Congress had passed
a bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no
telegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three
days for the news to reach the state.The Pioneer, Minnesotian and
Times were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening
before.It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was
brought to St.Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of
the Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same
on the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers.Daniel went to the office.The
Minnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers
and they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise.It
was not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining
news and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter.I could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops
'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860.*       *       *       *       *

During the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to
expand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of
our rapidly increasing population.Mary went to the hallway.The various papers were printed on
single-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were
introduced.In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the
city, printing four pages at one time.In 1880 the different offices
introduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines
were installed.John journeyed to the kitchen.The next great advance will probably be some system of
photography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer
and proofreader.THE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION.EARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST
ATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS."Right this way for the Winslow
house!""Merchants hotel
on the levee!"These were the
announcements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would
alight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith,
Dubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling
by steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper
Mississippi.Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house,
the Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western
house, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years
attracted the attention of the visitor, and many others.The Merchants
is the only one left, and that only in name.Messengers from newspaper
offices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants
looking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and
the ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims,
were among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the
arrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected.At one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily
line to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St.Louis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river.Does any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the
combination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the
little Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the
Denmark?The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and
when any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as
a major general of the regulars.It was no uncommon sight to see six
or eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance
presented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time.The
first boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage,
and as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an
effort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible.Traveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant,
but it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the
winter.Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough
goods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive
to ship goods by express during the winter.Occasionally some
enterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing
through the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express
a new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters.The
stages on most of the routes left St.Paul at 4 o'clock in the
morning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty
miles of the city could read the news as early as they can during
these wonderful days of steam and electricity.*       *       *       *       *

Probably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much
interest as the one known as the "Five Million Loan Election."It was
not a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it;
although the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it
at a later period.The only paper of any prominence that opposed the
passage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr.That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who
favored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an
opposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor.The
great panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business
of every description and it was contended that the passage of this
measure would give employment to thousands of people; that the
rumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the
state, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be
able to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a
few dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by
any ordinary methods of speculation.The campaign was short and the
amendment carried by an immense majority.So nearly unanimous was
the sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was
extremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to
it.Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a
majority of over 4,000 for the law.There was no Australian law
at that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of
molestation.One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in
opposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O.Sweeney, now
a resident of Duluth.The
newspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time.Daniel went to the garden.They
had to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers.It was
proposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to
donate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every
mile of road graded and ready to iron.Work Was commenced soon after
the passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the
railroad companies upon Gov.Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in
accordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the
state.Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of
the state had been fully protected.The railroad companies would not
accept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they
obtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they
be issued.The governor held that the supreme court had no authority
to coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the
advice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction
between the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the
mandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds.Judge Flandrau
dissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas
prevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly
improved.Sibley was sincere in his
efforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with
the same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall.Sibley was the legal
governor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign
the bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the
principal nor the interest would ever be paid.The Minnesotian carried
at the head of its columns the words "Official Paper of the City," and
it was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials,
denouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would
be construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the
people in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a
bad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds.An
effort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of
its official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to
abrogate its contract.Threats were made to throw the office into the
river, but they did not materialize.Sibley endeavored
to place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted
with conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and
humiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt.The whole railway construction scheme
suddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of
the state was compromised, "and enterprise of great pith and
moment had turned their currents awry."The evil forbodings of the
Minnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years
the repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her
otherwise spotless record.Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on
which the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to
new organizations.Pillsbury the
state compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per
cent of their nominal value.*       *       *       *       *

In the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee
between the Sioux and the Chippewas.A party of Chippewa warriors,
under the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a
body of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly
opened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty.Eight or
ten Chippewas were killed during the engagement.The daily papers
sent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that
vicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements.Among
the reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the
Eastern cities.He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and
furnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of
the preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable
to find out the "origin of the difficulty."As the Sioux and
Chippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded
considerable amusement to the old inhabitants.*       *       *       *       *

The celebration in St.Paul in honor of the successful laying of the
Atlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858,
was one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations
that ever occurred in the city.The announcement of the completion of
the enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did
not reach St.Paul until two or three days later, as there was no
telegraphic communication to the city at that time.As soon as
messages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President
Buchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand
celebration.Most of the cities throughout the United States were
making preparations to celebrate on that day, and St.Paul did not
propose to be outdone.The city council appropriated several hundred
dollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination.An
elaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit
to the city at the present time marched through the principal streets,
to the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and
surrounding country.To show that a procession in the olden time was
very similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of
procession is appended:

THE PROCESSION.Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,
    representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,
    the different States of the Union, and
    other devices.Officers and Crews of Vessels in Port.AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief,
and he was assisted by a large number of aides.The Pioneer Guards,
the oldest military company in the state, had the right of line.They
had just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the
drum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days,
presented a very imposing appearance.The Pioneer Guards were followed
by the City Guards, under Capt.A detachment of cavalry
and the City Battery completed the military part of the affair.The
fire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H.
Williams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha
Engine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was
the next in order.One of the most attractive features of the occasion
was the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company.In a large car
drawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of
printers and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several
epochs in the life of the great philosopher.In the car with the
representatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a
beautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's
theater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear.The car was ornamented with
flowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions
"Franklin," "Morse," "Field."The Pioneer book bindery was also
represented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female,
were employed in different branches of the business.These beautiful
floats were artistically designed by George H. Colgrave, who is
still in the service of the Pioneer Press company.One of the unique
features of the parade, and one that attracted great attention, was a
light brigade, consisting of a number of school children mounted, and
they acted as a guard of honor to the president and queen.In an open
barouche drawn by four horses were seated two juvenile representatives
of President Buchanan and Queen Victoria.The representative of
British royalty was Miss Rosa Larpenteur, daughter of A.L.Larpenteur,
and the first child born of white parents in St.James Buchanan
was represented by George Folsom, also a product of the city.Miles and Miss Emily Dow, the stars at the People's theater,
were in the line of march on two handsomely caparisoned horses,
dressed in Continental costume, representing George and Martha
Washington.The colonel looked like the veritable Father of His
Country.There were a number of other floats, and nearly all the
secret societies of the city were in line.The procession was nearly
two miles in length and they marched three and one-half hours before
reaching their destination.To show the difference between a line of
march at that time and one at the present day, the following is given:

THE LINE OF MARCH.Anthony street to Fort street, up Fort street to Ramsey street,
then countermarch down Fort to Fourth street, down Fourth street to
Minnesota street, up Minnesota street to Seventh street, down Seventh
street to Jackson street, up Jackson street to Eighth street, down
Eighth street to Broadway, down Broadway to Seventh street, up Seventh
street to Jackson street, down Jackson street to Third street, up
Third street to Market street.Ramsey were the orators of the
occasion, and they delivered very lengthy addresses.It had been
arranged to have extensive fireworks in the evening, but on account of
the storm they had to be postponed until the following night.It was a strange coincidence that on the very day of the celebration
the last message was exchanged between England and America.The cable
had been in successful operation about four weeks and 129 messages
were received from England and 271 sent from America.In 1866 a new
company succeeded in laying the cable which is in successful
operation to-day.Four attempts were made before the enterprise was
successful--the first in 1857, the second in 1858, the third in 1863
and the successful one in 1865.Mary travelled to the office.Cyrus W. Field, the projector of the
enterprise, received the unanimous thanks of congress, and would have
been knighted by Great Britain had Mr.Field thought it proper to
accept such honor.*       *       *       *       *

Some time during the early '50s a secret order known as the Sons of
Malta was organized in one of the Eastern states, and its membership
increased throughout the West with as much rapidity as the Vandals and
Goths increased their numbers during the declining years of the Roman
Empire.Two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a
charter from Pittesburg in 1858 and instituted a lodge in St.John went back to the hallway.Merchants, lawyers, doctors,
printers, and in fact half of the male population, was soon enrolled
in the membership of the order.There was something so grand, gloomy
and peculiar about the initiation that made it certain that as soon
as one victim had run the gauntlet he would not be satisfied until
another one had been procured.When a candidate had been proposed for
membership the whole lodge acted as a committee of investigation,
and if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his
dealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when
being examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the
order--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from
the manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had
been removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that
his confession had been made to the full membership of the order.Occasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a
transgresser than his questioners had anticipated.The following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for
admission: Grand Commander to candidate, "Are you in favor of
the acquisition of the Island of Cuba?"Grand
Commander, "In case of an invasion of
