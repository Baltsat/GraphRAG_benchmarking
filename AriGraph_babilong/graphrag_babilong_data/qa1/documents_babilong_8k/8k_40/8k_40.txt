At first they rented rooms and had the use of the kitchen in a house on
Concord Avenue, near the observatory.But their landlady proving to be a
woman of bad character, after eight or nine months they moved to a
tenement house near North Avenue, where they lived a year.Here they
sub-let one of their rooms to a German pack-peddler, a thrifty man,
free-thinker and socialist, who was attracted to Mrs.He used to argue with her, and to read to her from
his books, until finally she refused to listen to his doctrines,
whereupon he got very angry, paid his rent, and left.One American feels himself as good as another—if not better—especially
when brought up in a new community.But Cambridge was settled long ago,
and social distinctions are observed there.It was rather exasperating
to Asaph Hall and his wife to be snubbed and ignored and meanly treated
because they were poor and without friends.Even their grocer seemed to
snub them, sending them bad eggs.You may be sure they quit him
promptly, finding an honest grocer in Cambridgeport, a Deacon Holmes.Relieved of petty social cares
and distractions a man can work.Hall, writing to her sister Mary,
February 4, 1859, declared her husband was “getting to be a _grand_
scholar”:

   .... A little more study and Mr.Hall will be excelled by few in
    this country in his department of science.Indeed that is the case
    now, though he is not very widely known yet.In another letter, dated December 15, 1858, she wrote:

    People are beginning to know something of Mr.Hall’s worth and
    ability.May 4, 1858 she wrote:

    Mr.Hall has just finished computing the elements of the orbit of
    one [a comet] which have been published neatly in the _Astronomical
    Journal_.B. A. Gould, editor of the Journal, became acquainted with
the young astronomer who was afterward his firm friend and his associate
in the National Academy of Sciences.Merit wins recognition—recognition of the kind which is worth while.It
was not many months before the Halls found friends among quiet,
unassuming people, and formed friendships that lasted for life.It was
worth much to become acquainted with Dr.Sandra moved to the kitchen.In a letter of February 4, 1859, already cited, Mrs.Hall and I have both had some nice presents this winter,” and she
mentions a Mrs.Pritchett, an astronomer clergyman from Missouri, was the father of Dr.Henry S. Pritchett, a recent president of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.John travelled to the kitchen.Hall had given him some assistance in his studies; and
twenty years afterward Henry S. Pritchett, the son, became a member of
the Hall family.“We are having a holiday,” wrote Mrs.Hall, on the first May-day spent
in Cambridge; “the children are keeping May-day something like the old
English fashion.It is a beautiful day, the warmest we have had this
spring.Got some dandelions, and
blossoms of the soft maple.Have made quite a pretty bouquet.” The tone
of morbidness was beginning to disappear from her letters, for her
health was improving.Her religious views were growing broader and more
reasonable, also.Too poor to rent a pew in any of the churches, she and
her husband attended the college chapel, where they heard the Rev.In the following poem, suggested by one of his sermons, she
seems to embody the heroic experience of those early days in Cambridge:

                   “THE MOUNTAINS SHALL BRING PEACE.”

         O grand, majestic mountain!far extending
             In height, and breadth, and length,—
         Fast fixed to earth yet ever heavenward tending,
             Calm, steadfast in thy strength!Type of the Christian, thou; his aspirations
             Rise like thy peaks sublime.The rocks immutable are thy foundations,
             His, truths defying time.Like thy broad base his love is far outspreading;
             He scatters blessings wide,
         Like the pure springs which are forever shedding
             Sweet waters down thy side.“The mountains shall bring peace,”—a peace transcending
             The peace of sheltered vale;
         Though there the elements ne’er mix contending,
             And its repose assail,

         Yet ’tis the peace of weakness, hiding, cow’ring;—
             While thy majestic form
         In peerless strength thou liftest, bravely tow’ring
             Above the howling storm.And there thou dwellest, robed in sunset splendor,
             Up ’mid the ether clear,
         Midst the soft moonlight and the starlight tender
             Of a pure atmosphere.So, Christian soul, to thy low states declining,
             There is no peace for thee;
         Mount up!where the calm heavens are shining,
             Win peace by victory!What giant forces wrought, O mount supernal!Back in the early time,
         In building, balancing thy form eternal
             With potency sublime!O soul of mightier force, thy powers awaken!Build thou foundations which shall stand unshaken
             When heaven and earth shall flee.thy heart with earthquake shocks was rifted,
             With red fires melted through,
         And many were the mighty throes which lifted
             Thy head into the blue.Let Calv’ry tell, dear Christ!the sacrificing
             By which thy peace was won;
         And the sad garden by what agonizing
             The world was overcome.throughout thy grand endeavor
             Pray not that trials cease!’Tis these that lift thee into Heaven forever,
             The Heaven of perfect peace.The young astronomer and his Wife used
to attend the Music Hall meetings in Boston, where Sumner, Garrison,
Theodore Parker, and Wendell Phillips thundered away.On one occasion,
after Lincoln’s election, Phillips spoke advocating disunion.The crowd
was much excited, and threatened to mob him.“Hurrah for old Virginny!”
they yelled.Phillips was as calm as a Roman; but it was necessary to
form a body-guard to escort him home.Asaph Hall was a six-footer, and
believed in fair play; so he joined the little knot of men who bore
Phillips safely through the surging crowd.In after years he used to
tell of Phillips’ apparent unconcern, and of his courteous bow of thanks
when arrived at his doorstep.Angeline Hall had an adventure no less interesting.She became
acquainted with a shrewd old negress, called Moses, who had helped many
slaves escape North, stirring up mobs, when necessary, to free the
fugitives from the custody of officers.One day she went with Moses to
call upon the poet Lowell.Was glad to have
a chat with the old woman, and smilingly asked her if it did not trouble
her conscience to resist the law.Moses was ready to resist the law
again, and Lowell gave her some money.Superstitious people hailed the advent of Donati’s comet as a sign of
war—and Angeline Hall was yet to mourn the loss of friends upon the
battlefield.But hoping for peace and loving astronomy, she published
the following verses in a local newspaper:

                            DONATI’S COMET.O, not in wrath but lovingly,
                  In beauty pure and high,
                Bright shines the stranger visitant,
                  A glory in our sky.No harbinger of pestilence
                  Nor battle’s fearful din;
                Then open wide, ye gates of heaven,
                  And let the stranger in.It seems a spirit visible
                  Through some diviner air,
                With burning stars upon her brow
                  And in her shining hair.Through veil translucent, luminous
                  Shines out her starry face,
                And wrapped in robes of light she glides
                  Still through the silent space.Sandra journeyed to the office.And fill till it o’errun
                Thy silver horn thou ancient moon,
                  From fountains of the sun!But open wide the golden gates
                  Into your realm of Even,
                And let the angel presence pass
                  In glory through the heaven.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XII.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.––––––
                           LOVE IN A COTTAGE.Miss Sarah Waitt, a Cambridge school-teacher of beautiful character, and
firm friend of Angeline Hall, once said, after an acquaintance of thirty
years or more, that she had never known of a happier married life than
that of Mr.He opposed his wife’s writing
poetry—not from an aversion to poetry, but because poetry inferior to
the best is of little value.The wife, accustomed as an invalid to his
thoughtful attentions, missed his companionship as health returned.What
were her feelings the first night she found herself obliged to walk home
alone!But thereafter, like a more consistent apostle of woman’s rights,
she braved the night alone wherever duty led.She undertook to help her
husband in his computations, but, failing to persuade him that her time
was worth as much as his, she quit work.He could, indeed, compute much
faster than she, but she feelingly demanded a man’s wages.However, this labor trouble subsided without resort to boycott.The most
serious quarrel—and for a time it was very dreadful—arose in this way:

It is well known that Boston is the intellectual and moral centre of the
country, in fact of the world; the hub of the universe, as it were.There in ancient times witchcraft and the Quaker superstition were
gently but firmly discouraged (compare _Giles Corey_, Longfellow’s fine
drama, long since suppressed by Boston publishers).There in modern
times descendants of the Puritans practice race-suicide and Irishmen
practice politics.There a white man is looked upon as the equal of a
<DW64>, though somewhat inferior, in many ways, to the Boston woman.Now
it so happened that some Boston and Cambridge ladies of Angeline Hall’s
acquaintance had resolved beyond equivocation that woman should
thenceforth be emancipated from skirts.Hall, in college days, had worn the “bloomer” costume.So they very
generously suggested that she have the honor of inaugurating bloomers in
Boston and vicinity.Truly it showed a self-sacrificing spirit on the
part of these ladies to allow this comparatively unknown sister to reap
the honor due her who should abolish skirts.They would not for one
moment think of robbing her of this honor by donning bloomers
themselves.They could only suggest that the reform be instituted
without delay, and they were eager to see how much the Boston public
would appreciate it.He reminded his wife that they were just struggling
to their feet, and the bloomers might ruin their prospects.A pure-minded woman to be interfered with in this manner!And worse than that, to think that she had married a coward!“A
coward”—yes, that is what she called him.It so happened, shortly
afterward, that the astronomer, returning home one night, found his wife
by the doorstep watching a blazing lamp, on the point of explosion.He
stepped up and dropped his observing cap over the lamp.Whereupon she
said, “You _are_ brave!” Strange she had not noticed it before!Asaph Hall used to aver that a family quarrel is not always a bad thing.Could he have been thinking of his
own experience?It is possible that the little quarrels indicated above
led to a clearer understanding of the separate duties of husband and
wife, and thence to a division of labor in the household.The secret of
social progress lies in the division of labor.And the secret of success
and great achievement in the Hall household lay in the division of
labor.Hall confined his attention to astronomy,
and Mrs.The world gained a worthy
astronomer.Did it lose a reformer-poetess?But it was richer
by one more devoted wife and mother.From the spring of 1859 to the end of their stay in Cambridge, that is,
for three years, the Halls occupied the cozy little Bond cottage, at the
top of Observatory Hill.Back of the cottage they had a vegetable
garden, which helped out a small salary considerably.There in its
season they raised most delicious sweet corn.In the dooryard, turning
an old crank, was a rosy-cheeked little boy, who sang as he turned:

                         Julee, julee, mem, mem,
                         Julee, julee, mem, mem;

then paused to call out:

“Mama, don’t you like my sweet voice?”

Asaph Hall, Jr., was born at the Bond cottage, October 6, 1859.If we
may trust the accounts of his fond mother, he was a precocious little
fellow—played bo-peep at four months—weighed twenty-one pounds at six
months, when he used to ride out every day in his little carriage and
get very rosy—took his first step at fourteen months, when he had ten
teeth—was quite a talker at seventeen months, when he tumbled down the
cellar stairs with a pail of coal scattered over him—darned his stocking
at twenty-six months, and demanded that his aunt’s letter be read to him
three or four times a day—at two and a half years trudged about in the
snow in his rubber boots, and began to help his mother with the
housework, declaring, “I’m big enough, mama.” “Little A.” was a general
favorite.He fully enjoyed a clam bake, and was very fond of oranges.One day he got lost, and his terrified mother thought he might have
fallen into a well.But he was found at last on his way to Boston to buy
oranges.Love in a cottage is sweeter and more prosperous when the cottage stands
a hundred miles or more from the homes of relatives.How can wife cleave
unto husband when mother lives next door?And how can husband prosper
when father pays the bills?It was a fortunate piece of hard luck that
Angeline Hall saw little of her people.Daniel travelled to the garden.John moved to the hallway.As it was, her sympathy and
interest constantly went out to mother and sisters.In one she threatened to rescue her mother from the irate
Mr.Woodward by carrying her off bodily to Cambridge.By others it
appears that she was always in touch with her sisters Ruth and Mary.Indeed, during little A.’s early infancy Mary visited Cambridge and
acted as nurse.In the summer of 1860, little A. and his mother visited
Rodman.Charlotte Ingalls was on from the West, also, and there was a
sort of family reunion.Charlotte, Angeline and Ruth, and their cousins
Huldah and Harriette were all mothers now, and they merrily placed their
five babies in a row.In the fall of the same year Angeline visited her aunts, Lois and
Charlotte Stickney, who still lived on their father’s farm in Jaffrey,
New Hampshire.The old ladies were very poor, and labored in the field
like men, maintaining a pathetic independence.Angeline was much
concerned, but found some comfort, no doubt, in this example of Stickney
grit.She had found her father’s old home, heard his story from his
sisters’ lips, learned of the stalwart old grandfather, Moses Stickney;
and from that time forth she took a great interest in the family
genealogy.In 1863 she visited Jaffrey again, and that summer ascended
Mt.Just twenty-five years afterward,
accompanied by her other three sons, she camped two or three weeks on
her grandfather’s farm; and it was my own good fortune to ascend the
grand old mountain with her.Great white
clouds lay against the blue sky in windrows.At a distance the rows
appeared to merge into one great mass; but on the hills and fields and
ponds below the shadows alternated with the sunshine as far as eye could
reach.There beneath us lay the rugged land whose children had carried
Anglo-Saxon civilization westward to the Pacific.Moses Stickney’s farm
was a barren waste now, hardly noticeable from the mountain-top.Lois
and Charlotte had died in the fall of 1869, within a few days of each
other.House and barn had disappeared, and the site was marked by
raspberry bushes.We drew water from the old well; and gathered the dead
brush of the apple orchard, where our tent was pitched, to cook our
victuals.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             CHAPTER XIII.––––––
                     WASHINGTON AND THE CIVIL WAR.Many an obscure man of ability was raised to prominence by the Civil
War.So it was with the astronomer, Asaph Hall.A year after the war
broke out, the staff of workers at the U.S.Some resigned to go South; others were ordered elsewhere by
the Federal Government.In the summer of 1862, while his wife was
visiting her people in Rodman, Mr.Hall went to Washington, passed an
examination, and was appointed an “Aid” in the Naval Observatory.On August 27, three weeks after he entered
the observatory, Mr.Hall wrote to his wife:

    When I see the slack, shilly-shally, expensive way the Government
    has of doing everything, it appears impossible that it should ever
    succeed in beating the Rebels.He soon became disgusted at the wire-pulling in Washington, and wrote
contemptuously of the “_American_ astronomy” then cultivated at the
Naval Observatory.But he decided to make the best of a bad bargain; and
his own work at Washington has shed a lustre on American astronomy.When he left Cambridge, thanks to his frugal wife, he had three hundred
dollars in the bank, although his salary at the Harvard Observatory was
only six hundred a year.The Bonds hated to lose him, and offered him
eight hundred in gold if he would stay.This was as good as the
Washington salary of one thousand a year in paper money which he
accepted, to say nothing of the bad climate and high prices of that
city, or of the uncertainties of the war.The next three years were teeming with great events.In less than a
month after his arrival in Washington, the second battle of Bull Run was
fought.At the observatory he heard the roar of cannon and the rattle of
musketry; and it was his heart-rending task to hunt for wounded friends.His wife, still at the North, wrote under date of September 4, 1862:

    DEAREST ASAPH:... I wish I could go right on to you, I feel so
    troubled about you.You will write to me, won’t you, as soon as you
    get this, and tell me whether to come on now or not.If there is
    danger I had rather share it with you.Little A says he does not want papa to get shot.Cried about it last
    night, and put his arms round my neck.He says he is going to take
    care of mamma.To this her husband replied, September 6:

    DEAREST ANGIE: I have just got your letter.... You must not give
    yourself any uneasiness about me.I shall keep along about my
    business.We are now observing the planet Mars in the morning, and I
    work every other night.Don’t tell little A that I am going to be shot.Don’t expect
    anything of that kind.You had better take your time and visit at
    your leisure now.Things will be more settled in a couple of weeks.Fox [his room-mate at McGrawville] seems to be doing well.The
    ball is in his chest and probably lodged near his lungs.It may kill
    him, but I think not....

Observing Mars every other night, and serving Mars the rest of the time!His wife’s step-brothers Constant and Jasper Woodward were both wounded.Jasper, the best of the Woodward brothers, was a lieutenant, and led his
company at Bull Run, the captain having scalded himself slightly with
hot coffee in order to keep out of the fight.Jasper was an exceedingly
bashful fellow, but a magnificent soldier, and he fairly gloried in the
battle.When he fell, and his company broke in retreat, Constant paused
to take a last shot in revenge, and was himself wounded.Hall found
them both, Constant fretful and complaining, though not seriously
wounded, and Jasper still glorying in the fight.The gallant fellow’s
wound did not seem fatal; but having been left in a damp stone church,
he had taken cold in it, so that he died.Next followed the battle of Antietam, and the astronomer’s wife, unable
to find out who had won, and fearful lest communication with Washington
might be cut off if she delayed, hastened thither.A. J.
Warner, a McGrawville schoolmate, whose family lived with the Halls in
Georgetown, was brought home shot through the hip.To add to the trials
of the household, little A. and the colonel’s boy Elmer came down with
diphtheria.Through the unflagging care and nursing of his mother,
little A. lived.Hall, exhausted by the hot,
unwholesome climate no less than by his constant exertions in behalf of
wounded friends, broke down, and was confined within doors six weeks
with jaundice.Indeed, it was two years before he fully recovered.Strange that historians of the Civil War have not dwelt upon the
enormous advantage to the Confederates afforded by their hot, enervating
climate, so deadly to the Northern volunteer.In January, 1863, the Halls and Warners moved to a house in Washington,
on I Street, between 20th and 21st Streets, N.W.Here a third surgical
operation on the wounded colonel proved successful.Though he nearly
bled to death, the distorted bullet was at last pulled out through the
hole it had made in the flat part of the hip bone.Deceived by the
doctors before, the poor man cried: “Mr.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Is the
ball out?”

Soon after this, in March, small-pox, which was prevalent in the city,
broke out in the house, and Mr.Hall sent his wife and little boy to
Cambridge, Mass.There she stayed with her friend Miss Sarah Waitt; and
there she wrote the following letter to Captain Gillis, Superintendent
of the Naval Observatory:

                                               CAMBRIDGE, Apr.Gillis._

    DEAR SIR: I received a letter from Mr.Hall this morning saying that
    Prof.Sandra went back to the office.Hesse has resigned his place at the Observatory.If the question is one of ability, I should be more than willing
    that he with all other competitors should have a thorough and
    impartial examination.I know I should be proud of the result.If on
    the other hand the question is who has the greatest number of
    influential friends to push him forward whether qualified or
    unqualified, I fear, alas!He stands alone on his
    merits, but his success is only a question of time.I, more than any
    one, know of all his long, patient and faithful study.A few years,
    and he, like Johnson, will be beyond the help of some Lord
    Chesterfield.Hall writes me that he shall do nothing but wait.I could not
    bear not to have his name at least proposed.Truly,

                ANGELINE S. HALL.Hall wrote to his wife from Washington:

    DEAREST ANGIE: Yesterday afternoon Capt.Gillis told me to tell you
    that the best answer he could make to your letter is that hereafter
    you might address me as Prof.A. Hall....

    You wrote to Capt.Yours,

                A. HALL.Daniel travelled to the hallway.And so it was that Asaph Hall entered permanently into the service of
the United States Government.His position in life was at last secure,
and the rest of his days were devoted completely to science.His wife,
grown stronger and more self-reliant, took charge of the family affairs
and left him free to work.That summer he wrote to her, “It took me a
long time to find out what a good wife I have got.”

Some fifteen years afterward Mrs.Hall rendered a similar service to the
famous theoretical astronomer, Mr.George W. Hill, who for several years
was an inmate of her house.Hill’s rare abilities, and his
extreme modesty, Mrs.Hall took it upon herself to urge his appointment
to the corps of Professors of Mathematics, U.S.Navy, to which her
husband belonged.There were two vacancies at the time, and Mr.Hill,
having brilliantly passed a competitive examination, was designated for
appointment.But certain influences deprived the corps of the lustre
which the name of Hill would have shed upon it.In the fall of 1863 the Halls settled down again in the house on I
Street.Here the busy little wife made home as cheerful as the times
permitted, celebrating her husband’s birthday with a feast.But the I
Street home was again invaded by small-pox.Captain Fox, having been
appointed to a government clerkship, was boarding with them, when he
came down with varioloid.Hall’s sister, on a visit to
Washington, caught the small-pox from him.However, she recovered
without spreading the disease.In May, 1864, they rented rooms in a house on the heights north of the
city.Crandle, was a Southern sympathizer; but
when General Jubal A. Early threatened the city he was greatly alarmed.On the morning of July 12 firing was heard north of the city.Crandle,
with a clergyman friend, had been out very early reconnoitering, and
they appeared with two young turkeys, stolen somewhere in anticipation
of the sacking of the city.For the Confederates were coming, and the
house, owned as it was by a United States officer, would surely be
burned.A hiding place for the family had been found in the Rock Creek
valley.Hall went to his work that morning as usual; but he did not return.Hall, who was soon to give birth to another son, took little Asaph
and went in search of her husband.He was not at the observatory, but
the following note explained his absence:

                                                          July 12, 1864.DEAR ANGIE: I am going out to Fort Lincoln.Don’t know how long I
    shall stay.Keep
    cool and take good care of little A.

            Yours truly,

                A. HALL.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Hall was put in command
of workmen from the Navy Yard, who manned an intrenchment near Fort
Lincoln.Many of the men were foreigners, and some of them did not know
how to load a gun.Had the Confederates charged upon them they might
have been slaughtered like sheep.But in a day or two Union troops
arrived in sufficient force to drive Early away.Before the summer was over, the Halls moved to a house in Georgetown, on
the corner of West and Montgomery Streets.It was an old-fashioned brick
house, with a pleasant yard fenced by iron pickets.These were made of
old gun barrels, and gave the place the name of “Gunbarrel Corner.”
Here, on the 28th of September, 1864, their second child, Samuel, was
born.And here the family lived for three years, renting rooms to
various friends and relatives.Charles Kennon, whose soldier husband lost his life in the Red River
expedition, leaving her with three noble little sons.Kennon and the
Halls had been neighbors in Cambridge, where he studied at the Harvard
Divinity School.Hall had objected to having a home in Washington,
and had looked to New England as a fitter place for his family to live;
but his wife would not be separated from him.The curse of war was upon
the city.Crowded with sick and wounded soldiers, idle officers and
immoral women, it was scourged by disease.Forty cases of small-pox were
at one time reported within half a mile of the place where Mr.But people had become so reckless as to attend a ball at a
small-pox hospital.Most of the native population were Southern
sympathizers, and some of the women were very bitter.They hated all
Yankees—people who had lived upon saw-dust, and who came to Washington
to take the Government offices away from Southern gentlemen.As Union
soldiers were carried, sick and wounded, to the hospital, these women
would laugh and jeer at them.But there were people in Washington who were making history.Hall saw Grant—short, thin, and stoop-shouldered, dressed in his
uniform, a slouch hat pulled over his brow—on his way to take command of
the Army of the Potomac.That venerable patriot John Pierpont, whom she
had seen and admired at McGrawville, became attached to Mrs.Hall, and
used to dine at her house.She took her little boy to one of Lincoln’s
receptions, and one night Lincoln and Secretary Stanton made a visit to
the Naval Observatory, where Mr.Hall showed them some objects through
his telescope.At the Cambridge Observatory the Prince of Wales had once
appeared, but on that occasion the young astronomer was made to feel
less than nobody.Now the great War President, who signed his commission
in the United
