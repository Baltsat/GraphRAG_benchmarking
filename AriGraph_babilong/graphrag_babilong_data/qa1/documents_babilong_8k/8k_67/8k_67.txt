He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Mary went back to the hallway.Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Sandra moved to the bathroom.Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?Rigby therefore had, on the whole, a far from unfavourable
audience, and he availed himself of their forbearance.He brought in
his crack theme, the guillotine, and dilated so elaborately upon its
qualities, that one of the gentlemen below could not refrain from
exclaiming, 'I wish you may get it.'Rigby
what is called a great opening, which, like a practised speaker, he
immediately seized.He denounced the sentiment as 'un-English,' and got
much cheered.Excited by this success, Rigby began to call everything
else 'un-English' with which he did not agree, until menacing murmurs
began to rise, when he shifted the subject, and rose into a grand
peroration, in which he assured them that the eyes of the whole empire
were on this particular election; cries of 'That's true,' from all
sides; and that England expected every man to do his duty.'And who do you expect to do yours?'Sandra journeyed to the hallway.inquired a gentleman below,' about
that 'ere pension?''Rigby,' screeched a hoarse voice, 'don't you mind; you guv it them
well.''Rigby, keep up your spirits, old chap: we will have you.'said a stentorian voice; and a man as tall as Saul looked round
him.This was the engaged leader of the Conservative mob; the eye of
every one of his minions was instantly on him.Our young Queen and
our Old Institutions!This was a signal for the instant appearance of the leader of the
Liberal mob.Magog Wrath, not so tall as Bully Bluck, his rival, had
a voice almost as powerful, a back much broader, and a countenance far
more forbidding.'Now, my boys, the Queen and Millbank for ever!'These rival cries were the signals for a fight between the two bands of
gladiators in the face of the hustings, the body of the people little
interfering.Bully Bluck seized Magog Wrath's colours; they wrestled,
they seized each other; their supporters were engaged in mutual contest;
it appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies from
the windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed
their way through the mob; you heard their staves resounded on the
skulls of all who opposed them, especially the little boys: order was at
length restored; and, to tell the truth, the only hurts inflicted were
those which came from the special constables.Bully Bluck and Magog
Wrath, with all their fierce looks, flaunting colours, loud cheers, and
desperate assaults, were, after all, only a couple of Condottieri, who
were cautious never to wound each other.They were, in fact, a peaceful
police, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from being
mischievous who were more inclined to do harm.Their hired gangs were
the safety-valves for all the scamps of the borough, who, receiving a
few shillings per head for their nominal service, and as much drink as
they liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into peace
and sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be
apprehended.Millbank came forward: he was brief compared with Mr.Rigby; but
clear and terse.He did not favour his
hearers with any history, but gave them his views about taxes, free
trade, placemen, and pensioners, whoever and wherever they might be.'Hilloa, Rigby, about that 'ere pension?''Never mind, Rigby, you'll come in next time.'Millbank was energetic about resident representatives, but did not
understand that a resident representative meant the nominee of a great
Lord, who lived in a great castle; great cheering.There was a Lord
once who declared that, if he liked, he would return his <DW64> valet to
Parliament; but Mr.It remained
for the people of Darlford to determine whether he was mistaken.No
<DW65>s, no walets!''His language ain't as purty as the Lunnun chap's,' said a critic below;
'but he speaks from his 'art: and give me the man who 'as got a 'art.''That's your time of day, Mr.'Now, the Queen and Millbank
for ever!The show of hands was entirely in favour of Mr.Scarcely a
hand was held up for Mr.Rigby below, except by Bully Bluck and his
praetorians.The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative
Association, the Secretary, and the four agents, severally and
respectively went up to Mr.Rigby and congratulated him on the result,
as it was a known fact, 'that the show of hands never won.'The eve of polling-day was now at hand.This is the most critical period
of an election.All night parties in disguise were perambulating the
different wards, watching each other's tactics; masks, wigs, false
noses, gentles in livery coats, men in female attire, a silent carnival
of manoeuvre, vigilance, anxiety, and trepidation.The thoughtful voters
about this time make up their minds; the enthusiasts who have told you
twenty times a-day for the last fortnight, that they would get up in the
middle of the night to serve you, require the most watchful cooping; all
the individuals who have assured you that 'their word is their bond,'
change sides.Two of the Rigbyites met in the market-place about an hour after
midnight.The blunt's going like the ward-pump.I saw
a man come out of Moffatt's house, muffled up with a mask on.'You don't mean that, do you?D----e, I'll answer for Moffatt.''I never thought he was a true man.''I could not see him; but I met young Gunning and told him.''I thought he was as right as the town clock.'The enemy, Franklin and Sampson
Potts.'Well, I hope the best man will win.''You must go for Moffatt early, to breakfast at the White Lion; that's
your sort.Don't leave him, and poll him your-self.I am going off to
Solomon Lacey's.He has got four Millbankites cooped up very drunk, and
I want to get them quietly into the country before daybreak.'The candidates are roused from their slumbers at an
early hour by the music of their own bands perambulating the town, and
each playing the 'conquering hero' to sustain the courage of their jaded
employers, by depriving them of that rest which can alone tranquillise
the nervous system.There is something in that matin burst of music,
followed by a shrill cheer from the boys of the borough, the only
inhabitants yet up, that is very depressing.The committee-rooms of each candidate are soon rife with black reports;
each side has received fearful bulletins of the preceding night
campaign; and its consequences as exemplified in the morning,
unprecedented tergiversations, mysterious absences; men who breakfast
with one side and vote with the other; men who won't come to breakfast;
men who won't leave breakfast.Rigby was in a majority of twenty-eight.The polling was brisk and equal until the middle of the day, when it
became slack.Rigby kept a majority, but an inconsiderable one.Millbank's friends were not disheartened, as it was known that
the leading members of Mr.Rigby's committee had polled; whereas his
opponent's were principally reserved.At a quarter-past two there was
great cheering and uproar.The four voters in favour of Millbank, whom
Solomon Lacey had cooped up, made drunk, and carried into the country,
had recovered iheir senses, made their escape, and voted as they
originally intended.Millbank was declared by his
committee to be in a majority of one, but the committee of Mr.Rigby
instantly posted a placard, in large letters, to announce that, on the
contrary, their man was in a majority of nine.'If we could only have got another registration,' whispered the
principal agent to Mr.Rigby, at a quarter-past four.'You think it's all over, then?''Why, I do not see now how we can win.We have polled all our dead men,
and Millbank is seven ahead.''I have no doubt we shall be able to have a good petition,' said the
consoling chairman of the Conservative Association.CHAPTER V.


It was not with feelings of extreme satisfaction that Mr.The loss of Hellingsley, followed by the loss of the borough
to Hellingsley's successful master, were not precisely the incidents
which would be adduced as evidence of Mr.Rigby's good management or
good fortune.Hitherto that gentleman had persuaded the world that he
was not only very clever, but that he was also always in luck; a quality
which many appreciate more even than capacity.His reputation was
unquestionably damaged, both with his patron and his party.But what
the Tapers and the Tadpoles thought or said, what even might be the
injurious effect on his own career of the loss of this election, assumed
an insignificant character when compared with its influence on the
temper and disposition of the Marquess of Monmouth.And yet his carriage is now entering the courtyard of Monmouth House,
and, in all probability, a few minutes would introduce him to that
presence before which he had, ere this, trembled.The Marquess was at
home, and anxious to see Mr.In a few minutes that gentleman was
ascending the private staircase, entering the antechamber, and waiting
to be received in the little saloon, exactly as our Coningsby did more
than five years ago, scarcely less agitated, but by feelings of a very
different character.'Well, you made a good fight of it,' exclaimed the Marquess, in a
cheerful and cordial tone, as Mr.This reception instantly reassured the defeated candidate, though its
contrast to that which he expected rather perplexed him.He entered into
the details of the election, talked rapidly of the next registration,
the propriety of petitioning; accustomed himself to hearing his voice
with its habitual volubility in a chamber where he had feared it might
not sound for some time.'These fellows are in for this
Parliament, and I am really weary of the whole affair.I begin to think
the Duke was right, and it would have been best to have left them to
themselves.I am glad you have come up at once, for I want you.The fact
is, I am going to be married.'Rigby; he was prepared for
it, though scarcely could have hoped that he would have been favoured
with it on the present occasion, instead of a morose comment on his
misfortunes.Marriage, then, was the predominant idea of Lord Monmouth
at the present moment, in whose absorbing interest all vexations were
forgotten.Disgusted by the failure of his political
combinations, his disappointments in not dictating to the county and not
carrying the borough, and the slight prospect at present of obtaining
the great object of his ambition, Lord Monmouth had resolved to
precipitate his fate, was about to marry immediately, and quit England.'You will be wanted, Rigby,' continued the Marquess.'We must have a
couple of trustees, and I have thought of you as one.You know you are
my executor; and it is better not to bring in unnecessarily new names
into the management of my affairs.Rigby then, after all, was a lucky man.After such a succession of
failures, he had returned only to receive fresh and the most delicate
marks of his patron's good feeling and consideration.Lord Monmouth's
trustee and executor!It
ought to be blazoned in letters of gold in the most conspicuous part of
Rigby's library, to remind him perpetually of his great and impending
destiny.Lord Monmouth's executor, and very probably one of his
residuary legatees!A legatee of some sort he knew he was.What a
splendid _memento mori_!What cared Rigby for the borough of Darlford?And as for his political friends, he wished them joy of their barren
benches.Nothing was lost by not being in this Parliament.It was then with sincerity that Rigby offered his congratulations to
his patron.He praised the judicious alliance, accompanied by every
circumstance conducive to worldly happiness; distinguished beauty,
perfect temper, princely rank.Rigby, who had hardly got out of his
hustings' vein, was most eloquent in his praises of Madame Colonna.'An amiable woman,' said Lord Monmouth, 'and very handsome.I always
admired her; and an agreeable person too; I dare say a very good temper,
but I am not going to marry her.''Might I then ask who is--'

'Her step-daughter, the Princess Lucretia,' replied the Marquess,
quietly, and looking at his ring.He had been
working all this time for the wrong woman!The consciousness of being a
trustee alone sustained him.The Marquess
would not speak however, and Rigby must.He babbled rather incoherently
about the Princess Lucretia being admired by everybody; also that she
was the most fortunate of women, as well as the most accomplished; he
was just beginning to say he had known her from a child, when discretion
stopped his tongue, which had a habit of running on somewhat rashly;
but Rigby, though he often blundered in his talk, had the talent of
extricating himself from the consequence of his mistakes.'And Madame must be highly gratified by all this?'Rigby,
with an enquiring accent.Mary went back to the bedroom.He was dying to learn how she had first
received the intelligence, and congratulated himself that his absence at
his contest had preserved him from the storm.'Madame Colonna knows nothing of our intentions,' said Lord Monmouth.'And by the bye, that is the very business on which I wish to see you,
Rigby.We are to be married,
and immediately.It would gratify me that the wife of Lucretia's father
should attend our wedding.You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby; I
must have no scenes.Always happy to see the Princess Colonna under my
roof; but then I like to live quietly, particularly at present;
harassed as I have been by the loss of these elections, by all this bad
management, and by all these disappointments on subjects in which I was
led to believe success was certain.Madame Colonna is at home;' and the
Marquess bowed Mr.The departure of Sidonia from Coningsby Castle, in the autumn,
determined the Princess Lucretia on a step which had for some time
before his arrival occupied her brooding imagination.Nature had
bestowed on this lady an ambitious soul and a subtle spirit; she could
dare much and could execute finely.Above all things she coveted power;
and though not free from the characteristic susceptibility of her sex,
the qualities that could engage her passions or fascinate her fancy must
partake of that intellectual eminence which distinguished her.Though
the Princess Lucretia in a short space of time had seen much of the
world, she had as yet encountered no hero.In the admirers whom her
rank, and sometimes her intelligence, assembled around her, her master
had not yet appeared.Her heart had not trembled before any of those
brilliant forms whom she was told her sex admired; nor did she envy any
one the homage which she did not appreciate.There was, therefore, no
disturbing element in the worldly calculations which she applied to that
question which is, to woman, what a career is to man, the question of
marriage.She would marry to gain power, and therefore she wished to
marry the powerful.Lord Eskdale hovered around her, and she liked
him.She admired his incomparable shrewdness; his freedom from ordinary
prejudices; his selfishness which was always good-natured, and the
imperturbability that was not callous.But Lord Eskdale had hovered
round many; it was his easy habit.He liked clever women, young, but who
had seen something of the world.The Princess Lucretia pleased him much;
with the form and mind of a woman even in the nursery.He had watched
her development with interest; and had witnessed her launch in that
world where she floated at once with as much dignity and consciousness
of superior power, as if she had braved for seasons its waves and its
tempests.Musing over Lord Eskdale, the mind of Lucretia was drawn to the image
of his friend; her friend; the friend of her parents.There was something great in the
conception; difficult and strange.The result, if achieved, would give
her all that she desired.She concentrated her intellect on one point,
and that was to fascinate the grandfather of Coningsby, while her
step-mother was plotting that she should marry his grandson.The
volition of Lucretia Colonna was, if not supreme, of a power most
difficult to resist.There was something charm-like and alluring in the
conversation of one who was silent to all others; something in the tones
of her low rich voice which acted singularly on the nervous system.It
was the voice of the serpent; indeed, there was an undulating movement
in Lucretia, when she approached you, which irresistibly reminded you of
that mysterious animal.Lord Monmouth was not insensible to the spell, though totally
unconscious of its purpose.He found the society of Lucretia very
agreeable to him; she was animated, intelligent, original; her inquiries
were stimulating; her comments on what she saw, and heard, and read,
racy and often indicating a fine humour.But all this was reserved for
his ear.Before her parents, as before all others, Lucretia was silent,
a little scornful, never communicating, neither giving nor seeking
amusement, shut up in herself.Lord Monmouth fell therefore into the habit of riding and driving with
Lucretia alone.It was an arrangement which he found made his life more
pleasant.Nor was it displeasing to Madame Colonna.She looked upon
Lord Monmouth's fancy for Lucretia as a fresh tie for them all.Even the
Prince, when his wife called his attention to the circumstance, observed
it with satisfaction.It was a circumstance which represented in his
mind a continuance of good eating and good drinking, fine horses,
luxurious baths, unceasing billiards.In this state of affairs appeared Sidonia, known before to her
step-mother, but seen by Lucretia for the first time.Truly, he came,
saw, and conquered.Those eyes that rarely met another's were fixed upon
his searching yet unimpassioned glance.Mary went back to the garden.She listened to that voice,
full of music yet void of tenderness; and the spirit of Lucretia Colonna
bowed before an intelligence that commanded sympathy, yet offered none.Lucretia naturally possessed great qualities as well as great talents.Under a genial influence, her education might have formed a being
capable of imparting and receiving happiness.Her father offered her no love; her step-mother gained
from her no respect.Her literary education was the result of her
own strong mind and inquisitive spirit.She valued knowledge, and she
therefore acquired it.But not a single moral principle or a single
religious truth had ever been instilled into her being.Frequent
absence from her own country had by degrees broken off even an habitual
observance of the forms of her creed; while a life of undisturbed
indulgence, void of all anxiety and care, while it preserved her from
many of the temptations to vice, deprived her of that wisdom'more
precious than rubies,' which adversity and affliction, the struggles and
the sorrows of existence, can alone impart.Lucretia had passed her life in a refined, but rather dissolute society.Not indeed that a word that could call forth a maiden blush, conduct
that could pain the purest feelings, could be heard or witnessed in
those polished and luxurious circles.The most exquisite taste pervaded
their atmosphere; and the uninitiated who found themselves in those
perfumed chambers and those golden saloons, might believe, from all that
passed before them, that their inhabitants were as pure, as orderly, and
as irreproachable as their furniture.But among the habitual dwellers
in these delicate halls there was a tacit understanding, a
prevalent doctrine that required no formal exposition, no proofs and
illustrations, no comment and no gloss; which was indeed rather a
traditional conviction than an imparted dogma; that the exoteric public
were, on many subjects, the victims of very vulgar prejudices, which
these enlightened personages wished neither to disturb nor to adopt.A being of such a temper, bred in such a manner; a woman full
of intellect and ambition, daring and lawless, and satiated with
prosperity, is not made for equable fortunes and an uniform existence.She would have sacrificed the world for Sidonia, for he had touched
the fervent imagination that none before could approach; but that
inscrutable man would not read the secret of her heart; and prompted
alike by pique, the love of power, and a weariness of her present life,
Lucretia resolved on that great result which Mr.Rigby is now about to
communicate to the Princess Colonna.Rigby had entered that lady's apartments
it seemed that all the bells of Monmouth House were ringing at the same
time.The sound even reached the Marquess in his luxurious recess; who
immediately took a pinch of snuff, and ordered his valet to lock the
door of the ante-chamber.The Princess Lucretia, too, heard the sounds;
she was lying on a sofa, in her boudoir, reading the _Inferno_, and
immediately mustered her garrison in the form of a French maid, and gave
directions that no one should be admitted.Both the Marquess and
his intended bride felt that a crisis was at hand, and resolved to
participate in no scenes.Then there was another
ring; a short, hasty, and violent pull; followed by some slamming of
doors.The servants, who were all on the alert, and had advantages
of hearing and observation denied to their secluded master, caught a
glimpse of Mr.Rigby endeavouring gently to draw back into her apartment
Madame Colonna, furious amid his deprecatory exclamations.'For heaven's sake, my dear Madame; for your own sake; now really; now
I assure you; you are quite wrong; you are indeed; it is a complete
misapprehension; I will explain everything.I entreat, I implore,
whatever you like, just what you please; only listen.'Then the lady, with a mantling visage and flashing eye, violently
closing the door, was again lost to their sight.A few minutes after
there was a moderate ring, and Mr.Rigby, coming out of the apartments,
with his cravat a little out of order, as if he had had a violent
shaking, met the servant who would have entered.'Order Madame Colonna's travelling carriage,' he exclaimed in a loud
voice, 'and send Mademoiselle Conrad here directly.I don't think the
fellow hears me,' added Mr.Rigby, and following the servant, he added
in a low tone and with a significant glance, 'no travelling carriage; no
Mademoiselle Conrad; order the britska round as usual.'Nearly another hour passed; there was another ring; very moderate
indeed.The servant was informed that Madame Colonna was coming down,
and she appeared as usual.In a beautiful morning dress, and leaning on
the arm of Mr.Rigby, she descended the stairs, and was handed into her
