The middle between the convex and concave angle participates of this
increase or diminution, but in a greater or less degree as the parts
are nearer to, or farther from, the angles of the bending joints.LI./--_Of the naked Body._


/The/ members of naked men who work hard in different attitudes, will
shew the muscles more strongly on that side where they act forcibly to
bring the part into action; and the other muscles will be more or less
marked, in proportion as they co-operate in the same motion.LII./--_Of a Ligament without Muscles._


/Where/ the arm joins with the hand, there is a ligament, the largest
in the human body, which is without muscles, and is called the strong
ligament of the Carpus; it has a square shape, and serves to bind
and keep close together the bones of the arm, and the tendons of the
fingers, and prevent their dilating, or starting out.LIII./--_Of Creases._


/In/ bending the joints the flesh will always form a crease on the
opposite side to that where it is tight.LIV./--_How near behind the Back one Arm can be brought to the
other_, Plate III.John moved to the kitchen./When/ the arms are carried behind the back, the elbows can never be
brought nearer than the length from the elbow to the end of the longest
finger; so that the fingers will not be seen beyond the elbows, and
in that situation, the arms with the shoulders form a perfect square.The greatest extension of the arm across the chest is, when the elbow
comes over the pit of the stomach; the elbow and the shoulder in this
position, will form an equilateral triangle.LV./--_Of the Muscles._


/A naked/ figure being strongly marked, so as to give a distinct view
of all the muscles, will not express any motion; because it cannot
move, if some of its muscles do not relax while the others are pulling.Those which relax cease to appear in proportion as the others pull
strongly and become apparent._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.LVI./--_Of the Muscles._


/The/ muscles of the human body are to be more or less marked according
to their degree of action.Those only which act are to be shewn, and
the more forcibly they act, the stronger they should be pronounced.Those that do not act at all must remain soft and flat.LVII./--_Of the Bending of the Body._


/The/ bodies of men diminish as much on the side which bends, as they
increase on the opposite side.That diminution may at last become
double, in proportion to the extension on the other side.But of this I
shall make a separate treatise[17].LVIII./--_The same Subject._


/The/ body which bends, lengthens as much on one side as it shortens
on the other; but the central line between them will never lessen or
increase.LIX./--_The Necessity of anatomical Knowledge._


/The/ painter who has obtained a perfect knowledge of the nature of the
tendons and muscles, and of those parts which contain the most of them,
will know to a certainty, in giving a particular motion to any part of
the body, which, and how many of the muscles give rise and contribute
to it; which of them, by swelling, occasion their shortening, and which
of the cartilages they surround.He will not imitate those who, in all the different attitudes they
adopt, or invent, make use of the same muscles, in the arms, back, or
chest, or any other parts.MOTION AND EQUIPOISE OF FIGURES.LX./--_Of the Equipoise of a Figure standing still._


/The/ non-existence of motion in any animal resting on its feet, is
owing to the equality of weight distributed on each side of the line of
gravity.LXI./--_Motion produced by the Loss of Equilibrium._


/Motion/ is created by the loss of due equipoise, that is, by
inequality of weight; for nothing can move of itself, without losing
its centre of gravity, and the farther that is removed, the quicker and
stronger will be the motion._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXII./--_Of the Equipoise of Bodies_, Plate V./The/ balance or equipoise of parts in the human body is of two sorts,
viz.Simple, when a man stands upon his feet
without motion: in that situation, if he extends his arms at different
distances from the middle, or stoop, the centre of his weight will
always be in a perpendicular line upon the centre of that foot which
supports the body; and if he rests equally upon both feet, then the
middle of the chest will be perpendicular to the middle of the line
which measures the space between the centres of his feet.The complex balance is, when a man carries a weight not his own, which
he bears by different motions; as in the figure of Hercules stifling
Anteus, by pressing him against his breast with his arms, after he has
lifted him from the ground.He must have as much of his own weight
thrown behind the central line of his feet, as the weight of Anteus
adds before.LXIII./--_Of Positions._


/The/ pit of the neck, between the two Clavicles, falls perpendicularly
with the foot which bears the weight of the body.If one of the arms be
thrown forwards, this pit will quit that perpendicular; and if one of
the legs goes back, that pit is brought forwards, and so changes its
situation at every change of posture.LXIV./--_Of balancing the Weight round the Centre of Gravity in
Bodies._


/A figure/ standing upon its feet without motion, will form an
equipoise of all its members round the centre of its support.If this figure without motion, and resting upon its feet, happens to
move one of its arms forwards, it must necessarily throw as much of its
weight on the opposite side, as is equal to that of the extended arm
and the accidental weight.And the same I say of every part, which is
brought out beyond its usual balance.LXV./--_Of Figures that have to lift up, or carry any Weight._


/A weight/ can never be lifted up or carried by any man, if he do not
throw more than an equal weight of his own on the opposite side.LXVI./--_The Equilibrium of a Man standing upon his Feet_, Plate
VI./The/ weight of a man resting upon one leg will always be equally
divided on each side of the central or perpendicular line of gravity,
which supports him.LXVII./--_Of Walking_, Plate VII./A man/ walking will always have the centre of gravity over the centre
of the leg which rests upon the ground._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

[Illustration:
_Page 28_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXVIII./--_Of the Centre of Gravity in Men and Animals._


/The/ legs, or centre of support, in men and animals, will approach
nearer to the centre of gravity, in proportion to the slowness of their
motion; and, on the contrary, when the motion is quicker, they will be
farther removed from that perpendicular line.LXIX./--_Of the corresponding Thickness of Parts on each Side of
the Body._


/The/ thickness or breadth of the parts in the human body will never be
equal on each side, if the corresponding members do not move equally
and alike.LXX./--_Of the Motions of Animals._


/All/ bipeds in their motions lower the part immediately over the foot
that is raised, more than over that resting on the ground, and the
highest parts do just the contrary.This is observable in the hips and
shoulders of a man when he walks; and also in birds in the head and
rump.LXXI./--_Of Quadrupeds and their Motions._


/The/ highest parts of quadrupeds are susceptible of more variation
when they walk, than when they are still, in a greater or less degree,
in proportion to their size.This proceeds from the oblique position of
their legs when they touch the ground, which raise the animal when they
become straight and perpendicular upon the ground.LXXII./--_Of the Quickness or Slowness of Motion._


/The/ motion performed by a man, or any other animal whatever, in
walking, will have more or less velocity as the centre of their weight
is more or less removed from the centre of that foot upon which they
are supported.LXXIII./--_Of the Motion of Animals._


/That/ figure will appear the swiftest in its course which leans the
most forwards.Any body, moving of itself, will do it with more or less velocity
in proportion as the centre of its gravity is more or less removed
from the centre of its support.This is mentioned chiefly in regard
to the motion of birds, which, without any clapping of their wings,
or assistance of wind, move themselves.This happens when the centre
of their gravity is out of the centre of their support, viz.out of
its usual residence, the middle between the two wings.Because, if
the middle of the wings be more backward than the centre of the whole
weight, the bird will move forwards and downwards, in a greater or
less degree as the centre of its weight is more or less removed from
the middle of its wings.From which it follows, that if the centre of
gravity be far removed from the other centre, the descent of the bird
will be very oblique; but if that centre be near the middle of the
wings, the descent will have very little obliquity._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXIV./--_Of a Figure moving against the Wind_, Plate VIII.Daniel went back to the garden./A man/ moving against the wind in any direction does not keep his
centre of gravity duly disposed upon the centre of support[18].LXXV./--_Of the Balance of a Figure resting upon its Feet._


/The/ man who rests upon his feet, either bears the weight of his body
upon them equally, or unequally.If equally, it will be with some
accidental weight, or simply with his own; if it be with an additional
weight, the opposite extremities of his members will not be equally
distant from the perpendicular of his feet.But if he simply carries
his own weight, the opposite extremities will be equally distant from
the perpendicular of his feet: and on this subject of gravity I shall
write a separate book[19].LXXVI./--_A Precept._


/The/ navel is always in the central or middle line of the body, which
passes through the pit of the stomach to that of the neck, and must
have as much weight, either accidental or natural, on one side of the
human figure as on the other.This is demonstrated by extending the
arm, the wrist of which performs the office of a weight at the end of
a steelyard; and will require some weight to be thrown on the other
side of the navel, to counterbalance that of the wrist.It is on that
account that the heel is often raised.LXXVII./--_Of a Man standing, but resting more upon one Foot
than the other._


/After/ a man, by standing long, has tired the leg upon which he
rests, he sends part of his weight upon the other leg.But this kind
of posture is to be employed only for old age, infancy, or extreme
lassitude, because it expresses weariness, or very little power in the
limbs.For that reason, a young man, strong and healthy, will always
rest upon one of his legs, and if he removes a little of his weight
upon the other, it is only a necessary preparative to motion, without
which it is impossible to move; as we have proved before, that motion
proceeds from inequality[20].LXXVIII./--_Of the Balance of Figures_, Plate IX./If/ the figure rests upon one foot, the shoulder on that side will
always be lower than the other; and the pit of the neck will fall
perpendicularly over the middle of that leg which supports the body.The same will happen in whatever other view we see that figure, when it
has not the arm much extended, nor any weight on its back, in its hand,
or on its shoulder, and when it does not, either behind or before,
throw out that leg which does not support the body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

[Illustration:
_Page 33_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.John moved to the office.LXXIX./--_In what Manner extending one Arm alters the Balance._


/The/ extending of the arm, which was bent, removes the weight of the
figure upon the foot which bears the weight of the whole body: as is
observable in rope-dancers, who dance upon the rope with their arms
open, without any pole.LXXX./--_Of a Man bearing a Weight on his Shoulders_, Plate X./The/ shoulder which bears the weight is always higher than the other.This is seen in the figure opposite, in which the centre line passes
through the whole, with an equal weight on each side, to the leg on
which it rests.If the weight were not equally divided on each side
of this central line of gravity, the whole would fall to the ground.But Nature has provided, that as much of the natural weight of the man
should be thrown on one side, as of accidental weight on the other,
to form a counterpoise.This is effected by the man's bending, and
leaning on the side not loaded, so as to form an equilibrium to the
accidental weight he carries; and this cannot be done, unless the
loaded shoulder be raised, and the other lowered.This is the resource
with which Nature has furnished a man on such occasions.LXXXI./--_Of Equilibrium._


/Any/ figure bearing an additional weight out of the central line, must
throw as much natural or accidental weight on the opposite side as is
sufficient to form a counterpoise round that line, which passes from
the pit of the neck, through the whole mass of weight, to that part
of the foot which rests upon the ground.We observe, that when a man
lifts a weight with one arm, he naturally throws out the opposite arm;
and if that be not enough to form an equipoise, he will add as much of
his own weight, by bending his body, as will enable him to resist such
accidental load.We see also, that a man ready to fall sideways and
backwards at the same time, always throws out the arm on the opposite
side.LXXXII./--_Of Motion._


/Whether/ a man moves with velocity or slowness, the parts above the
leg which sustains the weight, will always be lower than the others on
the opposite side.LXXXIII./--_The Level of the Shoulders._


/The/ shoulders or sides of a man, or any other animal, will preserve
less of their level, in proportion to the slowness of their motion;
and, _vice versa_, those parts will lose less of their level when the
motion is quicker.This is proved by the ninth proposition, treating of
local motions, where it is said, any weight will press in the direction
of the line of its motion; therefore the whole moving towards any one
point, the parts belonging to it will follow the shortest line of the
motion of its whole, without giving any of its weight to the collateral
parts of the whole._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.LXXXIV./--_Objection to the above answered_, Plate XI./It/ has been objected, in regard to the first part of the above
proposition, that it does not follow that a man standing still, or
moving slowly, has his members always in perfect balance upon the
centre of gravity; because we do not find that Nature always follows
that rule, but, on the contrary, the figure will sometimes bend
sideways, standing upon one foot; sometimes it will rest part of its
weight upon that leg which is bent at the knee, as is seen in the
figures B C. But I shall reply thus, that what is not performed by the
shoulders in the figure C, is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in
another place.LXXXV./--_Of the Position of Figures_, Plate XIII./In/ the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,
lessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its
position the opposite side increases.And this is the reason: the
figure resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the
centre of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the
junction of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the
upper extremity of the perpendicular line (which passes through the
middle surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this
line bends with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at
right angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot
rests, as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve
their natural height.LXXXVI./--_Of the Joints._


/In/ the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the
difference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on
one side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in
the neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are
simple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other
two.The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the
shoulder, either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers
the head.The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without
rising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of
the shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to
the bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards
one of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face
turned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._


/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the
principal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and
forwards.Sandra went to the bathroom.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if
the arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the
motions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being
divisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,
produced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the
circumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be
said to be infinite._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXXVIII./--_Of the Motions of a Man._


/When/ you mean to represent a man removing a weight, consider that the
motions are various, viz.either a simple motion, by bending himself
to raise the weight from the ground upwards, or when he drags the
weight after him, or pushes it before him, or pulls it down with a rope
passing through a pulley.It is to be observed, that the weight of the
man's body pulls the more in proportion as the centre of his gravity
is removed from the centre of his support.To this must be added the
strength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,
to return to their natural straight situation.A man never ascends or descends, nor walks at all in any direction,
without raising the heel of the back foot.LXXXIX./--_Of the Disposition of Members preparing to act with
great Force_, Plate XIV./When/ a man prepares himself to strike a violent blow, he bends and
twists his body as far as he can to the side contrary to that which
he means to strike, and collecting all his strength, he, by a complex
motion, returns and falls upon the point he has in view[21].XC./--_Of throwing any Thing with Violence_, Plate XV./A man/ throwing a dart, a stone, or any thing else with violence,
may be represented, chiefly, two different ways; that is, he may be
preparing to do it, or the act may be already performed.If you mean to
place him in the act of preparation, the inside of the foot upon which
he rests will be under the perpendicular line of the pit of the neck;
and if it be the right foot, the left shoulder will be perpendicular
over the toes of the same foot.XCI./--_On the Motion of driving any Thing into or drawing it
out of the Ground._


/He/ who wishes to pitch a pole into the ground, or draw one out of it,
will raise the leg and bend the knee opposite to the arm which acts,
in order to balance himself upon the foot that rests, without which he
could neither drive in, nor pull out any thing.XCII./--_Of forcible Motions_, Plate XVI./Of/ the two arms, that will be most powerful in its effort, which,
having been farthest removed from its natural situation, is assisted
more strongly by the other parts to bring it to the place where it
means to go.As the man A, who moves the arm with a club E, and brings
it to the opposite side B, assisted by the motion of the whole body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.XCIII./--_The Action of Jumping._


/Nature/ will of itself, and without any reasoning in the mind of a man
going to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden
motion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up
high, till the power of the effort subsides.This impetuous motion
is accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had
bent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the
thighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards
and forwards; so that the disposition of the body tending forwards
and upwards, makes it describe a great arch when it springs up, which
increases the leap.XCIV./--_Of the three Motions in jumping upwards._


/When/ a man jumps upwards, the motion of the head is three times
quicker than that of the heel, before the extremity of the foot quits
the ground, and twice as quick as that of the hips; because three
angles are opened and extended at the same time: the superior one is
that formed by the body at its joint with the thigh before, the second
is at the joint of the thighs and legs behind, and the third is at the
instep before[22].XCV./--_Of the easy Motions of Members._


/In/ regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary
to observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn
itself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not to
move in the same direction as the head.But you will divide that motion
among four joints, viz.the feet, the knees, the hips, and the neck.If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little bent
inward, with its foot somewhat raised outward.The left shoulder should
be lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the same
side as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder
perpendicular over the great toe of the right foot.And take it as a
general maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the
chest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn
with ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this
the other joints are in some measure subservient.If the figure be
sitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast
will turn over the joint of the hip._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to
look at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of
the heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is
not done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and
lowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.The
cause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and
which last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._


/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning
the thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at
the knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,
and no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,
because the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow
it.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the
shoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have
had his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,
and seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can
bend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the
straight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend
backwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he
were kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on
both knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees
to support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other
weight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests
his foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon
that foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the
other arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,
he springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the
other.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._


/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have
some contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains
still or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on
that side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists
of judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its
feet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one
foot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any
more than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts
above that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg
which supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._


/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,
expressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the
members must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very
slightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily
appear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight
line with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the
motion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make
the joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of
that hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit
of the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep
of the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will
have its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In proportion to the height and size of the
building, and therefore to the size of its doors, will be the thickness
of its walls, especially at the foundation, that is to say, beside the
doors; and also in proportion to the numbers of a crowd will be the
unruliness and pressure of it.Hence, partly in necessity and partly in
prudence, the splaying or chamfering of the jamb of the larger door will
be deepened, and, if possible, made at a larger angle for the large door
than for the small one; so that the large door will always be
encompassed by a visible breadth of jamb proportioned to its own
magnitude.The decorative value of this feature we shall see hereafter.X. The second kind of apertures we have to examine are those of
windows.Window apertures are mainly of two kinds; those for outlook, and those
for inlet of light, many being for both purposes, and either purpose, or
both, combined in military architecture with those of offence and
defence.But all window apertures, as compared with door apertures, have
almost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from
the slit or cross slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole
of the castle to the pillars of light of the cathedral apse.Yet,
according to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness hold
respecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows
successively, but without reference to military architecture, which
here, as before, we may dismiss as a subject of separate science, only
noticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful,
if not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus
necessarily determined, and that many of their most picturesque forms
have resulted from the requirements of war.We should also find in
military architecture the typical forms of the two classes of outlet and
inlet windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight
and range of shot on the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and
air on the other, being constantly required at the smallest possible
apertures.Our business, however, is to reason out the laws for
ourselves, not to take the examples as we find them.For these no general outline is
determinable by the necessities or inconveniences of outlooking, except
only that the bottom or sill of the windows, at whatever height, should
be horizontal, for the convenience of leaning on it, or standing on it
if the window be to the ground.The form of the upper part of the window
is quite immaterial, for all windows allow a greater range of sight
when they are _approached_ than that of the eye itself: it is the
approachability of the window, that is to say, the annihilation of the
thickness of the wall, which is the real point to be attended to.If,
therefore, the aperture be inaccessible, or so small that the thickness
of the wall cannot be entered, the wall is to be bevelled[57] on the
outside, so as to increase the range of sight as far as possible; if the
aperture can be entered, then bevelled from the point to which entrance is
possible.The bevelling will, if possible, be in every direction, that is
to say, upwards at the top, outwards at the sides, and downwards at the
bottom, but essentially _downwards_; the earth and the doings upon it
being the chief object in outlook windows, except of observatories; and
where the object is a distinct and special view downwards, it will be of
advantage to shelter the eye as far as possible from the rays of light
coming from above, and the head of the window may be left horizontal, or
even the whole aperture sloped outwards, as the slit in a letter-box
is inwards.The best windows for outlook are, of course, oriels and bow windows, but
these are not to be considered under the head of apertures merely; they
are either balconies roofed and glazed, and to be considered under the
head of external appliances, or they are each a story of an external
semi-tower, having true aperture windows on each side of it.These windows may, of course, be of any shape
and size whatever, according to the other necessities of the building, and
the quantity and direction of light desired, their purpose being now to
throw it in streams on particular lines or spots; now to diffuse it
everywhere; sometimes to introduce it in broad masses, tempered in
strength, as in the cathedral  window; sometimes in starry
showers of scattered brilliancy, like the apertures in the roof of an
Arabian bath; perhaps the most beautiful of all forms being the rose,
which has in it the unity of both characters, and sympathy with that of
the source of light itself.It is noticeable, however, that while both
the circle and pointed oval are beautiful window forms, it would be very
painful to cut either of them in half and connect them by vertical
lines, as in Fig.The reason is, I believe, that so treated, the
upper arch is not considered as connected with the lower, and forming an
entire figure, but as the ordinary arch roof of the aperture, and the
lower arch as an arch _floor_, equally unnecessary and unnatural.Also
