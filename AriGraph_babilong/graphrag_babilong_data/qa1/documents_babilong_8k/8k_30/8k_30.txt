‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.Sandra went to the office.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.Daniel went to the bedroom.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due
 as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your
 loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

_To Mrs.Simson_

      ‘ARCHANGEL, _Nov.Have not been very well; nothing to worry about.Shall report in London, then come straight to you.‘INGLIS.’




CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.John travelled to the garden.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.John went back to the bedroom.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at
