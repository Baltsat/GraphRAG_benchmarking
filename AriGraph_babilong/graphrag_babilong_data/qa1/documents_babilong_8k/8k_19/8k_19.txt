_Reg._             Conscript Fathers!hear me.----
 Though this exchange teems with a thousand ills,
 Yet 'tis th' example I would deprecate.This treaty fix'd, Rome's honour is no more.Should her degenerate sons be promis'd life,
 Dishonest life, and worthless liberty,
 Her glory, valour, military pride,
 Her fame, her fortitude, her all were lost.What honest captive of them all would wish
 With shame to enter her imperial gates,
 The flagrant scourge of slavery on his back?None, none, my friends, would wish a fate so vile,
 But those base cowards who resign'd their arms
 Unstain'd with hostile blood, and poorly sued,
 Through ignominious fear of death, for bondage;
 The scorn, the laughter, of th' insulting foe._Man._ However hurtful this _exchange_ may be,
 The liberty, the life of Regulus,
 More than compensates for it._Reg._                   Thou art mistaken.----
 This Regulus is a mere mortal man,
 Yielding apace to all th' infirmities
 Of weak, decaying nature.----I am old,
 Nor can my future, feeble services
 Assist my country much; but mark me well:
 The young fierce heroes you'd restore to Carthage,
 In lieu of this old man, are her chief bulwarks.in vig'rous youth this well-strung arm
 Fought for my country, fought and conquer'd for her:
 That was the time to prize its service high.Now, weak and nerveless, let the foe possess it,
 For it can harm them in the field no more.Let Carthage have the poor degrading triumph
 To close these failing eyes;--but, O my countrymen!Check their vain hopes, and show aspiring Afric
 That heroes are the common growth of Rome._Man._ Unequall'd fortitude._Pub._                    O fatal virtue!_Man._ (_to the Senators._)
 Let honour be the spring of all our actions,
 Not interest, Fathers.Let no selfish views
 Preach safety at the price of truth and justice._Reg._ If Rome would thank me, I will teach her how.--Know, Fathers, that these savage Africans
 Thought me so base, so very low of soul,
 That the poor wretched privilege of breathing,
 Would force me to betray my country to them.Have these barbarians any tortures left
 To match the cruelty of such a thought?Arm, arm yourselves, prepare your citizens,
 Snatch your imprison'd eagles from their fanes,
 Fly to the shores of Carthage, force her gates,
 Dye every Roman sword in Punic blood--
 And do such deeds--that when I shall return,
 (As I have _sworn_, and am resolv'd to do,)
 I may behold with joy, reflected back,
 The terrors of your rage in the dire visages
 Of my astonish'd executioners._Ham._ Surprise has chill'd my blood!_Man._ Romans, we must defer th' important question;
 Maturest councils must determine on it.Rest we awhile:----Nature requires some pause
 From high-rais'd admiration.Thou, Hamilcar,
 Shalt shortly know our final resolution.Meantime, we go to supplicate the gods._Man._ Yes, Regulus, I think the danger less
 To lose th' advantage thy advice suggests,
 Than would accrue to Rome in losing thee,
 Whose wisdom might direct, whose valour guard her.Athirst for glory, thou wouldst rush on death,
 And for thy country's sake wouldst greatly perish.Too vast a sacrifice thy zeal requires,
 For Rome must bleed when Regulus expires.[_Exeunt Consul and Senators._

 _Manent_ REGULUS, PUBLIUS, HAMILCAR; _to them
 enter_ ATTILIA _and_ LICINIUS._Ham._ Does Regulus fulfil his promise thus?_Reg._ I've promis'd to return, and I will do it._Lic._                              Ah!and At._ O by this hand we beg----

 _Reg._                             Away!Thanks to Rome's guardian gods I'm yet a slave!And will be still a slave to make Rome free!_At._ Was the exchange refus'd?conduct Hamilcar and myself
 To that abode thou hast for each provided.And will my father spurn his household gods?_Pub._ My sire a stranger?----Will he taste no more
 The smiling blessings of his cheerful home?_Reg._ Dost thou not know the laws of Rome forbid
 A foe's ambassador within her gates?_Pub._ This rigid law does not extend to thee._Reg._ Yes; did it not alike extend to all,
 'Twere tyranny.--The law rights every man,
 But favours none._At._                Then, O my father,
 Allow thy daughter to partake thy fate!The present exigence
 Demands far other thoughts, than the soft cares,
 The fond effusions, the delightful weakness,
 The dear affections 'twixt the child and parent._At._ How is my father chang'd, from what I've known him!_Reg._ The fate of Regulus is chang'd, not Regulus.I am the same; in laurels or in chains
 'Tis the same principle; the same fix'd soul,
 Unmov'd itself, though circumstances change.The native vigour of the free-born mind
 Still struggles with, still conquers adverse fortune;
 Soars above chains, invincible though vanquish'd.[_Exeunt_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS.ATTILIA, HAMILCAR _going; enter_ BARCE._Ham._                     Ah!my long-lost Barce:
 Again I lose thee; Regulus rejects
 Th' exchange of prisoners Africa proposes.My heart's too full.--Oh, I have much to say!_Barce._ Yet you unkindly leave me, and say nothing.didst thou love as thy Hamilcar loves,
 Words were superfluous; in my eyes, my Barce,
 Thou'dst read the tender eloquence of love,
 Th' uncounterfeited language of my heart.A single look betrays the soul's soft feelings,
 And shows imperfect speech of little worth._At._ My father then conspires his own destruction,
 Is it not so?_Barce._       Indeed I fear it much;
 But as the senate has not yet resolv'd,
 There is some room for hope: lose not a moment;
 And, ere the Conscript Fathers are assembled,
 Try all the powers of winning eloquence,
 Each gentle art of feminine persuasion,
 The love of kindred, and the faith of friends,
 To bend the rigid Romans to thy purpose._At._ Yes, Barce, I will go; I will exert
 My little pow'r, though hopeless of success.fall'n from hope's gay heights
 Down the dread precipice of deep despair.So some tir'd mariner the coast espies,
 And his lov'd home explores with straining eyes;
 Prepares with joy to quit the treacherous deep,
 Hush'd every wave, and every wind asleep;
 But ere he lands upon the well-known shore,
 Wild storms arise, and furious billows roar,
 Tear the fond wretch from all his hopes away,
 And drive his shatter'd bark again to sea.SCENE--_A Portico of a Palace without the gates of
 Rome--The abode of the Carthaginian Ambassador_._Enter_ REGULUS _and_ PUBLIUS _meeting_.Publius here at such a time as this?Know'st thou th' important question that the Senate
 This very hour debate?--Thy country's glory,
 Thy father's honour, and the public good?Dost thou know this and fondly linger here?_Pub._ They're not yet met, my father._Reg._                            Haste--away--
 Support my counsel in th' assembled Senate,
 Confirm their wav'ring virtue by thy courage,
 And Regulus shall glory in his boy.spare thy son the most ungrateful task.What!--supplicate the ruin of my father?_Reg._ The good of Rome can never hurt her sons._Pub._ In pity to thy children, spare thyself.Daniel travelled to the bathroom._Reg._ Dost thou then think that mine's a frantic bravery?That Regulus would rashly seek his fate?how little dost thou know thy sire!learn, that like _other_ men,
 I shun the _evil_, and I seek the _good_;
 But _that_ I find in _guilt_, and _this_ in _virtue_.Were it not guilt, guilt of the blackest die,
 Even to _think_ of freedom at th' expense
 Of my dear bleeding country?To me, therefore,
 Freedom and life would be the heaviest evils;
 But to preserve that country, to restore her,
 To heal her wounds though at the price of _life_,
 Or what is dearer far, the price of liberty,
 Is _virtue_--therefore slavery and death
 Are Regulus's good--his wish--his choice._Pub._ Yet sure our country----

 _Reg._                        Is a _whole_, my Publius,
 Of which we all are _parts_; nor should a citizen
 Regard his interests as distinct from hers;
 No hopes or fears should touch his patriot soul,
 But what affect her honour or her shame.E'en when in hostile fields he bleeds to save her,
 'Tis not _his_ blood he loses, 'tis his _country's_;
 He only pays her back a debt he owes.To her he's bound for birth and education:
 Her laws secure him from domestic feuds,
 And from the foreign foe her arms protect him.She lends him honours, dignity, and rank,
 His wrongs revenges, and his merit pays;
 And like a tender and indulgent mother,
 Loads him with comforts, and would make his state
 As blest as nature and the gods design'd it.Such gifts, my son, have their alloy of _pain_;
 And let th' unworthy wretch who will not bear
 His portion of the public burden lose
 Th' advantages it yields;--let him retire
 From the dear blessings of a social life,
 And from the sacred laws which guard those blessings;
 Renounce the civilis'd abodes of man,
 With kindred brutes one common shelter seek
 In horrid wilds, and dens, and dreary caves,
 And with their shaggy tenants share the spoil;
 Or if the savage hunters miss their prey,
 From scatter'd acorns pick a scanty meal;--
 Far from the sweet civilities of life;
 There let him live and vaunt his wretched freedom:
 While we, obedient to the laws that guard us,
 Guard _them_, and live or die as they decree._Pub._ With reverence and astonishment I hear thee!Thy words, my father, have convinc'd my reason,
 But cannot touch my heart:--nature denies
 Obedience so repugnant._Reg._ A poor excuse, unworthy of a Roman!Brutus, Virginius, Manlius--they were fathers._Pub._ 'Tis true, they were; but this heroic greatness,
 This glorious elevation of the soul,
 Has been confin'd to fathers.--Rome, till now,
 Boasts not a son of such unnatural virtue,
 Who, spurning all the powerful ties of blood,
 Has labour'd to procure his father's death._Reg._ Then be the first to give the great example--
 Go, hasten; be thyself that son, my Publius.ah!--

 _Reg._               Publius, no more; begone--
 Attend the Senate--let me know my fate;
 'Twill be more glorious if announc'd by thee._Pub._ Too much, too much thy rigid virtue claims
 From thy unhappy son.In either case an obvious duty waits thee:
 If thou regard'st me as an alien here,
 Learn to prefer to mine the good of Rome;
 If as a father--reverence my commands.couldst thou look into my inmost soul,
 And see how warm it burns with love and duty,
 Thou would'st abate the rigour of thy words._Reg._ Could I explore the secrets of thy breast,
 The virtue I would wish should flourish there
 Were fortitude, not weak, complaining love._Pub._ If thou requir'st my _blood_, I'll shed it all;
 But when thou dost enjoin the harsher task
 That I should labour to procure thy death,
 Forgive thy son--he has not so much virtue._Reg._ Th' important hour draws on, and now my soul
 Loses her wonted calmness, lest the Senate
 Should doubt what answer to return to Carthage.look down propitious on her,
 Inspire her Senate with your sacred wisdom,
 And call up all that's Roman in their souls!_Enter_ MANLIUS (_speaking_).See that the lictors wait, and guard the entrance--
 Take care that none intrude._Reg._                         Ah!_Man._                     Where, where is Regulus?The great, the godlike, the invincible?Oh, let me strain the hero to my breast.--

 _Reg._ (_avoiding him._)
 Manlius, stand off, remember I'm a slave!_Man._                    I am something more:
 I am a man enamour'd of thy virtues;
 Thy fortitude and courage have subdued me.I _was_ thy _rival_--I am _now_ thy _friend_;
 Allow me that distinction, dearer far
 Than all the honours Rome can give without it._Reg._ This is the temper still of noble minds,
 And these the blessings of an humble fortune.Had I not been a _slave_, I ne'er had gain'd
 The treasure of thy friendship._Man._                           I confess,
 Thy grandeur cast a veil before my eyes,
 Which thy reverse of fortune has remov'd.Oft have I seen thee on the day of triumph,
 A conqueror of nations, enter Rome;
 Now, thou hast conquer'd fortune, and thyself.Thy laurels oft have mov'd my soul to envy,
 Thy chains awaken my respect, my reverence;
 Then Regulus appear'd a hero to me,
 He rises now a god._Reg._                    Manlius, enough.Cease thy applause; 'tis dang'rous; praise like thine
 Might tempt the most severe and cautious virtue.Bless'd be the gods, who gild my latter days
 With the bright glory of the Consul's friendship!_Man._ Forbid it, Jove!said'st thou thy _latter_ days?May gracious heav'n to a far distant hour
 Protract thy valued life!Be it _my_ care
 To crown the hopes of thy admiring country,
 By giving back her long-lost hero to her.I will exert my power to bring about
 Th' exchange of captives Africa proposes._Reg._ Manlius, and is it thus, is this the way
 Thou dost begin to give me proofs of friendship?if thy love be so destructive to me,
 What would thy hatred be?John went back to the kitchen.Shall I then lose the profit of my wrongs?Be thus defrauded of the benefit
 I vainly hop'd from all my years of bondage?I did not come to show my chains to Rome,
 To move my country to a weak compassion;
 I came to save her _honour_, to preserve her
 From tarnishing her glory; came to snatch her
 From offers so destructive to her fame.either give me proofs more worthy
 A Roman's friendship, or renew thy hate.John went back to the hallway._Man._ Dost thou not know, that this exchange refus'd,
 Inevitable death must be thy fate?_Reg._ And has the name of _death_ such terror in it,
 To strike with dread the mighty soul of Manlius?'Tis not _to-day_ I learn that I am mortal.The foe can only take from Regulus
 What wearied nature would have shortly yielded;
 It will be now a voluntary gift,
 'Twould then become a tribute seiz'd, not offer'd.Yes, Manlius, tell the world that as I liv'd
 For Rome alone, when I could live no longer,
 'Twas my last care how, dying, to assist,
 To save that country I had liv'd to serve.Hast thou then sworn, thou awfully good man,
 Never to bless the Consul with thy friendship?_Reg._ If thou wilt love me, love me like a _Roman_.These are the terms on which I take thy friendship.We both must make a sacrifice to Rome,
 I of my life, and thou of _Regulus_:
 One must resign his being, one his friend.It is but just, that what procures our country
 Such real blessings, such substantial good,
 Should cost thee something--I shall lose but little.but promise, ere thou goest,
 With all the Consular authority,
 Thou wilt support my counsel in the Senate.If thou art willing to accept these terms,
 With transport I embrace thy proffer'd friendship._Man._ (_after a pause._) Yes, I do promise._Reg._                 Bounteous gods, I thank you!Ye never gave, in all your round of blessing,
 A gift so greatly welcome to my soul,
 As Manlius' friendship on the terms of honour!_Reg._ My friend, there's not a moment to be lost;
 Ere this, perhaps, the Senate is assembled.To thee, and to thy virtues, I commit
 The dignity of Rome--my peace and honour._Reg._                       Farewell, my friend!_Man._ The sacred flame thou hast kindled in my soul
 Glows in each vein, trembles in every nerve,
 And raises me to something more than man.My blood is fir'd with virtue, and with Rome,
 And every pulse beats an alarm to glory.Who would not spurn a sceptre when compar'd
 With chains like thine?Thou man of every virtus,
 O, farewell!Daniel travelled to the kitchen._Reg._ Now I begin to live; propitious heaven
 Inclines to favour me.----Licinius here?_Lic._ With joy, my honour'd friend, I seek thy presence._Lic._                   Because my heart once more
 Beats high with flattering hope.In thy great cause
 I have been labouring._Reg._                 Say'st thou in _my_ cause?_Lic._ In thine and Rome's.Couldst thou, then, think so poorly of Licinius,
 That base ingratitude could find a place
 Within his bosom?--Can I, then, forget
 Thy thousand acts of friendship to my youth?Forget them, too, at that important moment
 When most I might assist thee?--Regulus,
 Thou wast my leader, general, father--all.Didst thou not teach me early how to tread
 The path of glory; point the way thyself,
 And bid me follow thee?_Reg._                    But say, Licinius,
 What hast thou done to serve me?_Lic._                             I have defended
 Thy liberty and life!_Reg._                 Ah!speak--explain.--

 _Lic._ Just as the Fathers were about to meet,
 I hasten'd to the temple--at the entrance
 Their passage I retarded by the force
 Of strong entreaty: then address'd myself
 So well to each, that I from each obtain'd
 A declaration, that his utmost power
 Should be exerted for thy life and freedom._Lic._ Not he alone; no, 'twere indeed unjust
 To rob the fair Attilia of her claim
 To filial merit.--What I could, I did.But _she_--thy charming daughter--heav'n and earth,
 What did she not to save her father?_Reg._                                  Who?_Lic._ Attilia, thy belov'd--thy age's darling!Was ever father bless'd with such a child?how her looks took captive all who saw her!How did her soothing eloquence subdue
 The stoutest hearts of Rome!How did she rouse
 Contending passions in the breasts of all!With what a soft, inimitable grace
 She prais'd, reproach'd, entreated, flatter'd, sooth'd._Lic._                        What could they say?See where she comes--Hope dances in her eyes,
 And lights up all her beauties into smiles._At._ Once more, my dearest father----

 _Reg._                         Ah, presume not
 To call me by that name.For know, Attilia,
 I number _thee_ among the foes of Regulus._Reg._ His worst of foes--the murd'rer of his glory.is it then a proof of enmity
 To wish thee all the good the gods can give thee,
 To yield my life, if needful, for thy service?_Reg._ Thou rash, imprudent girl!thou little know'st
 The dignity and weight of public cares.Who made a weak and inexperienc'd _woman_
 The arbiter of Regulus's fate?_Lic._ For pity's sake, my Lord!_Reg._                      Peace, peace, young man!_That_ bears at least the semblance of repentance.Immortal Powers!----a daughter and a Roman!_At._ Because I _am_ a daughter, I presum'd----

 _Lic._ Because I _am_ a Roman, I aspired
 T' oppose th' inhuman rigour of thy fate._Reg._ No more, Licinius.How can he be call'd
 A Roman who would live in infamy?Or how can she be Regulus's daughter
 Whose coward mind wants fortitude and honour?Mary travelled to the garden.now you make me _feel_
 The burden of my chains: your feeble souls
 Have made me know I am indeed a slave._At._ Tell me, Licinius, and, oh!tell me truly,
 If thou believ'st, in all the round of time,
 There ever breath'd a maid so truly wretched?To weep, to mourn a father's cruel fate--
 To love him with soul-rending tenderness--
 To know no peace by day or rest by night--
 To bear a bleeding heart in this poor bosom,
 Which aches, and trembles but to think he suffers:
 This is my crime--in any other child
 'Twould be a merit._Lic._                Oh!my best Attilia,
 Do not repent thee of the pious deed:
 It was a virtuous error._That_ in _us_
 Is a just duty, which the god-like soul
 Of Regulus would think a shameful weakness.If the contempt of life in him be virtue,
 It were in us a crime to let him perish.Perhaps at last he may consent to live:
 He then will thank us for our cares to save him:
 Let not his anger fright thee.Though our love
 Offend him now, yet, when his mighty soul
 Is reconcil'd to life, he will not chide us.The sick man loathes, and with reluctance takes
 The remedy by which his health's restor'd._Lic._ Would my Attilia rather lose her father
 Than, by offending him, preserve his life?If he but live, I am contented._Lic._ Yes, he shall live, and we again be bless'd;
 Then dry thy tears, and let those lovely orbs
 Beam with their wonted lustre on Licinius,
 Who lives but in the sunshine of thy smiles.O Fortune, Fortune, thou capricious goddess!Thy frowns and favours have alike no bounds:
 Unjust, or prodigal in each extreme.When thou wouldst humble human vanity,
 By singling out a wretch to bear thy wrath,
 Thou crushest him with anguish to excess:
 If thou wouldst bless, thou mak'st the happiness
 Too poignant for his giddy sense to bear.----
 Immortal gods, who rule the fates of men,
 Preserve my father!bless him, bless him, heav'n!If your avenging thunderbolts _must_ fall,
 Strike _here_--this bosom will invite the blow,
 And _thank_ you for it: but in mercy spare,
 Oh!spare _his_ sacred, venerable head:
 Respect in _him_ an image of yourselves;
 And leave a world, who wants it, an example
 Of courage, wisdom, constancy and truth.Mary went to the office.Yet if, Eternal Powers who rule this ball!You have decreed that Regulus must fall;
 Teach me to yield to your divine command,
 And meekly bow to your correcting hand;
 Contented to resign, or pleas'd receive,
 What wisdom may withhold, or mercy give.SCENE--_A Gallery in the Ambassador's Palace._


 _Reg._ (_alone._)
 Be calm, my soul!Thou hast defied the dangers of the deep,
 Th' impetuous hurricane, the thunder's roar,
 And all the terrors of the various war;
 Yet, now thou tremblest, now thou stand'st dismay'd,
 With fearful expectation of thy fate.----
 Yes--thou hast amplest reason for thy fears;
 For till this hour, so pregnant with events,
 Thy fame and glory never were at stake.Soft--let me think--what is this thing call'd _glory_?'Tis the soul's tyrant, that should be dethron'd,
 And learn subjection like her other passions!'tis false: this is the coward's plea;
 The lazy language of refining vice.That man was born in vain, whose wish to serve
 Is circumscrib'd within the wretched bounds
 Of _self_--a narrow, miserable sphere!Glory exalts, enlarges, dignifies,
 Absorbs the selfish in the social claims,
 And renders man a blessing to mankind.--
 It is this principle, this spark of deity,
 Rescues debas'd humanity from guilt,
 And elevates it by her strong excitements:--
 It takes off sensibility from pain,
 From peril fear, plucks out the sting from death,
 Changes ferocious into gentle manners,
 And teaches men to imitate the gods.he advances with a down-cast eye,
 And step irresolute----

    _Enter_ PUBLIUS._Reg._                My Publius, welcome!quickly tell me.--

 _Pub._ I cannot speak, and yet, alas!_Reg._ Tell me the whole.--

 _Pub._                Would I were rather dumb!_Reg._ Publius, no more delay:--I charge thee speak._Pub._ The Senate has decreed thou shalt depart.thou hast at last prevail'd--
 I thank the gods, I have not liv'd in vain!Where is Hamilcar?--find him--let us go,
 For Regulus has nought to do in Rome;
 I have accomplished her important work,
 And must depart._Pub._            Ah, my unhappy father!_Reg._ Unhappy, Publius!Does he, does that bless'd man deserve this name,
 Who to his latest breath can serve his country?_Pub._ Like thee, my father, I adore my country,
 Yet weep with anguish o'er thy cruel chains._Reg._ Dost thou not know that _life_'s a slavery?The body is the chain that binds the soul;
 A yoke that every mortal must endure.Wouldst thou lament--lament the general fate,
 The chain that nature gives, entail'd on all,
 Not these _I_ wear?_Pub._              Forgive, forgive my sorrows:
 I know, alas!too well, those fell barbarians
 Intend thee instant death._Reg._                   So shall my life
 And servitude together have an end.----
 Publius, farewell; nay, do not follow me.--

 _Pub._ Alas!my father, if thou ever lov'dst me,
 Refuse me not the mournful consolation
 To pay the last sad offices of duty
 I e'er can show thee.----

 _Reg._                  No!--thou canst fulfil
 Thy duty to thy father in a way
 More grateful to him: I must strait embark.Be it meanwhile thy pious care to keep
 My lov'd Attilia from a sight, I fear,
 Would rend her gentle heart.--Her tears, my son,
 Would dim the glories of thy father's triumph.And should her sorrows pass the bounds of reason,
 Publius, have pity on her tender age,
 Compassionate the weakness of her sex;
 We must not hope to find in _her_ soft soul
 The strong exertion of a manly courage.----
 Support her fainting spirit, and instruct her,
 By thy example, how a Roman ought
 To bear misfortune.And be to her the father she will lose.I leave my daughter to thee--I do more----
 I leave to thee the conduct of--thyself.I perceive thy courage fails--
 I see the quivering lip, the starting tear:--
 That lip, that tear calls down my mounting soul.Resume thyself--Oh, do not blast my hope!Yes--I'm compos'd--thou wilt not mock my age--
 Thou _art_--thou art a _Roman_--and my son._Pub._ And is he gone?--now be thyself, my soul--
 Hard is the conflict, but the triumph glorious.Yes.--I must conquer these too tender feelings;
 The blood that fills these veins demands it of me;
 My father's great example too requires it.Forgive me _Rome_, and _glory_, if I yielded
 To nature's strong attack:--I must subdue it.Now, Regulus, I _feel_ I am thy _son_._Enter_ ATTILIA _and_ BARCE._At._ My brother, I'm distracted, wild with fear--
 Tell me, O tell me, what I dread to know--
 Is it then true?--I cannot speak--my father?_Barce._ May we believe the fatal news?_Pub._                                Yes, Barce,
 It is determin'd._At._ Immortal Powers!--What say'st thou?_Barce._                               Can it be?_At._                  Then you've all betray'd me._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ LICINIUS._Barce._                         Pity us, Hamilcar!_At._ Oh, help, Licinius, help the lost Attilia!_Lic._                     Ah!my fair mourner,
 All's lost._At._          What all, Licinius?Tell me, at least, where Regulus is gone:
 The daughter shall partake the father's chains,
 And share the woes she knew not to prevent.[_Going._

 _Pub._ What would thy wild despair?Attilia, stay,
 Thou must not follow; this excess of grief
 Would much offend him._At._                    Dost thou hope to stop me?_Pub._ I hope thou wilt resume thy better self,
 And recollect thy father will not
