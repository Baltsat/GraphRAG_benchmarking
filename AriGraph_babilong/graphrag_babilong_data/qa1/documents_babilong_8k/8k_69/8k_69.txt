It was generally
agreed that they had no rivals; yet there were others who had as skilful
cooks, others who, for such a purpose, were equally profuse in their
expenditure.What, then, was the secret spell of his success?John moved to the bathroom.The
simplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it.His Lordship's
plates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses,
and at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their
preparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably
lessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance
that every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate.The reason
of a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so
celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really,
it is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior
that it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner.The common white
pottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the
cafes, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour.Now, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been
so often on the point of completion, the fabrics of our unrivalled
potteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found
throughout France.The dinners of both nations would be improved: the
English would gain a delightful beverage, and the French, for the first
time in their lives, would dine off hot plates.An unanswerable instance
of the advantages of commercial reciprocity.The guests at Lord Monmouth's to-day were chiefly Carlists, individuals
bearing illustrious names, that animate the page of history, and are
indissolubly bound up with the glorious annals of their great country.They are the phantoms of a past, but real Aristocracy; an Aristocracy
that was founded on an intelligible principle; which claimed great
privileges for great purposes; whose hereditary duties were such, that
their possessors were perpetually in the eye of the nation, and
who maintained, and, in a certain point of view justified, their
pre-eminence by constant illustration.It pleased Lord Monmouth to show great courtesies to a fallen race with
whom he sympathised; whose fathers had been his friends in the days of
his hot youth; whose mothers he had made love to; whose palaces had been
his home; whose brilliant fetes he remembered; whose fanciful splendour
excited his early imagination; and whose magnificent and wanton luxury
had developed his own predisposition for boundless enjoyment.Soubise
and his suppers; his cutlets and his mistresses; the profuse and
embarrassed De Lauragais, who sighed for 'entire ruin,' as for a strange
luxury, which perpetually eluded his grasp; these were the heroes of the
olden time that Lord Monmouth worshipped; the wisdom of our ancestors
which he appreciated; and he turned to their recollection for relief
from the vulgar prudence of the degenerate days on which he had fallen:
days when nobles must be richer than other men, or they cease to have
any distinction.It was impossible not to be struck by the effective appearance of Lady
Monmouth as she received her guests in grand toilet preparatory to the
ball; white satin and minever, a brilliant tiara.Her fine form, her
costume of a fashion as perfect as its materials were sumptuous, and her
presence always commanding and distinguished, produced a general effect
to which few could be insensible.It was the triumph of mien over mere
beauty of countenance.The hotel of Madame S. de R----d is not more distinguished by its
profuse decoration, than by the fine taste which has guided the vast
expenditure.Its halls of arabesque are almost without a rival; there is
not the slightest embellishment in which the hand and feeling of art are
not recognised.The rooms were very crowded; everybody distinguished in
Paris was there: the lady of the Court, the duchess of the Faubourg, the
wife of the financier, the constitutional Throne, the old Monarchy, the
modern Bourse, were alike represented.Marshals of the Empire, Ministers
of the Crown, Dukes and Marquesses, whose ancestors lounged in the
Oeil de Boeuf; diplomatists of all countries, eminent foreigners of all
nations, deputies who led sections, members of learned and scientific
academies, occasionally a stray poet; a sea of sparkling tiaras,
brilliant bouquets, glittering stars, and glowing ribbons, many
beautiful faces, many famous ones: unquestionably the general air of a
firstrate Parisian saloon, on a great occasion, is not easily equalled.In London there is not the variety of guests; nor the same size and
splendour of saloons.Coningsby, who had stolen away from his grandfather's before the rest of
the guests, was delighted with the novelty of the splendid scene.He had
been in Paris long enough to make some acquaintances, and mostly with
celebrated personages.In his long fruitless endeavour to enter the
saloon in which they danced, he found himself hustled against the
illustrious Baron von H----t, whom he had sat next to at dinner a few
days before at Count M----e's.'It is more difficult than cutting through the Isthmus of Panama,
Baron,' said Coningsby, alluding to a past conversation.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.'Infinitely,' replied M. de H., smiling; 'for I would undertake to
cut through the Isthmus, and I cannot engage that I shall enter this
ball-room.'Time, however, brought Coningsby into that brilliant chamber.What a
blaze of light and loveliness!To sounds of stirring melody, beautiful beings move
with grace.Grace, indeed, is beauty in action.Sandra travelled to the kitchen.Here, where all are fair and everything is attractive, his eye is
suddenly arrested by one object, a form of surpassing grace among the
graceful, among the beauteous a countenance of unrivalled beauty.She was young among the youthful; a face of sunshine amid all that
artificial light; her head placed upon her finely-moulded shoulders with
a queen-like grace; a coronet of white roses on her dark brown hair; her
only ornament.It was the beauty of the picture-gallery.The eye of Coningsby never quitted her.When the dance ceased, he had an
opportunity of seeing her nearer.He met her walking with her cavalier,
and he was conscious that she observed him.Finally he remarked that she
resumed a seat next to the lady whom he had mistaken for her mother, but
had afterwards understood to be Lady Wallinger.Coningsby returned to the other saloons: he witnessed the entrance and
reception of Lady Monmouth, who moved on towards the ball-room.Soon
after this, Sidonia arrived; he came in with the still handsome and ever
courteous Duke D----s. Observing Coningsby, he stopped to present him to
the Duke.Daniel went to the kitchen.While thus conversing, the Duke, who is fond of the English,
observed, 'See, here is your beautiful countrywoman that all the world
are talking of.He brings to me letters from one of
your lords, whose name I cannot recollect.'And Sir Joseph and his lovely niece veritably approached.The Duke
addressed them: asked them in the name of his Duchess to a concert on
the next Thursday; and, after a thousand compliments, moved on.Sidonia
stopped; Coningsby could not refrain from lingering, but stood a little
apart, and was about to move away, when there was a whisper, of which,
without hearing a word, he could not resist the impression that he was
the subject.He felt a little embarrassed, and was retiring, when he
heard Sidonia reply to an inquiry of the lady, 'The same,' and then,
turning to Coningsby, said aloud, 'Coningsby, Miss Millbank says that
you have forgotten her.'Coningsby started, advanced,  a little, could not conceal
his surprise.The lady, too, though more prepared, was not without
confusion, and for an instant looked down.Coningsby recalled at that
moment the long dark eyelashes, and the beautiful, bashful countenance
that had so charmed him at Millbank; but two years had otherwise
effected a wonderful change in the sister of his school-day friend,
and transformed the silent, embarrassed girl into a woman of surpassing
beauty and of the most graceful and impressive mien.Coningsby should not recollect my niece,'
said Sir Joseph, addressing Sidonia, and wishing to cover their mutual
embarrassment; 'but it is impossible for her, or for anyone connected
with her, not to be anxious at all times to express to him our sense of
what we all owe him.'Coningsby and Miss Millbank were now in full routine conversation,
consisting of questions; how long she had been at Paris; when she had
heard last from Millbank; how her father was; also, how was her brother.Sidonia made an observation to Sir Joseph on a passer-by, and then
himself moved on; Coningsby accompanying his new friends, in a contrary
direction, to the refreshment-room, to which they were proceeding.'And you have passed a winter at Rome,' said Coningsby.I feel that I shall never be able to travel.''Life has become so stirring, that there is ever some great cause that
keeps one at home.''Life, on the contrary, so swift, that all may see now that of which
they once could only read.''The golden and silver sides of the shield,' said Coningsby, with a
smile.'And you, like a good knight, will maintain your own.''Oh, yes; I think there are no such faithful correspondents as we are; I
only wish we could meet.''You will soon; but he is such a devotee of Oxford; quite a monk; and
you, too, Mr.'Yes, and at the same time as Millbank.I was in hopes, when I once paid
you a visit, I might have found your brother.''But that was such a rapid visit,' said Miss Millbank.'I always remember it with delight,' said Coningsby.'You were willing to be pleased; but Millbank, notwithstanding Rome,
commands my affections, and in spite of this surrounding splendour, I
could have wished to have passed my Christmas in Lancashire.'Millbank has lately purchased a very beautiful place in the county.I became acquainted with Hellingsley when staying at my grandfather's.'I have never seen it; indeed, I was much surprised that papa became
its purchaser, because he never will live there; and Oswald, I am sure,
could never be tempted to quit Millbank.You know what enthusiastic
ideas he has of his order?''Like all his ideas, sound, and high, and pure.I always duly
appreciated your brother's great abilities, and, what is far more
important, his lofty mind.When I recollect our Eton days, I cannot
understand how more than two years have passed away without our being
together.I might now have been at Oxford
instead of Paris.And yet,' added Coningsby, 'that would have been a sad
mistake, since I should not have had the happiness of being here.'Oh, yes, that would have been a sad mistake,' said Miss Millbank.'Edith,' said Sir Joseph, rejoining his niece, from whom he had been
momentarily separated, 'Edith, that is Monsieur Thiers.'Daniel moved to the garden.In the meantime Sidonia reached the ball-room, and sitting near the
entrance was Lady Monmouth, who immediately addressed him.He was, as
usual, intelligent and unimpassioned, and yet not without a delicate
deference which is flattering to women, especially if not altogether
unworthy of it.Sidonia always admired Lucretia, and preferred her
society to that of most persons.But the Lady was in error in supposing
that she had conquered or could vanquish his heart.Sidonia was one of
those men, not so rare as may be supposed, who shrink, above all things,
from an adventure of gallantry with a woman in a position.He had
neither time nor temper for sentimental circumvolutions.He detested the
diplomacy of passion: protocols, protracted negotiations, conferences,
correspondence, treaties projected, ratified, violated.He had no genius
for the tactics of intrigue; your reconnoiterings, and marchings, and
countermarchings, sappings, and minings, assaults, sometimes surrenders,
and sometimes repulses.All the solemn and studied hypocrisies were to
him infinitely wearisome; and if the movements were not merely formal,
they irritated him, distracted his feelings, disturbed the tenor of his
mind, deranged his nervous system.Something of the old Oriental vein
influenced him in his carriage towards women.He was oftener behind the
scenes of the Opera-house than in his box; he delighted, too, in the
society of _etairai_; Aspasia was his heroine.Mary went to the bathroom.Obliged to appear much in
what is esteemed pure society, he cultivated the acquaintance of clever
women, because they interested him; but in such saloons his feminine
acquaintances were merely psychological.John went back to the hallway.No lady could accuse him of
trifling with her feelings, however decided might be his predilection
for her conversation.He yielded at once to an admirer; never trespassed
by any chance into the domain of sentiment; never broke, by any accident
or blunder, into the irregular paces of flirtation; was a man who
notoriously would never diminish by marriage the purity of his race;
and one who always maintained that passion and polished life were quite
incompatible.He liked the drawing-room, and he liked the Desert, but he
would not consent that either should trench on their mutual privileges.The Princess Lucretia had yielded herself to the spell of Sidonia's
society at Coningsby Castle, when she knew that marriage was impossible.But she loved him; and with an Italian spirit.Now they met again,
and she was the Marchioness of Monmouth, a very great lady, very much
admired, and followed, and courted, and very powerful.It is our great
moralist who tells us, in the immortal page, that an affair of gallantry
with a great lady is more delightful than with ladies of a lower degree.In this he contradicts the good old ballad; but certain it is that
Dr.Johnson announced to Boswell, 'Sir, in the case of a Countess the
imagination is more excited.'But Sidonia was a man on whom the conventional superiorities of life
produced as little effect as a flake falling on the glaciers of the high
Alps.His comprehension of the world and human nature was too vast
and complete; he understood too well the relative value of things to
appreciate anything but essential excellence; and that not too much.A
charming woman was not more charming to him because she chanced to be
an empress in a particular district of one of the smallest planets; a
charming woman under any circumstances was not an unique animal.When
Sidonia felt a disposition to be spellbound, he used to review in his
memory all the charming women of whom he had read in the books of all
literatures, and whom he had known himself in every court and clime,
and the result of his reflections ever was, that the charming woman in
question was by no means the paragon, which some who had read, seen,
and thought less, might be inclined to esteem her.There was, indeed,
no subject on which Sidonia discoursed so felicitously as on woman, and
none on which Lord Eskdale more frequently endeavoured to attract him.He would tell you Talmudical stories about our mother Eve and the Queen
of Sheba, which would have astonished you.There was not a free lady of
Greece, Leontium and Phryne, Lais, Danae, and Lamia, the Egyptian girl
Thonis, respecting whom he could not tell you as many diverting tales as
if they were ladies of Loretto; not a nook of Athenseus, not an obscure
scholiast, not a passage in a Greek orator, that could throw light on
these personages, which was not at his command.What stories he would
tell you about Marc Antony and the actress Cytheris in their chariot
drawn by tigers!What a character would he paint of that Flora who gave
her gardens to the Roman people!No
man was ever so learned in the female manners of the last centuries of
polytheism as Sidonia.You would have supposed that he had devoted his
studies peculiarly to that period if you had not chanced to draw him
to the Italian middle ages.And even these startling revelations were
almost eclipsed by his anecdotes of the Court of Henry III.of France,
with every character of which he was as familiar as with the brilliant
groups that at this moment filled the saloons of Madame de R----d.




CHAPTER III.The image of Edith Millbank was the last thought of Coningsby, as he
sank into an agitated slumber.To him had hitherto in general been
accorded the precious boon of dreamless sleep.Homer tells us these
phantasms come from Jove; they are rather the children of a distracted
soul.Coningsby this night lived much in past years, varied by
painful perplexities of the present, which he could neither subdue
nor comprehend.The scene flitted from Eton to the castle of his
grandfather; and then he found himself among the pictures of the Rue de
Tronchet, but their owner bore the features of the senior Millbank.A
beautiful countenance that was alternately the face in the mysterious
picture, and then that of Edith, haunted him under all circumstances.He
woke little refreshed; restless, and yet sensible of some secret joy.He woke to think of her of whom he had dreamed.The light had dawned on
his soul.what is that ambition that haunts our youth, that thirst for power
or that lust of fame that forces us from obscurity into the sunblaze of
the world, what are these sentiments so high, so vehement, so ennobling?They vanish, and in an instant, before the glance of a woman!Coningsby had scarcely quitted her side the preceding eve.He hung
upon the accents of that clear sweet voice, and sought, with tremulous
fascination, the gleaming splendour of those soft dark eyes.And now
he sat in his chamber, with his eyes fixed on vacancy.All thoughts and
feelings, pursuits, desires, life, merge in one absorbing sentiment.It is impossible to exist without seeing her again, and instantly.He
had requested and gained permission to call on Lady Wallinger; he would
not lose a moment in availing himself of it.As early as was tolerably
decorous, and before, in all probability, they could quit their hotel,
Coningsby repaired to the Rue de Rivoli to pay his respects to his new
friends.As he walked along, he indulged in fanciful speculations which connected
Edith and the mysterious portrait of his mother.He felt himself, as
it were, near the fulfilment of some fate, and on the threshold of some
critical discovery.[Illustration]

                        The snow that night was at its best,
                        And held its shape however pressed;
                        Like dough beneath the baker's hand
                        It seemed to answer each demand.The rolls, when tumbled to and fro,
                        Increased with every turning, so
    First like a cushion on they sped,
    Then like a pillow, next, a bed,
    Until the snow, adhering there,
    Would leave the grass or pebbles bare.As higher blocks of snow were laid
    Still higher scaffolding was made,
    And ladders brought to use instead
    Of those too short to reach the head.[Illustration]

    Thus grew the form from hour to hour;
    For Brownies' hands have wondrous power,
    And let them turn to what they will
    Surprising work will follow still.Some shaped the legs or smoothed the waist,
    Some saw plump arms were rightly placed;
    The head was fixed with proper pose,
    Well fashioned were both ears and nose.So close thronged Brownies high and low,
    A looker-on would hardly know
      What plan or shape the busy band
        Of cunning Brownies had in hand.But plan they had, and deftness too,
            As well was seen when they were through.The rounded form and manly port
                Showed modeling of rarest sort,
                While charcoal eyes, so well designed
                They seemed to read the very mind,
                Long icicles for beard and hair,
                Were last affixed with taste and care.And when the poles around the base
                Had been returned each to its place,
                And every ladder, bench, and board
                They had in use, again was stored,
                The Brownies stood around awhile
                To gaze upon their work and smile.Each points at head, or hand, or toe,
          His special handiwork to show.In truth, they had good reason there
          With joy and pride to stand and stare,
          And contemplate the object white
          Which loomed above to such a height,
                And not unlike some hero old,
                For courage famed, or action bold,
                With finger pointed out, as though,
                To indicate the coming foe.But morning light soon came to chase
                  The Brownies to their hiding-place.And children on their way to school
                  Forgot their lessons and the rule
    While gazing on the statue tall
    That seemed to guard the County Hall.And after drifts had left the square,
    When roads and shingle-roofs were bare,
    The Brownies' statue, like a tower,
    Still bravely faced both wind and shower--
    Though sinking slowly all the while,
    And losing corpulence and style,
    Till gardeners, on the first of May,
    With shovels pitched the man away.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES IN THE ACADEMY.[Illustration]

                The Brownies once with capers spry
                  To an Academy drew nigh,
                  Which, founded by a generous hand,
                  Spread light and learning through the land.The students, by ambition fired,
                And men of science had retired;
              So Brownies, through their mystic power,
            Now took advantage of the hour.A battery was soon displayed,
        And strange experiments were made;
      Electric currents were applied
    To meadow-frogs they found inside,
    Which sage professors, nights and days,
    Had gathered up, in various ways.To making pills some turned the mind,
    While some to Dentistry inclined,
    And aching teeth, both small and large,
    Were there extracted free of charge.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More gazed where phrenologic charts
    Showed heads partitioned off in parts.Said one: "Let others knowledge gain
    Through which to conquer ache and pain,
    But by these charts I'll do my best
    To learn where Fancy makes her nest."Another cried, as he surveyed
    The bumps that were so well arrayed:
    "These heads exhibit, full and clear,
    Which one to love and whom to fear;
      Who is with noble thoughts inspired,
        And who with hate or envy fired;
          The man as timid as the hare,
            The man destructive as the bear.While choosing partners, one may find
                It well to keep these charts in mind."[Illustration]

    A microscope at length, they found;
    And next, the Brownies gathered round
    A stereopticon machine
    That cast its rays upon a screen.A thousand times it magnified,
    Till, stretching out on every side,
    An object large and larger spread,
    And filled the gazing group with dread.The locust, beetle, and the bee
    Soon gained proportions strange to see,
    And seemed like monsters close at hand
    To put an end to all the band.[Illustration]

    Ere long a door was open swung,
    To show some skeletons that hung
    From hook and peg, which caused a shout
    Of fear to rise from those about.Said one: "Thus Science works its way
    Through old remains from day to day;
    And those who during life could find
    No time, perhaps, to aid mankind,
    May, after all, in some such place
                       For years assist the human race
                       By giving students, as you see,
                       Some knowledge of Anatomy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                      At other times, all breathless grouped
                      O'er crucibles, the Brownies stooped
    To separate, with greatest skill,
    The grains which cure from those that kill;
    While burning acids, blazes blue,
    And odors strong confused the crew.Cried one: "Through trials hard to bear,
    The student must himself prepare,
    Though mixing paint, or mixing pill--
        Or mixing phrases, if you will--
        No careless study satisfies
             If one would to distinction rise;
                  The minds that shed from pole to pole
                  The light of years, as round we roll,
                  Are first enriched through patient toil,
                  And kindled by the midnight oil."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Thus, spicing logic with a joke,
          They chatted on till morning broke;
    And then with wild and rapid race
    The Brownie band forsook the place.THE BROWNIES IN THE ORCHARD.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          The autumn nights began to fill
            The mind with thoughts of winter chill,
            When Brownies in an orchard met,
            Where ripened fruit was hanging yet.Mary went back to the garden.Said one, "The apples here, indeed,
            Must now be mellow to the seed;
    And, ere another night, should be
    Removed at once from every tree.For any evening now may call
    The frost to nip and ruin all."Another quickly answer made:
    "This man is scarcely worthy aid;
    'Tis said his harsh and cruel sway
                   Has turned his children's love away."It matters not who owns the place,
                   Or why neglect thus shows its face,"
                   A third replied; "the fact is clear
                   That fruit should hang no longer here.If worthy people here reside
                   Then will our hands be well applied;
                   And if unworthy folks we serve,
                   Still better notice we'll deserve."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            "You speak our minds so full and fair,"
          One loudly cried, "that speech we'll spare.But like the buttons on your back,
      We'll follow closely in your track,
    And do our part with willing hand,
    Without one doubting _if_ or _and_."Kind deeds the Brownies often do
      Unknown to me as well as you;
        The wounded hare, by hunters maimed,
          Is sheltered and supplied and tamed.The straying cat they sometimes find
                   Half-starved, and chased by dogs unkind,
                   And bring it home from many fears
                   To those who mourned its loss with tears.And to the bird so young and bare,
                                     With wings unfit to fan the air,
                                     That preying owls had thought to rend
                                     The Brownie often proves a friend.[Illustration]

                     Then bags and baskets were brought out
                     From barns and buildings round about,
                     With kettles, pans, and wooden-ware
