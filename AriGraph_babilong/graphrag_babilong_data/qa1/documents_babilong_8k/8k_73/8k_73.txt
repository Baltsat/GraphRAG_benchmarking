"Well, what do you think about it?""If you are asking me to give you permission to waylay and assault every
man who dares to look at me--"

"I guess this is all a joke to you."She leaned over and put a tender hand on his arm."I don't want to hurt you; but, Joe, I don't want to be engaged yet.There's such a lot to do in the
world first.There's such a lot to see and be."Do you want
more time to pull bastings for your mother?Or to slave for your Aunt
Harriet?Or to run up and down stairs, carrying towels to roomers?Marry
me and let me take care of you."Once again her dangerous sense of humor threatened her.He looked
so boyish, sitting there with the moonlight on his bright hair, so
inadequate to carry out his magnificent offer.Two or three of the
star blossoms from the tree had fallen all his head."Let me take care of myself for a while.I'm not unhappy; but I want to do something.And some day I shall,--not anything big; I know.I can't do that,--but
something useful.Then, after years and years, if you still want me,
I'll come back to you."All the joy had gone out of the summer
night for him, poor lad.He glanced down the Street, where Palmer Howe
had gone home happily with Sidney's friend Christine.Palmer would
always know how he stood with Christine.She would never talk about
doing things, or being things.Either she would marry Palmer or she
would not.A fellow did not even caress
her easily.When he had only kissed her arm--He trembled a little at the
memory."I shall always want you," he said.It had not occurred to either of them that this coming back, so
tragically considered, was dependent on an entirely problematical going
away.Nothing, that early summer night, seemed more unlikely than that
Sidney would ever be free to live her own life.The Street, stretching
away to the north and to the south in two lines of houses that seemed
to meet in the distance, hemmed her in.She had been born in the little
brick house, and, as she was of it, so it was of her.Her hands had
smoothed and painted the pine floors; her hands had put up the twine on
which the morning-glories in the yard covered the fences; had, indeed,
with what agonies of slacking lime and adding blueing, whitewashed the
fence itself!"She's capable," Aunt Harriet had grumblingly admitted, watching from
her sewing-machine Sidney's strong young arms at this humble spring
task.her mother had said, as she bent over her hand work.She was not strong enough to run the sewing-machine.So Joe Drummond stood on the pavement and saw his dream of taking Sidney
in his arms fade into an indefinite futurity."I'm not going to give you up," he said doggedly."When you come back,
I'll be waiting."The shock being over, and things only postponed, he dramatized his grief
a trifle, thrust his hands savagely into his pockets, and scowled down
the Street.In the line of his vision, his quick eye caught a tiny
moving shadow, lost it, found it again.Sidney was running by that time; they were gaining.Their quarry, a
four-inch chipmunk, hesitated, gave a protesting squeak, and was caught
in Sidney's hand."You miserable little beast--with cats
everywhere, and not a nut for miles!""That reminds me,"--Joe put a hand into his pocket,--"I brought some
chestnuts for him, and forgot them.Reginald's escape had rather knocked the tragedy out of the evening.True, Sidney would not marry him for years, but she had practically
promised to sometime.John travelled to the kitchen.And when one is twenty-one, and it is a summer
night, and life stretches eternities ahead, what are a few years more or
less?Sidney was holding the tiny squirrel in warm, protecting hands.I say, Sidney, it's more than half an engagement.Won't you
kiss me good-night?"Kisses were rare in the staid
little household to which she belonged.I'm not very happy, and it will be something to remember."Perhaps, after all, Sidney's first kiss would have gone without her
heart,--which was a thing she had determined would never happen,--gone
out of sheer pity.But a tall figure loomed out of the shadows and
approached with quick strides.Poor Joe, with the summer evening quite spoiled, with no caress to
remember, and with a potential rival who possessed both the years and
the inches he lacked, coming up the Street!When he reached the doorstep, Sidney
was demurely seated and quite alone.The roomer, who had walked
fast, stopped and took off his hat.He carried
a suitcase, which was as it should be.The men of the Street always
carried their own luggage, except the younger Wilson across the way.His
tastes were known to be luxurious.Sidney inquired, after a formal greeting.She indicated
the place on the step just vacated by Joe."You'd better cool off out
here.I think I should have warned you of
that before you took the room.These little houses with low roofs are
fearfully hot."The steps were very low, and he was tall.Besides, he did not care to establish any relations with the people
in the house.Long evenings in which to read, quiet nights in which to
sleep and forget--these were the things he had come for.But Sidney had moved over and was smiling up at him.He folded up
awkwardly on the low step.Sidney
had a panicky thought of the little room upstairs.I--I suppose I don't think about it," said the
roomer, rather surprised at himself.Reginald, having finished his chestnut, squeaked for another."Just Reginald--my ground-squirrel."Sidney was skinning a nut with her
strong white teeth."That's another thing I should have told you.I'm
afraid you'll be sorry you took the room.""I'm beginning to think that YOU are sorry."She was all anxiety to reassure him:--

"It's because of Reginald.He's
really not troublesome; but he's building a nest under the bureau,
and if you don't know about him, it's rather unsettling to see a paper
pattern from the sewing-room, or a piece of cloth, moving across the
floor."Le Moyne thought it might be very interesting."Although, if there's
nest-building going on, isn't it--er--possible that Reginald is a lady
ground-squirrel?"Sidney was rather distressed, and, seeing this, he hastened to add that,
for all he knew, all ground-squirrels built nests, regardless of sex.As a matter of fact, it developed that he knew nothing whatever of
ground-squirrels.She chatted gayly of the tiny
creature--of his rescue in the woods from a crowd of little boys, of his
restoration to health and spirits, and of her expectation, when he was
quite strong, of taking him to the woods and freeing him.Le Moyne, listening attentively, began to be interested.His quick mind
had grasped the fact that it was the girl's bedroom he had taken.Other
things he had gathered that afternoon from the humming sewing-machine,
from Sidney's businesslike way of renting the little room, from the
glimpse of a woman in a sunny window, bent over a needle.Genteel
poverty was what it meant, and more--the constant drain of disheartened,
middle-aged women on the youth and courage of the girl beside him.K. Le Moyne, who was living his own tragedy those days, what with
poverty and other things, sat on the doorstep while Sidney talked, and
swore a quiet oath to be no further weight on the girl's buoyant spirit.And, since determining on a virtue is halfway to gaining it, his voice
lost its perfunctory note.He had no intention of letting the Street
encroach on him.He had built up a wall between himself and the rest of
the world, and he would not scale it.Let others get what they could out of living.Sidney, suddenly practical, broke in on his thoughts:--

"Where are you going to get your meals?"I can stop in somewhere on my way downtown.I work in the gas office--I don't believe I told you.It's rather
haphazard--not the gas office, but the eating."It's very bad for you," said Sidney, with decision."It leads to
slovenly habits, such as going without when you're in a hurry, and that
sort of thing.The only thing is to have some one expecting you at a
certain time."McKee's boarding-house at the corner.Twenty-one
meals for five dollars, and a ticket to punch.Tillie, the dining-room
girl, punches for every meal you get.If you miss any meals, your ticket
is good until it is punched.McKee doesn't like it if you
miss."McKee for me," said Le Moyne."I daresay, if I know
that--er--Tillie is waiting with the punch, I'll be fairly regular to my
meals."The Street, which mistrusted night air, even on a
hot summer evening, was closing its windows.Reginald, having eaten
his fill, had cuddled in the warm hollow of Sidney's lap, and slept.By shifting his position, the man was able to see the girl's face.Very
lovely it was, he thought.From
the middle age of his almost thirty years, she was a child.There had
been a boy in the shadows when he came up the Street.Of course there
would be a boy--a nice, clear-eyed chap--

Sidney was looking at the moon.With that dreamer's part of her that she
had inherited from her dead and gone father, she was quietly worshiping
the night.But her busy brain was working, too,--the practical brain
that she had got from her mother's side.K. Le Moyne, who had built a wall between himself and the world, had
already married her to the youth of the shadows, and was feeling an odd
sense of loss."I suppose you've been sending things to the laundry, and--what do you
do about your stockings?""Buy cheap ones and throw 'em away when they're worn out."There seemed
to be no reserve with this surprising young person.When they're closed one can button over them as well
as--"

"I think," said Sidney, "that it is quite time some one took a little
care of you.If you will give Katie, our maid, twenty-five cents a week,
she'll do your washing and not tear your things to ribbons.Sheer stupefaction was K. Le Moyne's.After a moment:--

"You're really rather wonderful, Miss Page.Here am I, lodged, fed,
washed, ironed, and mended for seven dollars and seventy-five cents a
week!""I hope," said Sidney severely, "that you'll put what you save in the
bank."He was still somewhat dazed when he went up the narrow staircase to
his swept and garnished room.Never, in all of a life that had been
active,--until recently,--had he been so conscious of friendliness and
kindly interest.Some of the tired lines left his
face.Under the gas chandelier, he straightened and threw out his arms.Then he reached down into his coat pocket and drew out a wide-awake and
suspicious Reginald.It was quite cheerful, although the little
room was hot, and although, when he stood, he had a perilous feeling
that the ceiling was close above.He deposited Reginald carefully on
the floor in front of the bureau, and the squirrel, after eyeing him,
retreated to its nest.It was late when K. Le Moyne retired to bed.Wrapped in a paper and
securely tied for the morning's disposal, was considerable masculine
underclothing, ragged and buttonless.Not for worlds would he have had
Sidney discover his threadbare inner condition."New underwear for yours
tomorrow, K. Le Moyne," he said to himself, as he unknotted his cravat."New underwear, and something besides K. for a first name."He pondered over that for a time, taking off his shoes slowly and
thinking hard."Kenneth, King, Kerr--" None of them appealed to him.And, after all, what did it matter?He dropped a shoe, and Reginald, who had gained enough courage to emerge
and sit upright on the fender, fell over backward.Sidney did not sleep much that night.She lay awake, gazing into the
scented darkness, her arms under her head.Love had come into her life
at last.A man--only Joe, of course, but it was not the boy himself, but
what he stood for, that thrilled her had asked her to be his wife.In her little back room, with the sweetness of the tree blossoms
stealing through the open window, Sidney faced the great mystery of life
and love, and flung out warm young arms.Joe would be thinking of her
now, as she thought of him.Or would he have gone to sleep, secure in
her half promise?There was coming to Sidney a time when love
would mean, not receiving, but giving--the divine fire instead of the
pale flame of youth.A night breeze came through the windows and spread coolness through
the little house.The ailanthus tree waved in the moonlight and sent
sprawling shadows over the wall of K. Le Moyne's bedroom.In the yard
the leaves of the morning-glory vines quivered as if under the touch of
a friendly hand.K. Le Moyne slept diagonally in his bed, being very long.In sleep the
lines were smoothed out of his face.He looked like a tired, overgrown
boy.And while he slept the ground-squirrel ravaged the pockets of his
shabby coat.CHAPTER II


Sidney could not remember when her Aunt Harriet had not sat at the
table.It was one of her earliest disillusionments to learn that Aunt
Harriet lived with them, not because she wished to, but because Sidney's
father had borrowed her small patrimony and she was "boarding it out."Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Eighteen years she had "boarded it out."Sidney had been born and grown
to girlhood; the dreamer father had gone to his grave, with valuable
patents lost for lack of money to renew them--gone with his faith in
himself destroyed, but with his faith in the world undiminished: for he
left his wife and daughter without a dollar of life insurance.Harriet Kennedy had voiced her own view of the matter, the after the
funeral, to one of the neighbors:--

"He left no insurance.To the little widow, her sister, she had been no less bitter, and more
explicit."It looks to me, Anna," she said, "as if by borrowing everything I had
George had bought me, body and soul, for the rest of my natural life.I'll stay now until Sidney is able to take hold.Then I'm going to live
my own life.It will be a little late, but the Kennedys live a long
time."The day of Harriet's leaving had seemed far away to Anna Page.Sidney
was still her baby, a pretty, rather leggy girl, in her first year
at the High School, prone to saunter home with three or four
knickerbockered boys in her train, reading "The Duchess" stealthily, and
begging for longer dresses.She had given up her dolls, but she still
made clothes for them out of scraps from Harriet's sewing-room.In the
parlance of the Street, Harriet "sewed"--and sewed well.She had taken Anna into business with her, but the burden of the
partnership had always been on Harriet.To give her credit, she had not
complained.She was past forty by that time, and her youth had slipped
by in that back room with its dingy wallpaper covered with paper
patterns.On the day after the arrival of the roomer, Harriet Kennedy came down to
breakfast a little late.Katie, the general housework girl, had tied
a small white apron over her generous gingham one, and was serving
breakfast.From the kitchen came the dump of an iron, and cheerful
singing.Page, who had taken advantage
of Harriet's tardiness to read the obituary column in the morning paper,
dropped it.It was her custom to jerk her chair out
and drop into it, as if she grudged every hour spent on food.Sidney,
not hearing the jerk, paused with her iron in air.She's all dressed up, and she doesn't want any coffee."It was to her that Harriet made her speech:--

"Sidney, when your father died, I promised to look after both you and
your mother until you were able to take care of yourself.Of course, even before that I had helped to support you.""If you would only have your coffee, Harriet!"Page sat with her hand on the handle of the old silver-plated
coffee-pot.You have health and energy, and you have
youth, which I haven't.In the next twenty years, at the
outside, I've got not only to support myself, but to save something to
keep me after that, if I live.I don't
want to live forever, but I've always played in hard luck."Well, Aunt Harriet, you're quite right.You've been a saint to
us, but if you want to go away--"

"Harriet!"Page, "you're not thinking--"

"Please, mother."Harriet's eyes softened as she looked at the girl

"We can manage," said Sidney quietly."We'll miss you, but it's time we
learned to depend on ourselves."After that, in a torrent, came Harriet's declaration of independence.And, mixed in with its pathetic jumble of recriminations, hostility to
her sister's dead husband, and resentment for her lost years, came
poor Harriet's hopes and ambitions, the tragic plea of a woman who must
substitute for the optimism and energy of youth the grim determination
of middle age."I can do good work," she finished."I'm full of ideas, if I could get a
chance to work them out.There isn't a woman
on the Street who knows real clothes when she sees them.They don't even
know how to wear their corsets.They send me bundles of hideous stuff,
with needles and shields and imitation silk for lining, and when I
turn out something worth while out of the mess they think the dress is
queer!"Page could not get back of Harriet's revolt to its cause.To her,
Harriet was not an artist pleading for her art; she was a sister and a
bread-winner deserting her trust."I'm sure," she said stiffly, "we paid you back every cent we borrowed.If you stayed here after George died, it was because you offered to."She fumbled for the handkerchief at her belt.But
Sidney went around the table and flung a young arm over her aunt's
shoulders."Why didn't you say all that a year ago?We've been selfish, but we're
not as bad as you think.Daniel went back to the hallway.And if any one in this world is entitled to
success you are.She covered her emotion with
details:--

"Mrs.Lorenz is going to let me make Christine some things, and if
they're all right I may make her trousseau.""She's not engaged, but her mother says it's only a matter of a short
time.I'm going to take two rooms in the business part of town, and put
a couch in the backroom to sleep on."Sidney's mind flew to Christine and her bright future, to a trousseau
bought with the Lorenz money, to Christine settled down, a married
woman, with Palmer Howe.Harriet had two
triangular red spots in her sallow cheeks."I can get a few good models--that's the only way to start.And if you
care to do hand work for me, Anna, I'll send it to you, and pay you the
regular rates.There isn't the call for it there used to be, but just a
touch gives dash."Page's grievances had worked their way to the surface.Sidney
and Harriet had made her world, such as it was, and her world was in
revolt.With you leaving, and Sidney renting her
room and sleeping on a folding-bed in the sewing-room, everything seems
upside down.I never thought I should live to see strange men running in
and out of this house and carrying latch-keys."This in reference to Le Moyne, whose tall figure had made a hurried exit
some time before.Nothing could have symbolized Harriet's revolt more thoroughly than her
going upstairs after a hurried breakfast, and putting on her hat and
coat.She had heard of rooms, she said, and there was nothing urgent in
the work-room.Her eyes were brighter already as she went out.Sidney,
kissing her in the hall and wishing her luck, realized suddenly what
a burden she and her mother must have been for the last few years.They would never be a burden again--never, as
long as she had strength and health!Page had worked herself into a state bordering on
hysteria.She came in at three o'clock,
and Katie gave her a cup of tea.At the news of her sister's condition,
she merely shrugged her shoulders."She'll not die, Katie," she said calmly."But see that Miss Sidney eats
something, and if she is worried tell her I said to get Dr.Very significant of Harriet's altered outlook was this casual summoning
of the Street's family doctor.She was already dealing in larger
figures.A sort of recklessness had come over her since the morning.Already she was learning that peace of mind is essential to successful
endeavor.Somewhere Harriet had read a quotation from a Persian poet;
she could not remember it, but its sense had stayed with her: "What
though we spill a few grains of corn, or drops of oil from the cruse?So Harriet, having spilled oil from her cruse in the shape of Dr.The recklessness of pure adventure was in her blood.She had taken rooms at a rental that she determinedly put out of her
mind, and she was on her way to buy furniture.No pirate, fitting out
a ship for the highways of the sea, ever experienced more guilty and
delightful excitement.Ed was out "on a case" and might not be
in until evening.Sidney sat in the darkened room and waved a fan over
her mother's rigid form.At half after five, Johnny Rosenfeld from the alley, who worked for a
florist after school, brought a box of roses to Sidney, and departed
grinning impishly.He knew Joe, had seen him in the store.Soon the
alley knew that Sidney had received a dozen Killarney roses at three
dollars and a half, and was probably engaged to Joe Drummond.Ed," said Sidney, as he followed her down the stairs, "can you
spare the time to talk to me a little while?"Perhaps the elder Wilson had a quick vision of the crowded office
waiting across the Street; but his reply was prompt:

"Any amount of time."Sidney led the way into the small parlor, where Joe's roses, refused by
the petulant invalid upstairs, bloomed alone."First of all," said Sidney, "did you mean what you said upstairs?"It said--which was perfectly true--that he had sacrificed himself to his
brother's career: that, for the sake of that brilliant young surgeon,
Dr.Ed had done without wife and children; that to send him abroad
he had saved and skimped; that he still went shabby and drove the old
buggy, while Max drove about in an automobile coupe.Sidney, not at
all of the stuff martyrs are made of, sat in the scented parlor and,
remembering all this, was ashamed of her rebellion."I'm going into a hospital," said Sidney.He liked to have all the symptoms before he made a
diagnosis or ventured an opinion.So Sidney, trying to be cheerful, and
quite unconscious of the anxiety in her voice, told her story."It's fearfully hard work, of course," he commented, when she had
finished."I don't think I like the idea," he said at last."It's splendid work
for an older woman.But it's life, child--life in the raw.As we get
along in years we lose our illusions--some of them, not all, thank God.But for you, at your age, to be brought face to face with things as
they are, and not as we want them to be--it seems such an unnecessary
sacrifice.""Don't you think," said Sidney bravely, "that you are a poor person to
talk of sacrifice?Haven't you always, all your life--"

Dr.Ed  to the roots of his straw- hair."Certainly not," he said almost irritably."Max had genius; I
had--ability.One real success is better than two
halves.Not"--he smiled down at her--"not that I minimize my usefulness.Somebody has to do the hack-work, and, if I do say it myself, I'm a
pretty good hack.""Then I shall be a hack, too.Of course, I had
thought of other things,--my father wanted me to go to college,--but I'm
strong and willing.And one thing I must make up my mind to, Dr.Ed; I
shall have to support my mother."Harriet passed the door on her way in to a belated supper.The man in
the parlor had a momentary glimpse of her slender, sagging shoulders,
her thin face, her undisguised middle age."Yes," he said, when she was out of hearing."It's hard, but I dare say
it's right enough, too.Only--I wish
it didn't have to be."Sidney, left alone, stood in the little parlor beside the roses.She
touched them tenderly, absently.Life, which the day before had called
her with the beckoning finger of dreams, now reached out grim insistent
hands.CHAPTER III


K. Le Moyne had wakened early that first morning in his new quarters.When he sat up and yawned, it was to see his worn cravat disappearing
with vigorous tugs under the bureau."You and I, Reginald," he apostrophized the bureau, "will have to come
to an understanding.What I leave on the floor you may have, but what
blows down is not to be touched."Because he was young and very strong, he wakened to a certain lightness
of spirit.The morning sun had always called him to a new day, and the
sun was shining.But he grew depressed as he prepared for the office.He told himself savagely, as he put on his shabby clothing, that, having
sought for peace and now found it, he was an ass for resenting it.The
trouble was, of course, that he came of fighting stock: soldiers and
explorers, even a gentleman adventurer or two, had been his forefather.He loathed peace with a deadly loathing.Having given up everything else, K. Le Moyne had also given up the
love of woman.He had been too busy for
women; and now he was too idle.A small part of his brain added figures
in the office of a gas company daily, for the sum of two dollars and
fifty cents per eight-hour working day.But the real K. Le Moyne
that had dreamed dreams, had nothing to do with the figures, but sat
somewhere in his head and mocked him as he worked at his task."Time's going by, and here you are!"mocked the real person--who was, of
course, not K. Le Moyne at all."You're the hell of a lot of use, aren't
you?Two and two are four and three are seven--take off the discount.It's a man's work, isn't it?""Somebody's got to do this sort of thing," protested the small part of
his brain that earned the two-fifty per working day."And it's a great
anaesthetic.He can't think when he's doing it.There's something
practical about figures, and--rational."He dressed quickly, ascertaining that he had enough money to buy a
five-dollar ticket at Mrs.McKee's; and, having given up the love of
woman with other things, he was careful not to look about for Sidney on
his way.McKee's, and was initiated into the mystery of
the ticket punch.The food was rather good, certainly plentiful;
and even his squeamish morning appetite could find no fault with the
self-respecting tidiness of the place.Tillie proved to be neat and
austere.He fancied it would not be pleasant to be very late for one's
meals--in fact, Sidney had hinted as much.Some of the "mealers"--the
Street's name for them--ventured on various small familiarities of
speech with Tillie.K. Le Moyne himself was scrupulously polite, but
reserved.He was determined not to let the Street encroach on his
wretchedness.Because he had come to live there was no reason why it
should adopt him.When the deaf-and-dumb book
agent wrote something on a pencil pad and pushed it toward him, he
replied in kind."We are very glad to welcome you to the McKee family," was what was
written on the pad."Very happy, indeed, to be with you," wrote back Le Moyne--and realized
with a sort of shock that he meant it.The greeting and the breakfast
cheered him; also, he had evidently made some headway with Tillie.'s previous walk of life there had been no toothpicks; or, if there
were any, they were kept, along with the family scandals, in a closet.But nearly a year of buffeting about had taught him many things.He took
one, and placed it nonchalantly in his waistcoat pocket, as he had seen
the others do.Tillie, her rush hour over, wandered back into the kitchen and poured
herself a cup of coffee.McKee was reweighing the meat order."Kind of a nice fellow," Tillie said, cup to lips--"the new man."He'd be handsome if he wasn't so grouchy-looking.Wagner sent him one of his love letters.McKee drew a long breath and entered the lam stew in a book."When I think of Anna Page taking a roomer, it just about knocks me
over, Tillie.And where they'll put him, in that little house--he
looked thin, what I saw of him.This last
referred, not to K. Le Moyne, of course, but to the lamb stew."Thin as a fiddle-string.""Just keep an eye on him, that he gets enough."Then, rather ashamed of
her unbusinesslike methods: "A thin mealer's a poor advertisement.Do
you suppose this is the dog meat or the soup scraps?"In such manner was most of the
Street and its environs connected; in such wise did its small gossip
start at one end and pursue its course down one side and up the other."Sidney Page is engaged to Joe Drummond," announced Tillie."He sent her
a lot of pink roses yesterday."There was no malice in her flat statement, no envy.Sandra journeyed to the office.Sidney and she,
living in the world of the Street, occupied different spheres.But the
very lifelessness in her voice told how remotely such things touched
her, and thus was tragic."Mealers" came and went--small clerks, petty
tradesmen, husbands living alone in darkened houses during the summer
hegira of wives.Various and catholic was Tillie's male acquaintance,
but compounded of good fellowship only.Once, years before, romance had
paraded itself before her in the garb of a traveling nurseryman--had
walked by and not come back."And Miss Harriet's going into business for herself.She's taken rooms
downtown; she's going to be Madame Something or other."If she
raises her prices she can't make my new foulard."Tillie sat at the table, her faded blue eyes fixed on the back yard,
where her aunt, Mrs.Rosenfeld, was hanging out the week's wash of table
linen."I don't know as it's so selfish," she reflected.I guess a body's got the right to live it."McKee eyed her suspiciously, but Tillie's face showed no emotion."You don't ever hear of Schwitter, do you?""No; I guess she's still living."Schwitter, the nurseryman, had proved to have a wife in an insane
asylum.That was why Tillie's romance had only paraded itself before her
and had gone by.Tillie rose and tied a gingham apron over her white one.Only sometimes--"

"I don't know as it would have been so wrong.He ain't young, and I
ain't.He had nice manners; he'd have
been good to me."Then:

"And him a married man!""Well, I'm not going to do it," Tillie soothed her."I get to thinking
about it sometimes; that's all.He's got the same nice way about him."Aye, the new man had made her think of him, and June, and the lovers
who lounged along the Street in the moonlit avenues toward the park and
love;
