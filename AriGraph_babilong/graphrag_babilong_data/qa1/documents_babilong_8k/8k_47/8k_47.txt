Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not
far away."She may know something about Talbot's visit.DAN AS A GOOD SAMARITAN."What made your husband treat you so badly?""Rum has been sinking him lower and lower,
and it's easy to see the end.""You are taking too dark a view of your husband," said Dan, soothingly."He won't go as far as that.""I know him only too well," she said."This very evening he has been
planning a burglary."Dan started, and a sudden suspicion entered his mind."Yes; it is a store on Pearl street."Dan felt that he was on the track of a discovery.He was likely to be
repaid at last for the hours he had spent in detective service.he asked, fixing his eyes intently on the woman."I don't know his name; he is a well-dressed man."Was it a man who came to your rooms this evening?"Here Dan gave a rapid description of
Talbot.He is the book-keeper of the firm."He is to pay a thousand dollars for the job."Bill, I suppose, is your husband?"By this time they had reached a small public-house, of humble exterior,
but likely to afford his companion better accommodations than she had at
home.The woman followed him, with the child in her arms.A stout German, who
appeared to be the proprietor of the establishment, was sitting in an
arm-chair, smoking a pipe.asked the German, with a broad grin."No; she is an acquaintance of mine.Her husband has driven her out of
his house in a fit of drunkenness.asked the Dutchman, shrewdly."Fifty cents a night for the lodging."asked the landlord, upon whom the silver
half-dollar produced a visible impression."Yes," said the woman; "my poor baby is tired.""You had better stay here two nights," said Dan.John travelled to the bathroom."Don't let your husband
know where you are just yet.Here is money to pay for another night's
lodging, and enough to buy food besides.""But for you I should have
had to stay out all night.""Oh, no; some one would have taken you in.""You don't know this neighborhood; the policeman would have found me,
and taken me to the station-house.For myself I care little; but my poor
babe, who is worse than fatherless----" and she burst into tears.Brighter days may be in store," said Dan,
cheerfully."I will come and see you day after to-morrow," said Dan.Our hero must not be awarded too great credit for his generosity.Rogers would willingly defray all expenses connected with
the discovery, and that the money he had advanced to his unfortunate
companion would be repaid.Had it been otherwise, however, his generous
heart would have prompted him to relieve the woman's suffering.Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr.Mary went back to the bathroom."The master won't be up for an hour," said the servant."Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.""I don't think he'll see you.He was up late last night," she said."It's very important you make yourself," said Susan, crossly."I _am_ a person of great importance," said Dan, smiling.Rogers
will see me, you'll find."Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered."You're to walk into the parlor," she said.Daniel moved to the bathroom.Rogers came down stairs almost
directly in dressing-gown and slippers.Daniel went back to the office."The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!""By two men living in Houston street--at least, one lives there.""Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr.John travelled to the garden.Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with
it some further information he had drawn from the woman."I didn't think Talbot capable of this," said Mr."He has been
in our employ for ten years.I don't like to think of his treachery,
but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it.Now, Dan, what is your
advice?""I am afraid my advice wouldn't be worth much, Mr.Rogers," said Dan,
modestly.I am indebted to you for this important
discovery.I won't promise to follow your
advice, but I should like to hear it.""Then, sir, I will ask you a question.Do you want to prevent the
robbery, or to catch the men in the act?""I wish to catch the burglars in the act.""Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?"But how can I take measures to guard
against loss?""No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks.He will draw money if I am
not at the store."He is to tell the burglars the combination.He will
get it from the janitor.""I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong
word.""I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the
time comes.""Then," continued Dan, flushing with excitement, "we'll wait till the
burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe.While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once."Mary travelled to the hallway."Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him.One of the old time machines is said to
consist of a huge tank of water placed upon wheels, drawn by a large
number of men, and to which was attached a small hose.When the water
in the tank became exhausted it was supplied by a bucket brigade,
something on the plan in use at the present time in villages not able
to support an engine.The oldest record of a fire engine in Paris was one used in the king's
library in 1684, which, having but one cylinder, threw water to a
great height, a result obtained by the use of an air chamber.Leather
hose was introduced into Amsterdam in 1670, by two Dutchmen, and they
also invented the suction pipe at about the same period.About the
close of the seventeenth century an improved engine was patented in
England.It was a strong cistern of oak placed upon wheels, furnished
with a pump, an air chamber and a suction pipe of strong leather,
through which run a spiral piece of metal.This engine was little
improved until the early part of the last century.In the United States bucket fire departments were organized in most of
the cities in the early part of the last century, and hand engines,
used by the old volunteer firemen, did not come into general use until
about fifty years later.The New York volunteer fire department was
for a long time one of the institutions of the country.When they had
their annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock
to the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day
when a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed
on exhibition.At the New York state fairs during the early '50s the
tournaments of the volunteer fire department of the various cities
throughout the state formed one of the principal attractions.Many
a melee occurred between the different organizations because they
considered that they had not been properly recognized in the line of
march or had not been awarded a medal for throwing a stream of water
farther than other competitors.A Berlin correspondent of the Pioneer Press many years ago, said that
when an alarm of fire was sounded in the city, the members of the fire
companies would put on their uniforms and report to their various
engine houses.When a sufficient number had assembled to make a
showing the foreman would call the roll, beer would be passed down the
line, the health of the kaiser properly remembered and then they would
start out in search of the fire.As a general thing the fire would
be out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then
return to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed.To Cincinnati belongs the credit of having introduced the first paid
steam fire department in the United States, but all the other large
cities rapidly followed.*       *       *       *       *

In the fall of 1850 the town fathers of St.Paul passed an ordinance
requiring the owners of all buildings, public or private, to provide
and keep in good repair, substantial buckets, marked with paint the
word "Fire" on one side and the owner's name on the other, subject
to inspection by the fire warden and to be under his control when
occasion required.Daniel went back to the hallway.The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade, was
made by R.C.Knox raised a small sum of
money by subscription, with which he purchased several ladders, and
they were frequently brought into requisition by the little band of
men whom Mr.Knox was a man of
enormous stature, and it was said he could tire out a dozen ordinary
men at a fire.*       *       *       *       *

Two public-spirited citizens of St.Paul, John McCloud and Thompson
Ritchie, purchased in the East and brought to the city at their own
expense the first fire engine introduced in the Northwest.Although
it was a miniature affair, on numerous occasions it rendered valuable
assistance in protecting the property of our pioneer merchants.Ritchie is still living, his home being in Philadelphia.*       *       *       *       *

In November, 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No.1 was organized
under provisions of the city charter.A constitution and by-laws were
adopted and the members agreed to turn out promptly on all occasions
of fire alarms.As compensation for their services they were excused
from jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military
service, for the period of five years.The original constitution of
the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership
roll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B.Pearson and
George F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason;
members, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward
Heenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash.Stevenson,
Benjamin F. Irvine, R.I.Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A.Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the
city at the present time.McCloud was a member of the firm of
McCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on
the southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets.This was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as
Mr.McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly
be called the "Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St.The old hook and ladder company was one of the representative
institutions of the city.From the date of its organization up to the
time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most
prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members.All of the
property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856,
having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were
turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of
the city fathers.At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and
ladders, and one fire engine with hose.Washington M. Stees was
made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant.This scanty
equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions
were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of
the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns
in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water
could be readily obtained.The city fathers concluded to comply with
the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two
double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August,
1858.Our citizens
then congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class
fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would
be a thing of the past.One of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder
company in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name
of A.D.Mary moved to the garden.He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he
usually went by the name of "Johnny Martin."Now Johnny always kept
his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell
sounded he was "Johnny on the spot."After the fire was over Johnny
generally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would
make a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman
before he returned to work.He would accordingly provide himself with
an immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he
proposed to execute his sanguinary threat.Strange to relate he
never succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it
generally required two or three days to restore him to his former
equilibrium.If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he
would probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen
would not be so difficult.*       *       *       *       *

In 1857 Hope Engine Company No.1 was organized, and they petitioned
the common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use.In
the fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new
engines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their
headquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of
Franklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new
brick building on Third street, fronting on Washington.Michael Leroy
was made the first foreman and R.C.Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were
his assistants.The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge,
Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T.
Toal, J.H.Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes,
B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F.Masterson, John J.
Williams and V. Metzger.During the fall of 1858 a large number of the
most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined
the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival
of the first steamer.*       *       *       *       *

In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine.2 was
organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner
of Third and Jackson streets.Grant,
foreman; M.J.Terwilliger, assistants; members,
Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A.Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R.Storing, William T. Donaldson,
Daniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace,
John McCauley and a number of others.The Minnehahas were a prosperous
organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept
open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its
members as had nothing particular to do.John travelled to the bedroom.*       *       *       *       *

Rotary Independent Company No.1 was the third engine connected with
the St.Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and
was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the
annual parade of the department.This engine was purchased from the
government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was
used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located
on lower Third street.*       *       *       *       *

By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought
they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from
that time on the annual parade of the St.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.Paul fire department was one
of the events of the year.The first parade occurred on the 12th
of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following
organizations:

  Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No.These four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line
of march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the
old city hall.In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the
different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever
there was an alarm of fire.The uptown churches would ring their
bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches
in the central part of the city would ring their bells.There was a
regular banging and clanging of the bells."In the startled air of night,
  They would scream out their afright,
  Too much horrified to speak,
  They could only shriek, shriek,
  Out of tune."Every one turned out when the fire bells rang.Unless the fire was of
sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be
seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing
uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact
location of the fire could be determined.Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire
of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to
relieve them for a short time.As a general thing the appeal would be
readily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the
police to impress into service a force sufficient to keep the brakes
working.Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to
arrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse
whenever the police were in search of a relief force.*       *       *       *       *

Upon the breaking out of the war a large number of the firemen
enlisted in the defense of the country and the ranks of the department
were sadly decimated.It was during the early part of the war that the
mayor of St.Paul made a speech to the firemen at the close of their
annual parade in which he referred to them as being as brave if not
braver than the boys at the front.The friends of the boys in blue
took serious umbrage at this break of the mayor, and the press of the
city and throughout the state were very indignant to think that the
capital city possessed a mayor of doubtful loyalty.The excitement
soon died away and the mayor was re-elected by a large majority.*       *       *       *       *

There was not much change in the condition of the department until
the arrival of the first steamer, Aug.The new steamer was
lodged with Hope Engine company, and an engineer and fireman appointed
at a salary of $1,600 per year for the two.The boys of Hope Engine
company did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer
and took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded
and St.1 was organized, and they took charge
of the new steamer.The rapid growth of the city necessitated the
frequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and at the present time the
St.Paul fire department has 211 paid men, 15 steamers, 4 chemicals, 8
hook and ladder companies and 122 horses.*       *       *       *       *

The volunteer fire department had no better friend than the late Mrs.She was the guardian angel of the fire department.No night so cold or storm so great that Mrs.Presley was not present
and with her own hands provide coffee and sandwiches for the tired and
hungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames.She
was an honored guest at all entertainments with which the firemen
were connected, and was always toasted and feasted by the boys at the
brakes.She will ever be remembered, not only by the firemen, but by
all old settlers, as one of the many noble women in St.Paul whose
unostentatious deeds of charity have caused a ray of sunshine in many
sad homes.Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire
department, but by every resident of the city.*       *       *       *       *

Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St.Paul
in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than
the Hon.He was the very personification of
punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in
exigencies of great moment.One dreary winter night his sleeping
apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short
time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced
operations.Ames discovered the nature of the
disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with
outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a
jury in an important case, exclaimed: "Gentlemen, if you will be kind
enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be
down."The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted,
but his apartments were soon incinerated.*       *       *       *       *

HOTEL FIRES.*       *       *       *       *

LIST OF HOTELS DESTROYED BY FIRE DURING ST.Daniels house, near Seven Corners.New England hotel, Third street
  Hotel to the Wild Hunter, Jackson street.*       *       *       *       *

The first hotel fire of any importance was that of the Daniels house,
located on Eagle street near Seven Corners, which occurred in 1852.The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy.A
strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable
to save the structure.Neill, Isaac Markley,
Bartlett Presley and W.M.Stees were among the firemen who assisted in
saving the furniture.*       *       *       *       *

The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the
second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king.This hotel was
constructed by the late C.W.Borup, and it was the pride of lower
town.Rich were preparing to open it when the
fire occurred.Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was
totally destroyed.*       *       *       *       *

Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to
be the first brick building erected in St.It was three stories high, and when in process of building was
considered a visionary enterprise.The building was constructed by
Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the
times would allow.It was situated on Third street near Market, and
in the early days was considered St.In its
parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature
was held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for
several terms.*       *       *       *       *

The Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on
Robert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery
element.These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time
of their destruction.*       *       *       *       *

On the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever
occurred in St.Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third
street near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three
engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on
hand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach.Nearly all the
buildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were
two-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses
occupied by the owners of the stores.When the fire was at its height
it was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before
the flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the
firemen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had
the immense smouldering mass under control.Thirty-four buildings, the
largest number ever destroyed in St.Of the two
blocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above
Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone
structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and
the other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L.The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the
first hotels built in St.The New England
was a feature in St.Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the
first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov.Ramsey had
begun housekeeping in 1849.The Empire saloon was another historic
ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the
territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first
Pioneer, April 10, 1849.The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also
destroyed at this fire.*       *       *       *       *

In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was
entirely destroyed by fire.A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused
the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control
of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene.A few pieces of
furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular
hotel.The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the
exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city.The hotel
was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M.Winslow was one
of the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West.In some peculiar
manner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building
without any capital, but when the building was completed he not only
had the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a
financier as well as a builder.The proprietors of the Winslow were
arrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were
discharged.*       *       *       *       *

The American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was
one of the landmarks of the city for a good many years.It was built
in 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel
as their headquarters.Although it was of very peculiar architecture,
the interior fittings were of a modern character.On a stormy night in
the month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this
hotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire
was beyond their control.The weather was bitter cold, and the water
would be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose.Finding their
efforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their
attention to saving the guests.There were some very narrow escapes,
but no accidents of a very serious nature.As usual, thieves were
present and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and
wearing apparel belonging to the guests.*       *       *       *       *

In the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story
brick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets.It was
occupied by them as a banking house for a long time.The business
center having been moved further down the street, they were compelled
to seek quarters on Bridge Square.After the bank moved out of
this building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them
remodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about
$20,000.It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized.When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom
lost all they possessed.The Linden theatrical company, which was
playing at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers.At this fire
a large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street
were destroyed.When the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were
left standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city
authorities, had not been demolished.Schell, one of the best
known physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near
the hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their
lax enforcement of the law.
