Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children
down in the Palmetto State.I can't offer you a dinner, seh.We've
eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to
interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.)"But I can offer
you something choicer than you have in the No'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel
remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army.My name is
Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have
the advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and
thereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like
straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit
seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor
justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with
still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which
his new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping
chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees
felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed
across from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your
damned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,
and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he
"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>
came down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company
was stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a
matter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our
sap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious
cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore
musket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive
bullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our
officers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One
fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He's the pride of
our Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope
man.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to
your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses
in De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the
face of our own batteries and your guns.Mary went to the bedroom.That man was wounded by a trick
of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his
dinner in Vicksburg.He's pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the
Colonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain't a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you
might be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I'd
hate to see him die.The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get
care and good air and good food."He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce
grip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don't look
like the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his
former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,
where the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the
magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby
Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched
on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was
a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,
beside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which
seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture
of restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the
angles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has
slept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more
handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit
burned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he
dragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, "does he look as
bad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,
and bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was
pitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging
at his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"

"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was
passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor
from a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special
detestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the
memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia
had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now
that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was
unfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the
instrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the
sick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that
seemed to rouse him.And then, with
some vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,
"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you're too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North
to-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of
the room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He's sick--and God Almighty,
he's proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went
straight to Stephen's heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned
proud--But we ain't cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet
again--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we
may as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of
a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to
recognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this
glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of
them."Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not
change, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a
log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"

"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after
that.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran
these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their
gunners.""I'd like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he
was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He's
rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can
be sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as
long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to
send him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I'll bet he didn't
thank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods
are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They
never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like
the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how
they hate a Yankee!He's a cousin of that
fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a
pity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my
advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.""I'm glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when
Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to
do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how
he flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital
steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE

Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past
at Colonel Carvel's house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,
proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How
Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom
her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none
was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax's prattle about the
fashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I'm sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river
stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown.The girl, with her hand on the
wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,
across the Illinois prairie."I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news
travels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,
telling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of
silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness.Certainly, if
Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,
news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to
her house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has
lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee
yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old
man.""The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,"
replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She
thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying
patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence
of the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had
taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the
day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside.The
marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in
spite of all barriers.Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he
would speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light
would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia
to see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into
slumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge
from this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit
to herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen's letters to
the Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty
of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday
Virginia had read one of these to Mr.Well
that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was
not there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it
not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on
him, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit
at Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of
Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we'll make short work of the
Rebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as
she repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange
that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia
on the stairway.Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she
must have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But
Virginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her
heart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was
thankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old
Nancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have
more room and air.And Colonel Carvel's name had
never once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they
toiled against the river's current, while horror held her.Horror lest
her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by
the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was
not yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of
wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at
Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been
Colonel Carvel's!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that
was dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,
he was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia
sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning
quivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the
gravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell
on a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among
the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him.Daniel went to the bathroom."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain.""I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed
