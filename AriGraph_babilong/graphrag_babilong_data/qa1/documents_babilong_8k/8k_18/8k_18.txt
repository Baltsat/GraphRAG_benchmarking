I KNEW some one would marry her
for that fifty thousand dollars!"Mary moved to the bathroom.But she laughed then, right off, with
the rest of us, at the idea of a man worth twenty millions marrying
ANYBODY for fifty thousand dollars.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END









End of Project Gutenberg's Oh, Money!They previously exacted from him an oath to return should his
embassy prove unsuccessful; at the same time giving him to understand,
that he must expect to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this
they artfully intimated as the strongest motive for him to leave no
means unattempted to accomplish their purpose.At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the Romans expressed
the wildest transports of joy, and would have submitted to almost
any conditions to procure his enlargement; but Regulus, so far from
availing himself of his influence with the Senate to obtain any personal
advantages, employed it to induce them to reject proposals so evidently
tending to dishonour their country, declaring his fixed resolution to
return to bondage and death, rather than violate his oath.He at last extorted from them their consent; and departed amidst the
tears of his family, the importunites of his friends, the applauses of
the Senate, and the tumultuous opposition of the people; and, as a great
poet of his own nation beautifully observes, "he embarked for Carthage
as calm and unconcerned as if, on finishing the tedious law-suits of his
clients, he was retiring to Venafrian fields, or the sweet country of
Tarentum."*       *       *       *       *

==> This piece is, in many parts, a pretty close imitation of the
_Attilio Regolo_ of Metastasio, but enlarged and extended into a tragedy
of five acts.Historical truth has in general been followed, except in
some less essential instances, particularly that of placing the return
of Regulus to Rome posterior to the death of his wife.The writer
herself never considered the plot as sufficiently bustling and dramatic
for representation.Deep in the bosom of departed days,
 Where the first gems of human glory blaze;
 Where, crown'd with flowers, in wreaths immortal drest,
 The sacred shades of ancient virtue rest;
 With joy they search, who joy can feel, to find
 Some honest reason still to love mankind.There the fair foundress of the scene to-night
 Explores the paths that dignify delight;
 The regions of the mighty dead pervades;
 The Sibyl she that leads us to the shades.O may each blast of ruder breath forbear
 To waft her light leaves on the ruthless air,
 Since she, as heedless, strives not to maintain
 This tender offspring of her teeming brain!For this poor birth was no provision made,
 A flower that sprung and languish'd in the shade.On Avon's banks, forsaken and forlorn,
 This careless mother left her elder born;
 And though unlike what Avon hail'd of yore,
 Those giant sons that Shakspeare's banners bore,
 Yet may we yield this little offspring grace,
 And love the last and least of such a race.Shall the strong scenes, where senatorial Rome,
 Mourn'd o'er the rigour of her patriot's doom;
 Where melting Nature aw'd by Virtue's eye,
 Hid the big drop, and held the bursting sigh;
 Where all that majesty of soul can give,
 Truth, Honour, Pity, fair Affection live;
 Shall scenes like these, the glory of an age,
 Gleam from the press, nor triumph on the stage?and, as Romans brave,
 Like Romans boast one citizen to save.REGULUS,                        _Mr.Henderson._

 THE INFLEXIBLE CAPTIVE.ACT I.


 SCENE--_A Hall in the Consul's Palace._

 _Enter_ LICINIUS, ATTILIA, _Lictors and People_.Is this a place for Regulus's daughter?must that incomparable maid
 Associate here with Lictors and Plebeians?_At._ Yes, on this threshold patiently I wait
 The Consul's coming; I would make him blush
 To see me here his suitor.O Licinius,
 This is no time for form and cold decorum;
 Five lagging years have crept their tedious round,
 And Regulus, alas!is still a slave,
 A wretched slave, unpitied, and forgotten;
 No other tribute paid his memory,
 Than the sad tears of his unhappy child;
 If _she_ be silent, who will speak for Regulus?_Lic._ Let not her sorrows make my fair unjust.Is there in Rome a heart so dead to virtue
 That does not beat in Regulus's cause?That wearies not the gods for his return?That does not think all subjugated Afric
 A slender, unimportant acquisition,
 If, in return for this extended empire,
 The freedom of thy father be the purchase?These are the feelings of Imperial Rome;
 My own, it were superfluous to declare.For if _Licinius_ were to weigh his merit,
 That he's _thy father_ were sufficient glory.He was my leader, train'd me up to arms;
 And if I boast a spark of Roman honour,
 I owe it to _his_ precepts and _his_ virtues._At._ And yet I have not seen Licinius stir.spare me thy reproaches--what, when late
 A private citizen, could I attempt?'Twas not the lust of power, or pride of rank,
 Which made me seek the dignity of tribune;
 No, my Attilia, but I fondly hop'd
 'Twould strengthen and enforce the just request
 Which as a _private_ man I vainly urg'd;
 But now, the people's representative,
 I shall _demand_, Attilia, to be heard.let us not too hastily apply
 This dang'rous remedy; I would not rouse
 Fresh tumults 'twixt the people and the senate:
 Each views with jealousy the idol, Power,
 Which, each possessing, would alike abuse.Might _I_ advise you, try a gentler method;
 I know that every moment Rome expects
 Th' ambassador of Carthage, nay, 'tis said
 The Conscript Fathers are already met
 To give him audience in Bellona's temple.There might the Consul at my suit, Licinius,
 Propose the ransom of my captive father.think, Attilia, who that Consul is,
 Manlius, thy father's rival, and his foe:
 His ancient rival, and his foe profess'd:
 To hope in him, my fair, were fond delusion._At._ Yet though his rival, Manlius is a _Roman_:
 Nor will he think of private enmities,
 Weigh'd in the balance with the good of Rome:
 Let me at least make trial of his honour._Lic._ Be it so, my fair!but elsewhere make thy suit;
 Let not the Consul meet Attilia _here_,
 Confounded with the refuse of the people._At._ Yes, I will see him _here_, e'en _here_, Licinius.Let _Manlius_ blush, not _me_: _here_ will I speak,
 _Here_ shall he answer me._Lic._                        Behold he comes._Lic._                  O bless me with a look,
 One parting look at least._At._                     Know, my Licinius,
 That at this moment I am all the _daughter_,
 The filial feelings now possess my soul,
 And other passions find no entrance there._Lic._ O sweet, yet powerful influence of virtue,
 That charms though cruel, though unkind subdues,
 And what was love exalts to admiration!Yes, 'tis the privilege of souls like thine
 To conquer most when least they aim at conquest.vouchsafe to think upon Licinius,
 Nor fear to rob thy father of his due;
 For surely virtue and the gods approve
 Unwearied constancy and spotless love.Manlius, stay, a moment stay, and hear me._Man._ I did not think to meet thee here, Attilia;
 The place so little worthy of the guest._At._ It would, indeed, have ill become Attilia,
 While still her father was a Roman citizen;
 But for the daughter of a slave to Carthage,
 It surely is most fitting._Man._                   Say, Attilia,
 What is the purpose of thy coming hither!_At._ What is the purpose, patience, pitying heaven!Tell me, how long, to Rome's eternal shame,
 To fill with horror all the wond'ring world,
 My father still must groan in Punic chains,
 And waste the tedious hours in cruel bondage?Days follow days, and years to years succeed,
 And Rome forgets her hero, is content
 That Regulus be a forgotten slave.is it that he preferr'd
 His country's profit to his children's good?Is it th' unshaken firmness of his soul,
 Just, uncorrupt, and, boasting, let me speak it,
 Poor in the highest dignities of Rome?_Man._ But know, Attilia----

 _At._                     O have patience with me.And can ungrateful _Rome_ so soon forget?Can those who breathe the air _he_ breath'd forget
 The great, the godlike virtues of my father?There's not a part of Rome but speaks his praise.The _streets_--through them the _hero_ pass'd triumphant:
 The _Forum_--there the _Legislator_ plann'd
 The wisest, purest laws:--_the Senate House_--
 There spoke the _patriot Roman_--there his voice
 Secur'd the public safety: Manlius, yes;
 The wisdom of his councils match'd his valour.Enter the _Temples_--mount the _Capitol_--
 And tell me, Manlius, to what hand but _his_
 They owe their trophies, and their ornaments.Their foreign banners, and their boasted ensigns,
 Tarentine, Punic, and Sicilian spoils?Nay, e'en those lictors who precede thy steps,
 This Consul's purple which invests thy limbs,
 All, all were Regulus's, were my father's.And yet this hero, this exalted patriot,
 This man of virtue, this immortal Roman,
 In base requital for his services,
 Is left to linger out a life in chains,
 No honours paid him but a daughter's tears._Man._ Just are thy tears:--thy father well deserves them;
 But know thy censure is unjust, Attilia.The fate of Regulus is felt by all:
 We know and mourn the cruel woes he suffers
 From barbarous Carthage._At._                      Manlius, you mistake;
 Alas!it is not Carthage which is barbarous;
 'Tis Rome, ungrateful Rome, is the barbarian;
 Carthage but punishes a foe profess'd,
 But Rome betrays her hero and her father:
 Carthage remembers how he slew her sons,
 But Rome forgets the blood he shed for _her_:
 Carthage revenges an acknowledged foe,
 But Rome, with basest perfidy, rewards
 The glorious hand that bound her brow with laurels.Which now is the barbarian, Rome or Carthage?_At._                   A woman shall inform you.Convene the senate; let them strait propose
 A ransom, or exchange for Regulus,
 To Africa's ambassador.Do this,
 And heaven's best blessings crown your days with peace._Man._ Thou speakest like a _daughter_, I, Attilia,
 Must as a _Consul_ act; I must consult
 The good of Rome, and with her good, her glory.Would it not tarnish her unspotted fame,
 To sue to Carthage on the terms thou wishest?rather own thou'rt still my father's foe.no fault of mine concurr'd
 To his destruction.ere this the senate is assembled----
 My presence is requir'd.----Speak to the fathers,
 And try to soften _their_ austerity;
 _My_ rigour they may render vain, for know,
 I am Rome's _Consul_, not her _King_, Attilia.[_Exit_ MANLIUS _with the lictors, &c._

 _At._ (_alone._)
 This flattering hope, alas!One Consul is our foe, the other absent.my unhappy father, on what hazards,
 What strange vicissitudes, what various turns,
 Thy life, thy liberty, thy all depends!_Enter_ BARCE (_in haste_)._Barce._ Ah, my Attilia!_At._                     Whence this eager haste?_Barce._ Th' ambassador of Carthage is arriv'd._At._ And why does _that_ excite such wondrous transport?_Barce._ I bring another cause of greater still._At._ Name it, my Barce._Barce._                    _Regulus_ comes with him._Barce._                    Thy father----Regulus._At._ Thou art deceiv'd, or thou deceiv'st thy friend._Barce._ Indeed I saw him not, but every tongue
 Speaks the glad tidings._At._                     See where Publius comes.John went back to the hallway._Pub._ My sister, I'm transported!Oh, Attilia,
 He's here, our father----Regulus is come!_At._ I thank you, gods: O my full heart!Hasten, my brother, lead, O lead me to him._Pub._ It is too soon: restrain thy fond impatience.With Africa's ambassador he waits,
 Until th' assembled senate give him audience._At._ Where was he Publius when thou saw'st him first?_Pub._ You know, in quality of Roman quaestor,
 My duty 'tis to find a fit abode
 For all ambassadors of foreign states.Hearing the Carthaginian was arriv'd,
 I hasten'd to the port, when, O just gods!No foreigner, no foe, no African
 Salutes my eye, but Regulus----my father!tell me, tell me all,
 And ease my anxious breast._Pub._                         Ere I arriv'd,
 My father stood already on the shore,
 Fixing his eyes with anxious eagerness,
 As straining to descry the Capitol.I saw, and flew with transport to embrace him,
 Pronounc'd with wildest joy the name of father--
 With reverence seiz'd his venerable hand,
 And would have kiss'd it; when the awful hero,
 With that stern grandeur which made Carthage tremble,
 Drew back--stood all collected in himself,
 And said austerely, Know, thou rash young man,
 That _slaves_ in _Rome_ have not the rights of _fathers_.Then ask'd, if yet the senate was assembled,
 And where?which having heard, without indulging
 The fond effusions of his soul, or mine,
 He suddenly retir'd.I flew with speed
 To find the Consul, but as yet success
 Attends not my pursuit._Barce._ Publius, you'll find him in Bellona's temple._At._ Then Regulus returns to Rome a slave!_Pub._ Yes, but be comforted; I know he brings
 Proposals for a peace; his will's his fate._At._ Rome may, perhaps, refuse to treat of peace._Pub._ Didst thou behold the universal joy
 At his return, thou wouldst not doubt success.There's not a tongue in Rome but, wild with transport,
 Proclaims aloud that Regulus is come;
 The streets are filled with thronging multitudes,
 Pressing with eager gaze to catch a look.The happy man who can descry him first,
 Points him to his next neighbour, he to his;
 Then what a thunder of applause goes round;
 What music to the ear of filial love!not a Roman eye was seen,
 But shed pure tears of exquisite delight.Judge of my feelings by thy own, my sister.By the large measure of thy fond affection,
 Judge mine.find him out;
 My joy is incomplete till he partakes it.When doubts and fears have rent my anxious heart,
 In all my woes he kindly bore a part:
 Felt all my sorrows with a soul sincere,
 Sigh'd as I sigh'd, and number'd tear for tear:
 Now favouring heav'n my ardent vows has blest,
 He shall divide the transports of my breast._Barce._               Publius, a moment hear me.Know'st thou the name of Africa's ambassador?_Barce._           Son of Hanno?Sandra journeyed to the garden._Pub._                            Yes!Daniel journeyed to the garden.Hamilcar!--How shall I support it![_Aside._

 _Pub._ Ah, charming maid!the blood forsakes thy cheek:
 Is he the rival of thy Publius?Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.speak,
 And tell me all the rigour of my fate._Barce._ Hear me, my Lord.Sandra travelled to the hallway.Since I have been thy slave,
 Thy goodness, and the friendship of Attilia,
 Have soften'd all the horrors of my fate.Till now I have not felt the weight of bondage.Till now--ah, Publius!--think me not ungrateful,
 I would not wrong thee--I will be sincere--
 I will expose the weakness of my soul.Know then, my Lord--how shall I tell thee all?_Pub._ Stop, cruel maid, nor wound thy Publius more;
 I dread the fatal frankness of thy words:
 Spare me the pain of knowing I am scorn'd;
 And if thy heart's devoted to another,
 Yet do not tell it me; in tender pity
 Do not, my fair, dissolve the fond illusion,
 The dear delightful visions I have form'd
 Of future joy, and fond exhaustless love._Barce._ (_alone._)
 And shall I see him then, see my Hamilcar,
 Pride of my soul, and lord of all my wishes?The only man in all our burning Afric
 Who ever taught my bosom how to love!If at his name I feel these strange emotions,
 How shall I see, how meet my conqueror?Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.O let not those presume to judge of joy
 Who ne'er have felt the pangs which absence gives.Such tender transport those alone can prove,
 Who long, like me, have known disastrous love;
 The tears that fell, the sighs that once were paid,
 Like grateful incense on his altar laid;
 The lambent flame rekindle, not destroy,
 And woes remember'd heighten present joy.SCENE--_The inside of the Temple of Bellona--Seats for the
 Senators and Ambassadors--Lictors guarding the entrance._

 MANLIUS, PUBLIUS, _and Senators_._Man._ Let Regulus be sent for to our presence;
 And with him the ambassador of Carthage.Is it then true the foe would treat of peace?_Pub._ They wish, at least, our captives were exchang'd,
 And send my father to declare their wish:
 If he obtain it, well: if not, then Regulus
 Returns to meet the vengeance of the foe,
 And pay for your refusal with his blood:
 He ratified this treaty with his oath,
 And ere he quitted Carthage, heard, unmov'd,
 The dreadful preparations for his death,
 Should he return.Say, can you give up Regulus to Carthage?_Man._ Peace, Publius, peace, for see thy father comes._Enter_ HAMILCAR _and_ REGULUS.I thought these walls had been well known to Regulus?I was thinking what I was
 When last I saw them, and what now I am._Ham._ (_to the Consul._)
 Carthage by me to Rome this greeting sends,
 That wearied out at length with bloody war,
 If Rome inclines to peace she offers it._Man._ We will at leisure answer thee.Come, Regulus, resume thine ancient place._Reg._ (_pointing to the Senators._) Who then are these?_Man._                            The Senators of Rome._Man._         What meanst thou?I'm her Consul;
 Hast thou so soon forgotten Manlius?_Reg._ And shall a _slave_ then have a place in Rome
 Among her Consuls and her Senators?_Man._ Yes!--For her _heroes_ Rome forgets her _laws_;
 Softens their harsh austerity for thee,
 To whom she owes her conquests and her triumphs._Reg._ Rome may forget, but Regulus remembers._Man._ Was ever man so obstinately good?[_Aside._

 _Pub._ (_rising._) Fathers![_To the Senators._

 _Reg._ Publius, what dost thou mean?_Pub._                             To do my duty:
 Where Regulus must stand, shall Publius sit?O Rome, how are thy manners chang'd!When last I left thee, ere I sail'd for Afric,
 It was a crime to think of private duties
 When public cares requir'd attention.----Sit,
 (_To_ PUBLIUS.)_Pub._ Forgive me, sir, if I refuse obedience:
 My heart o'erflows with duty to my father._Reg._ Know, Publius, that duty's at an end;
 Thy father died when he became a slave._Man._ Now urge thy suit, Hamilcar, we attend._Ham._ Afric hath chosen Regulus her messenger.In him, both Carthage and Hamilcar speak._Man._ (_to_ REGULUS.)_Ham._ (_to_ REGULUS.)Ere thou speak'st,
 Maturely weigh what thou hast sworn to do,
 Should Rome refuse to treat with us of peace._Reg._ What I have sworn I will fulfil, Hamilcar._Pub._       Ye guardian gods of Rome,
 With your own eloquence inspire him now!_Reg._ Carthage by me this embassy has sent:
 If Rome will leave her undisturb'd possession
 Of all she now enjoys, she offers _peace_;
 But if you rather wish protracted war,
 Her next proposal is, _exchange of captives_;----
 If you demand advice of _Regulus_,
 Reject them both!_Ham._              What dost thou mean?_Pub._                                    My father!I will not idly spend my breath,
 To show the dire effects of such a peace;
 The foes who beg it, show their dread of war._Man._ But the exchange of prisoners thou proposest?_Reg._ That artful scheme conceals some Punic fraud.hast thou so soon forgotten;

 _Reg._ I will fulfil the treaty I have sworn to.
