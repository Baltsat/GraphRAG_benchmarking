As though to
decrease the difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short
galleries, in which only a part of the laying is stacked.Sandra journeyed to the garden.We must then
follow the same mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next
if we would obtain a complete census of her family.A spot of colour,
dropped on the Bee's thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in
closing up the mouth of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia
in her various homes.In this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the
first year, with an average of twelve cells.Next year, the summer
appeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,
reaching fifteen.The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not
in a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of
twenty-six.On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not
uncommon.Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that
the family of the Osmia fluctuates roundabout fifteen in number.I have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in the
cells of one and the same series.The partitions, at first widely
spaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to the
aperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in
front.The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between
one portion and another of the string.Without any exception known to
me, the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more
abundant provisions than the straitened cells with which the series
ends.The heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice
as large as that in the second.In the last cells, the most recent in
date, the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount
that we wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.One would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,
attaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space
and food so sparingly.The first-born receive the benefit of her early
enthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious
apartments.The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs
are laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of
food and a tiny corner.The difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.The large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the
small ones, those in front, have cocoons only half or a third as big.Before opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let
us wait for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take
place towards the end of summer.If impatience get the better of us, we
can open them at the end of July or in August.The insect is then in
the nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the
two sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,
and by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future
armour of the females.Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow
front cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to
males; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at
the back, all belong to females.The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia
consists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a
group of males.With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and
with old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the
Horned Osmia in fair quantities.I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build
her nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from
expecting.All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps
horizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her
usual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.Lastly,
I succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the
privacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house.With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with
the Three-horned Osmia.At the back are large cells with plentiful
provisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with
scanty provisions and partitions close together.Also, the larger cells
supplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me
little cocoons and males.The conclusion therefore is exactly the same
in the case of all three Osmiae.These conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,
to the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule
stands out from this collection of facts.Apart from the strange
exception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any
order, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce
first a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of
males, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells.This
distribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the
Hive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of workers, or
sterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of males.The analogy
continues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of
provisions.The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells
incomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a
much larger amount of food.Everything therefore demonstrates that we
are here in the presence of a general rule.OPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.Is there nothing beyond a
laying in two series?Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of
them fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct
groups, the male group following upon the female group, without any
mixing of the two?Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change
in this arrangement, should circumstances require it?The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from
being solved.In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very
irregularly, as though at random.Why this mixture in the series of
cocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the
Three-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in
the hollow of a reed?What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her
kinswomen of the reeds do too?Nothing, so far as I know, explains this
fundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.The three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in
general outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close
similarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the
cause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying.If I
open a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find
it impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively
between a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the
cylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always
the same distance apart.If I open it in July, the victualling-period,
it is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined
for the males and those destined for the females.The measurement of
the column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.We find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes
in the adult form tells us.The male does not differ materially from
the female in respect of size.If he is a trifle smaller, it is
scarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned
Osmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we
have seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons.In the Mason-bee
of the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less
pronounced.The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting
the dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex
of the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one
end of the series to the other.It does not matter if the sexes
alternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever
their position in the row.The two other Osmiae, with their great
disparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the
twofold consideration of board and lodging.The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it
appeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and
the regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were
all traceable to a common law.It seemed to me that the arrangement in
a succession first of females and then of males did not account for
everything.And I was right: that
arrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is
remarkable in a very different way.This is what I am going to prove by
experiment.The succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,
invariable.Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three
generations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be
recognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female
cells of more spacious dimensions.This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two
cells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest
fashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of
recent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,
harmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be
stocked.The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant
cells: two larger and three smaller.The total space at her disposal
would do for about a third of the laying.Well, in the two large cells,
she puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs
admit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to
lay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity.We
can go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of
succession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between
one old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and
females according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which
she happens to be occupying.Here then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she
has not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into
sections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions
imposed upon her.She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,
for, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the
nest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which
those chambers were originally built; and this happens however small
the number of chambers to be filled.When the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first
rows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.But, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite
unable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a
few vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be
already irrevocably fixed?She can only do so by abandoning the
arrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the
varied exigencies of the home.Either she finds it impossible to make
an economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or
else she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to
lay.The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the
latter point.We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,
who themselves dig out the foundation of their cells.They make use of
the old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as
hollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in
walls, clay or wood.Their work is confined to repairs to the house,
such as partitions and covers.There are plenty of these retreats; and
the insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going
any distance to look for them.But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she
returns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely
difficult to exhaust.It is here, in this little familiar corner, that
she prefers to settle her progeny.But then the apartments are few in
number and of all shapes and sizes.Daniel went to the garden.There are long and short ones,
spacious ones and narrow.Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan
course, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no
choice.Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments
which I will now describe.I have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the
Three-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I
had prepared for her.Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or
reed, predominated.There were tubes of all lengths and widths.In the
long tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females
followed by a series of males, were deposited.As I have already
referred to this result, I will not discuss it again.The short tubes
were sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the
total laying.Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the
cocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the
final lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required
for two cocoons only, of different sexes.Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as
eagerly as the long tubes.Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:
their contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with
female and ended with male cocoons.This order was invariable; what
varied was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion
between the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and
sometimes females.When confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the
Osmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old
nest.She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does.She breaks up
her laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal
demands; and each series begins with females and ends with males.This
breaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes
are represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire
laying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the
length of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of
the insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the
exigencies of space.And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add
those connected with the earlier development of the males.These burst
their cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are
the first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree.In order to
release themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing
the string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they
must occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason
that makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males.Being
next to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without
upsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests
of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with
cylindrical cavities in them.These cavities are formed, as in the old
nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called
and of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer
coating at the time of its deliverance.The diameter is about 7
millimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre
of the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.)and at
the edge averages 14 millimetres.(.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes
even the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female
occupying the lower and the male the upper storey.Lastly, the deeper
cavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower
to males.We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of
the Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the
Sheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted
similar facts.The choice rests with the mother,
who is guided by considerations of space and, according to the
accommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and
incapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in
that, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their
unequal development.This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous
and varied facts which I have set forth.People unfamiliar with insect
anatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following
explanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has
at her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably
female and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of
either group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her
choice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be
stocked.Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from
the heap of eggs.Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.Nothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy
will show.The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera
consists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,
divided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the
oviduct, which carries the eggs outside.Each of these glove-fingers is
fairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is
closed.It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads
on a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of
which the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones
halfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary.Every
stage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from
bottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the
embryo.The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any
inversion of the order is impossible.Besides, an inversion would
result in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in
an earlier stage of development.Therefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of
the eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in
the common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.Moreover, at the nesting-period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one
and each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short
time swells enormously.Some hours or even a day before the laying,
that egg by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the
ovigerous apparatus.This is the egg which is on the point of being
laid.It is about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at
its proper time; and the mother has no power to make another take its
place.It is this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will
presently be laid upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey
or a live prey; it alone is ripe, it alone lies at the entrance to the
oviduct; none of the others, since they are farther back in the row and
not at the right stage of development, can be substituted at this
crisis.What will it yield, a male or a female?No lodging has been prepared,
no food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in
keeping with the sex that will proceed from it.And here is a much more
puzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,
has to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found
for a cell.There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though
the statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian
tube, has no determined sex.It is perhaps during the few hours of its
rapid development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on
its passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's
pleasure, the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle
which it has to fill, either a female or a male.Let us admit that,
when the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m
females and n males.Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in
the mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the
m group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be
possible for her laying to be represented as m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, etc.females and by n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc.males, the sum of m + n
remaining constant, but one of the sexes being partly permuted into the
other.The ultimate conclusion even cannot be disregarded: we must
admit a set of eggs represented by m - m, or zero, females and of n + m
males, one of the sexes being completely replaced by the other.Conversely, it must be possible for the feminine series to be augmented
from the masculine series to the extent of absorbing it entirely.It
was to solve this question and some others connected with it that I
undertook, for the second time, to rear the Three-horned Osmia in my
study.The problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am also
better-equipped.My apparatus consists of two small closed
packing-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes, in
which I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal
position.I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which
suit their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive,
at any time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to
carry it to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens,
the operations of the busy worker.My investigations, however frequent
and minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in
her maternal duties.I mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the
thorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning to
the end of her laying.The tubes and their respective holes are
numbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from
day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and
particularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing
marks.As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another.Moreover, I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of
empty Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in
view.Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of
Helix caespitum.Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the
date of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the
Osmia to whom it belonged.In this way, I spent five or six weeks in
continual observation.To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost
condition is patience.This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded
with the success which I was justified in expecting.The first, which are cylindrical
and of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the
facts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.The others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very
different diameters, set end to end.The front cylinder, the one which
projects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,
varies in width between 8 and 12 millimetres.(Between.312 and.468
inch.--Translator's Note.)The second, the back one, contained entirely
within my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6
millimetres in diameter.(.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's Note.)Each
of the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one
wide, measures at most a decimetre in length.(3.9
inches.--Translator's Note.)I thought it advisable to have these short
tubes, as the Osmia is thus compelled to select different lodgings,
each of them being insufficient in itself to accommodate the total
laying.In this way I shall obtain a greater variety in the
distribution of the sexes.Lastly, at the mouth of each tube, which
projects slightly outside the case, there is a little paper tongue,
forming a sort of perch on which the Osmia alights on her arrival and
giving easy access to the house.With these facilities, the swarm
colonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes, thirty-seven cylindrical
tubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old nests of the Mason-bee
of the Shrubs.From this rich mine of material I will take what I want
to prove my case.Every series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with
males.To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in
galleries of normal diameter.In each new abode the mother busies
herself first of all with the more important sex.Bearing this point in
mind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an
inversion of this order and make the laying begin with males?I think
so, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible
conclusions to be drawn from them.The double-galleried tubes are
installed in order to put my conjectures to the proof.The back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres wide (.195 to.234
inch.--Translator's Note.), is too narrow to serve as a lodging for
normally developed females.If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very
economical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to
establish males there.And her laying must necessarily begin here,
because this corner is the rear-most part of the tube.The foremost
gallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive.Here,
finding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go
on with her laying in the order which she prefers.Of the fifty-two double-galleried
tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized.The
Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the
latter alone received the eggs.The
female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present
marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are
smaller.I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of
average dimensions.It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small
to admit the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it.When the
Osmia is unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it.She then closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and
does her laying beyond it, in the wide tube.Had I tried to avoid these
useless apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have
encountered another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding
themselves almost comfortable, would have decided to lodge females
there.I had to be prepared for it: as each mother selected her house
at will and as I was unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube
would be colonized or not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or
was not able to make her way inside.There remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized.In these there are two things to take into consideration.The narrow
rear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to.214 inch.--Translator's
Note.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,
but in short series, between one and five.The mother is here so much
hampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the
Osmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front
tube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement
necessary for her operations.The other rear tubes, the minority, whose
diameter is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.),
contain sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and
males towards the opening.One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a
mother slightly smaller would account for this difference in the
results.Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely
provided in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can
a two-sex arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only
in the last extremity.Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube
may be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and
consist of females at the back and males in front.Though incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,
the result of the experiment is none the less very remarkable.Twenty-five apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in
numbers varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of five.After these
comes the colony of the large gallery, beginning with females and
ending with males.And the layings in these apparatus do not always
belong to late summer or even to the intermediate period: a few small
tubes contain the earliest eggs of the entire swarm.A couple of
Osmiae, more forward than the others, set to work on the 23rd of April.Both of them started their laying by placing males in the narrow tubes.The meagre supply of provisions was enough in itself to show the sex,
which proved later to be in accordance with my anticipations.We see
then that, by my artifices, the whole swarm starts with the converse of
the normal order.This inversion is continued, at no matter what
period, from the beginning to the end of the operations.The series
which, according to rule, would begin with females now begins with
males.Once the larger gallery is reached, the laying is pursued in the
usual order.We have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that the
Osmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the
sequence of the sexes.Would it be possible, provided that the tube
were long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire
series of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and
the entire series of the females the roomy gallery in front?I think
not; and I will tell you why.Long and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not
because of their narrowness but because of their length.Observe that
for each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards
twice.She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup
from her crop.Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,
she goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious
performance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance
which, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the
wings are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are
liable to get rumpled or bent.She goes out backwards, reaches the
outside, turns round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way,
so as to brush off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap.If the gallery is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes
troublesome after a time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is
too small to allow of free movement.I have said that the narrow tubes
of my apparatus are, for the most part, only very incompletely
colonized.The Bee, after lodging a small number of males in them,
hastens to leave them.In the wide front gallery she can stay where she
is and still be able to turn round easily for her different
manipulations; she will avoid those two long journeys backwards, which
are so exhausting and so bad for her wings.Another reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the
narrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females
in the part where the gallery widens.The males have to leave their
cells a couple of weeks or more before the females.If they occupy the
back of the house they will die prisoners or else they will overturn
everything on their way out.This risk is avoided by the order which
the Osmia adopts.In my tubes, with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find
the dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her
disposal and there is the emergence later on.In the narrow tubes, the
width is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges
males there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented
from issuing at the proper moment.This would perhaps explain the
mother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of
