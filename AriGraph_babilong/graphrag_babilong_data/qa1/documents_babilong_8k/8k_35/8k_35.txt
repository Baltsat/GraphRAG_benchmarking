And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.Daniel went back to the garden.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band."John went back to the bathroom."I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.[Footnote 449: Be able to seal--Ver.From this, it appears to have
been a signet ring.][Footnote 450: Touch the lips.--Ver.See the Tristia, Book v., El.1 5, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 459: In her desk.--Ver.'Loculi' used in the plural,
as in the present instance, signified a receptacle with compartments,
similar, perhaps, to our writing desks; a small box, coffer, casket, or
cabinet of wood or ivory, for keeping money or jewels.]See the Note to the first line of the
First Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 461: Pelignian land.--Ver.From Pliny the Elder, we learn
that the Peligni were divided into three tribes, the Corfinienses, the
Superequani, and the Sulmonenses.][Footnote 462: Constellation.--Ver.He alludes to the heat attending
the Dog star, see the Fasti, Book iv., 1.939, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 463: The thin soil.--Ver.'Rarus ager' means, a 'thin' or
'loose' soil, which was well suited for the cultivation of the grape.][Footnote 464: That bears its berries.--Ver.In Nisard's
translation, the words 'bacciferam Pallada,' which mean the olive, are
rendered 'L'amande Caere Pallas,' 'the almond dear to Pallas.'][Footnote 465: Lengthened tracks.--Ver.To the Delphin Editor this
seems a silly expression.][Footnote 466: The stormy Alps.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
ii.[Footnote 467: The obedient stream.--Ver.This was a method of
irrigation in agriculture, much resorted to by the ancients.][Footnote 468: Fierce Cilicians --Ver.The people of the interior
of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, were of rude and savage manners while those
on the coast had been engaged in piracy, until it had been effectually
suppressed by Pompey.][Footnote 469: Britons painted green.--Ver.The Britons may be
called 'virides,' from their island being surrounded by the sea; or,
more probably, from the colour with which they were in the habit of
staining their bodies.Cæsar says, in the Fifth Book of the Gallic war,
'The Britons stain themselves with woad, 'vitrum,' or 'glastum,'
which produces a blue colour: and thus they become of a more dreadful
appearance in battle.'The conquest of Britain, by Cæsar, is alluded to
in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 471: Loves the vine.--Ver.The custom of training vines
by the side of the elm, has been alluded to in a previous Note.See also
the Metamorphoses, Book xiv.[Footnote 472: As the nags.--Ver.The'manni' were used by the
Romans for much the same purpose as our coach-horses; and were probably
more noted for their fleetness than their strength; They were a small
breed, originally imported from Gaul, and the possession of them was
supposed to indicate the possession of considerable wealth.As the
'esseda' was a small vehicle, and probably of light structure, we must
not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of driving for herself.The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety miles: and the journey,
from his expressions in the fifty-first and fifty-second lines, must
have been over hill and dale.][Footnote 473: Your little chaise.--Ver.For an account of the
'essedum,' or 'esseda,' see the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.34,
and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 474: King of Pkthia.--Ver.He alludes to the marriage of
Thetis, the sea Goddess, to Peleus, the king of Phthia, in Thessaly.]John went to the bedroom.[Footnote 475: His anvil.--Ver.It is a somewhat curious fact,
that the anvils of the ancients exactly resembled in form and every
particular those used at the present day.][Footnote 476: Becomingly united.--Ver.He says, that in the
Elegiac measure the Pentameter, or line of five feet, is not unhappily
matched with the Hexameter, or heroic line of six feet.][Footnote 477: Disavowed by you.--Ver.'Voids' seems more agreable
to the sense of the passage, than 'nobis.''to be denied by us;' as,
from the context, there was no fear of his declining her affection.][Footnote 478: That she is Corinna.--Ver.This clearly proves that
Corinna was not a real name; it probably was not given by the Poet to
any one of his female acquaintances in particular.]Daniel moved to the bathroom.[Footnote 479: Thy poem onwards.--Ver.Macer translated the Iliad of
Homer into Latin verse, and composed an additional poem, commencing
at the beginning of the Trojan war, and coming down to the wrath of
Achilles, with which Homer begins.][Footnote 480: I, Macer.--Ver.Æmilius Macer is often mentioned
by Ovid in his works.10,1.41, he says,
'Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me his poem on
birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb that is curative.'The
Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic Epistles is also addressed to
him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on the Trojan war, and the time
when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily together.He speaks of him in
the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as being then dead.Macer was
a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend of Virgil, Ovid, and
Tibullus.Some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history, was
not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war; and, indeed, it does
not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should
be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six
years of age.The bard of Ilium died in Asia.][Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver.He alludes to his tragedy
of Medea, which no longer exists.Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The
Medea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had
only preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'][Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver.He represents his friend,
Sabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,'
going with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and
bringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra,
Æneas to Dido, Demophoôn to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to
Sappho.All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of
Ulysses to Penelope, and Demophoôn to Phyllis.His Epistle from Paris
to Oenonc, is not here mentioned.See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver.As the ancients had
no establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special
messengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.][Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver.Sappho says in her Epistle,
that if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to
Phobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock.This, he tells her,
she may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.][Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver.She pretended a head-ache,
when nothing wras the matter with her; in order that too much
familiarity, in the end, might not breed contempt.][Footnote 486: A surfeit of love.--Ver.'l'inguis amor' seems here
to mear a satisfied 'ora 'pampered passion;' one that meets with no
repulse.][Footnote 487: Enclosed Danaë.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
iv., 1.][Footnote 488: The dogs bark.--Ver.The women of loose character,
among the Romans, were much in the habit of keeping dogs, for the
protection of their houses.]FOOTNOTES BOOK THREE:

[Footnote 501: Than the other.--Ver.'He alludes to the unequal
lines of the Elegiac measure, which consists of Hexameters and
Pentameters.In personifying Elegy, he might have omitted this remark,
as it does not add to the attractions of a lady, to have one foot longer
than the other; he says, however, that it added to her gracefulness.][Footnote 502: The Lydian buskin.--Ver.As Lydia was said to
have sent colonists to Etruria, some Commentators think that the word
'Lydius' here means 'Etrurian and that the first actors at Rome were
Etrurians.But, as the Romans derived their notions of tragedy from the
Greeks, we may conclude that Lydia in Asia Minor is here referred
to; for we learn from Herodotus and other historians, that the Greeks
borrowed largely from the Lydians.][Footnote 503: Drunken revels.--Ver.He probably alludes to the
Fourth Elegy of the First, and the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the
'Amores.']The 'thyrsus' was said to
have been first used by the troops of Bacchus, in his Indian expedition,
when, to deceive the Indians, they concealed the points of their spears
amid leaves of the vine and ivy.Similar weapons were used by his
devotees when worshipping him, which they brandished to and fro.To be
touched with the thyrsus of Bacchus, meant 'to be inspired with poetic
frenzy.'See the Notes to the Metamorphoses, Book iii.[Footnote 506: In unequal numbers.--Ver.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Some have supposed, that
allusion is made to the Tragedy of Medea, which Ovid had composed, and
that it had been written in Elegiac measure.This, however, does not
seem to be the meaning of the passage.Elegy justly asks Tragedy, why,
if she has such a dislike to Elegiac verses, she has been talking in
them?which she has done, from the 15th line to the 30th.][Footnote 507: Myself the patroness.--Ver.Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.She certainly does
not give herself a very high character in giving herself the title of
'lena.'][Footnote 508: The fastened door.--Ver.He alludes, probably, to
one of the Elegies which he rejected, when he cut down the five books to
three.][Footnote 509: In a hose tunic.--Ver.He may possibly allude to the
Fifth Elegy of the First Book, as the words 'tunicâ velata recinctâ,' as
applied to Corinna, are there found.But there he mentions midday as the
time when Corinna came to him, whereas he seems here to allude to the
middle of the night.][Footnote 510: Cut in the wood.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
lovers carving inscriptions on the doors of their obdurate mistresses:
this we learn from Plautus to have been done in Elegiac strains, and
sometimes with charcoal.'Implentur meæ fores clegiarum carbonibus.''My
doors are filled with the coal-black marks of elegies.'][Footnote 511: On her birthday.--Ver.She is telling Ovid what she
has put up with for his sake; and she reminds him how, when he sent to
his mistress some complimentary lines on her birthday, she tore them
up and threw them in the water.Horace mentions 'the flames, or the
Adriatic sea,' as the end of verses that displeased.Athenseus, Book
xiii.5, relates a somewhat similai story.Diphilus the poet was in
the habit of sending his verses to his mistress Gnathæna.One day she
was mixing him a cup of wine and snow-water, on which he observed, how
cold her well must be; to which she answered, yes, for it was there that
she used to throw his compositions.][Footnote 514: From behind.--Ver.It is not known, for certain, to
what he refers in this line.Some think that he refers to the succeeding
Elegies in this Book, which are, in general, longer than the former
ones, while others suppose that he refers to his Metamorphoses, which he
then contemplated writing.Burmann, however, is not satisfied with this
explanation, and thinks that, in his more mature years, he contemplated
the composition of Tragedy, after having devoted his youth to lighter
snbjects; and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the
composition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.][Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver.He is here alluding to
the Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or
greatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year.Some account
is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1.392. of the Second Book
of the Fasti.The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the
Fourth of the Ides of April.The buildings of the Circus were burnt in
the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored
till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former
magnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of
accommodating 385,000 persons.The Poet says, that he takes no
particular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may
win which is her favourite.][Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver.The usual number of
chariots in each race was four.The charioteers were divided into four
companies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing
the season of the year.These colours were green for the spring, red for
the summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter.Originally,
but two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number
to six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the
purple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four.The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in
the race.Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and
colours; the names also of the charioteers were given, and bets were
extensively made, (see the Art of Love, Book i.167, 168,) and
sometimes disputes and violent contests arose.][Footnote 517: To be seated by you.--Ver.The men and women sat
together when viewing the contests of the Circus, and not in separate
parts of the building, as at the theatres.][Footnote 518: Happy the driver.--Ver.[Footnote 519: The sacred barrier.--Ver.For an account of the
'career,' or'starting-place,' see the Notes to the Tristia, Book v. El.It is called'sacer,' because the whole of the Circus Maximus
was sacred to Consus, who is supposed by some to have been the same
Deity as Neptune.Sandra went back to the office.The games commenced with sacrifices to the Deities.][Footnote 520: I would give rein.--Ver.The charioteer was wont
to stand within the reins, having them thrown round his back.Leaning
backwards, he thereby threw his full weight against the horses, when
he wished to check them at full speed.This practice, however, was
dangerous, and by it the death of Hippolytus was caused.In the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses,1.524, he says, 'I struggled,
with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and
throwing myself "backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.'To avoid
the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked knife at
his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.]Daniel travelled to the bedroom.[Footnote 521: The turning-place.--Ver.'see the Tristia, Book iv.Of course, thpse who
kept as close to the'meta' as possible, would lose the least distance
in turning round it.][Footnote 522: How nearly was Pelops.--Ver.In his race with
Onomaüs, king of Pisa, in Arcadia, for the hand of his daughter,
Hippodamia, when Pelops conquered his adversary by bribing his
charioteer, Myrtilus.][Footnote 523: Of his mistress.--Ver.He here seems to imply that
it was Hippodamia who bribed Myrtilus.][Footnote 524: Shrink away in vain.--Ver.She shrinks from him, and
seems to think that he is sitting too close, but he tells her that the
'linea' forces them to squeeze.This 'linea' is supposed to have been
either cord, or a groove, drawn across the seats at regular intervals,
so as to mark out room for a certain number of spectators between each
two 'lineæ.'][Footnote 525: Has this advantage.--Ver.He congratulates himsdf on
the construction of the place, so aptly giving him an excuse for sitting
close to his mistress.][Footnote 526: But do you --Ver.He is pretending to be very
anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not
