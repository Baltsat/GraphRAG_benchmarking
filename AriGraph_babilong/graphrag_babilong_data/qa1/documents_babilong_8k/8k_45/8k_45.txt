Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.Sandra travelled to the hallway.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Mary moved to the office.Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'He had been so fortunate
that he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind,
when his attention was suddenly drawn to him.Just in front of him he
saw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth,
and both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.He was strolling
along in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy
whom he had so meanly robbed.Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his
pace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan."Anyway, he
can't prove anything."What brings _you_ over here, Mike?""I'm looking for a job," said Mike."You look like it," retorted Dan, "with both hands in your pockets and
a cigar in your mouth!"I don't know," answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood."A man gave it
to me for holdin' his hoss."Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie."Did they let you over the ferry free, then?""Oh, I had money enough for that.""Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?"Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this
unexpected question."Terence told me you had invited him."said Mike, his self-assurance returning."Look here, Mike Rafferty," said Dan, out of patience; "that won't go
down!I know where you got the money you were
going to treat him with.""It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making
any more trouble, I'll have you arrested."We're in Jersey----"

"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.""I didn't take the money," said Mike, sullenly."You did, and you know it," said Dan, firmly."Give me what you have
left, and I'll make no trouble about it.If you don't, you're booked for
another term at the island."Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and
finally extracted from him four dollars and a half.The rest Mike
pretended he had spent.He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough
to take him to the Old Bowery.On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had
received on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a
farewell shot."How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?""That is my first appearance as a detective," thought Dan.It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found
himself again in front of the Astor House.I've
made enough to satisfy me for one day."Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying
crowds.He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and
he felt like a gentleman of leisure.All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob.It proceeded from a
little flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the
little flower-girl was one of his acquaintances."Haven't you sold as
many bouquets as usual?""Yes," said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, "I've sold more.""No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me."He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in
appearance and unmistakably bad.A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave
me this to change.""Didn't you see that it was bad?""I didn't look at it till afterward."So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?""Yes," said the little girl, again beginning to sob."How many bouquets had you sold?""Then you have less money than when you began?""Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?""No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.""Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him.Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run."I hope he won't have taken the boat," he said to himself."If he has I
shall lose him."Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but
did not stop to apologize.He ran into a fat gentleman who looked
daggers at him, but kept on.Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat
as it was leaving the New York pier.Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.I'll go forward," said Dan to himself.He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward
deck.The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in
Brooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.Dan looked about him for a time without success, but all at once his
eyes lighted up.Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's
cabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his
hand.His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of
meanness.Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's
character can be read upon his face."That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat," Dan decided
within himself.He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the
same age."Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?""Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House," answered
Sanderson."I suppose it is meant for some young lady," suggested the other."Maybe it is," answered Sanderson, with a grin.Dan thought it was about time to come to business.He touched the red-haired young man on the arm."You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House," said Dan.asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of
what was coming."You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment," continued Dan."I am sorry I cannot accommodate you," said Dan, "but I want you to give
me a good piece for this first.""I never saw that half-dollar before," said Sanderson."Perhaps you can prove that before the court," said Dan."I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a
good piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the
pier," said Dan, firmly.Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed."Fanny is a poor girl," he said."I found her crying over her loss, for
it was more than all the money she had taken to-day.""Yes, I am," said Dan, stoutly."This is a put-up job between you two," said Sanderson."Gentlemen," said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him,
"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl.exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried "shame!"with
looks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair."I don't believe a word of it," he ejaculated, in a rage."But I'll give you the money to get rid of you," and he threw a
half-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable."Thank you, sir; here's your money," said Dan.Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar,
he took it and put it carefully in his pocket."Keep it to pay your washerwoman with," said a jeering voice.It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away
from the unfriendly crowd.cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan."How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the
coin."He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name


     BARTON & ROGERS,
     Commission Merchants,
               No.Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave
little thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an
important influence on his fortunes.He took the same boat back to New
York, and hurried to the Astor House.Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still
standing in her wonted place."I've got your money back, Fanny," said Dan."Yes; I made the fellow give it up.""Oh, how kind you are, Dan!"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall
lady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.As Dan was about
turning away, she placed her hand on his arm."Young man," she said, "I want to speak to you.""All right, ma'am," said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to
send him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,
and grave in appearance."Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?""There is only one of me," answered Dan, humorously."If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.""Yes," answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be
only curiosity on the part of the lady.She noticed at once the change
in his manner."I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity," she said, quickly."I have an object in what I ask.""All right, ma'am," he said; "I am ready to answer.""Are you at leisure for an hour or two?""I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper," he
said, hesitating."Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl
know where you live?""Little girl," she said, "go at once and tell this boy's mother that he
will not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents
in her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of
him.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to
explain his absence to his mother?"Now," said the lady, "if you will hail the next stage we will go up
town."Soon they were rattling over the pavements
through thronged Broadway.It was two years since Dan had been in a
Broadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but
when it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly
opposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his
side.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.Of
course he did not betray any mark of recognition."I like riding in a Broadway stage," he heard the young lady say."There
is more to see as you go along."Not always," said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it."The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage," said the
young lady."It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.""How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?"John went back to the kitchen."I give it up," said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look."Yes," answered Dan, "I used to know him.""I don't," said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first
time that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in
company."What can they have to do with each other?""She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed."At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a
polite bow."Thank you," said the young lady, with a pleasant smile."You needn't have troubled yourself," said Tom Carver, irritated."This
young lady is under _my_ charge.""It is no trouble, I assure you," answered Dan."He is very polite," said the young lady, in a low voice, "and very
good-looking, too," she added, with a second look at Dan."He is only a common newsboy," said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's
tribute to a boy he disliked."I can't help what he is," said the young lady, independently; "he looks
like a gentleman."Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his
face flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not
being addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise."He lives at the Five Points somewhere," muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only
smiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square."Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?"He got out first, and helped his companion out."Follow me into the hotel," she said.asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs.John went to the office."I needn't ask if you have a good mother?""One of the best," said Dan, promptly."You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the
sofa beside her."You have already told me that you have no sister," she began."Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?""I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons
unnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for a time.Do you think your
mother would be willing to take charge of her?Of course I would make it
worth her while.""I am sure she would like it," said Dan, for he saw at a glance that
this would be a very desirable arrangement for them."Then you feel authorized to accept the charge in your mother's name?"Your mother would be willing to
teach her until such time as she may be old enough to go to school?""I think little girls are best off at home until the age of seven or
eight.""We live in a poor room and a poor neighborhood."I shall pay you enough to enable you to
take better rooms.""I may as well be explicit," said the lady."I propose to pay fifty
dollars a month for my ward's board, including, of course, your mothers
care.""I am afraid it won't be worth it," said Dan, frankly."If Althea is well cared for, as I am sure she will be, I shall have no
fear of that.Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per
month extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all.For the
present that will probably be enough.""Oh, yes, I should think so," said Dan."When do you want her to come to
us?"I must leave New York early to-morrow.In fact, I leave
the city by an early train.""She would have to come to our poor lodgings," said Dan, hesitatingly.To-morrow you can secure rooms up town.""Yes, ma'am, I will."Now," said the lady, rising, "since the matter is settled, come up
stairs with me, and I will show you the child."Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a
very pleasant one.As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,
ran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand."I'm so glad you've got home, auntie," she said."I staid away longer than I intended, Althea," said the lady."I was
afraid you would feel lonely."I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a
little girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find
me."I have brought you a playfellow, Althea."This drew the little girl's attention to Dan.Unlike most girls of her
age, she was not bashful.Are you going to live with us, Dan?""You are coming to live with me," said Dan, smiling.You are nice-looking," said Althea, in a
matter-of-fact tone.He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a
little girl."So are you, Althea," he said."I don't think I am," said Althea."I've black hair, and my skin is
dark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.""Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not."You will like to live with Dan, my dear?""I have got to go away--on business.""I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said."Dan and I can't live
alone.""Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."asked Althea, brightening up."And you will come to see me some time, auntie?""Then I will go with Dan;" and the little girl placed her hand
confidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he
knew that it would brighten his mother's existence."Shall we go now, madam?"She drew from her pocket a wallet
containing a considerable sum of money."I will hand you two months' payment in advance," she said, "and
afterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for
money.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and
twenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty."Whenever I have any to be careful about," answered Dan."I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a
little trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write
you an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before
carrying it away."Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.""I'm afraid I don't look fit."At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the
supper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his
seat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually
stood in front of the Astor House!The young lady whom Tom Carver was escorting boarded at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, and had alighted at the same time with our hero, though he did
not observe it.Tom had been invited to supper, and, with Julia and her father, was
seated at a neighboring table when Dan entered.Tom could hardly credit his eyes when he saw Dan entering the
supper-room, with the little girl clinging to his hand.he ejaculated, forgetting his manners in his
surprise."I beg your pardon, but I was so astonished.There is that newsboy
coming into supper!""What a pretty little girl is with him!""You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy.""Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend.I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House.""His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.""Of that boy at the next table, pa."Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat.Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting."Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?""There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street."Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling."Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia.""I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr."You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it.""Dan, this young gentleman is Thomas Carver.Carver a long time," said Dan, smiling."You didn't tell me that, Tom," said Julia Rogers, turning to Tom."No," said Tom, embarrassed; "it is a good while ago.""I won't detain you any longer from your friends," said Mr."I shall see you at the office in the morning.""Where did you meet him, papa?"Her father told the story of Dan's exploit on the ferry-boat."He is a very smart boy," he said."I shall probably take him into my
employ."All this was very disagreeable to Tom Carver, but he did not venture to
say all that he felt, being somewhat in awe of Mr."They are making a great fuss over a common newsboy," he muttered to
himself.After supper, Dan prepared to take Althea home with him.She felt so
well acquainted already that she made no objection, but, hand-in-hand,
left the hotel with Dan.He halted a Broadway stage, and they got in."Are you carrying me to where you live, Dan?""Will your mother be glad to see me?"She wants a little girl to keep her
company."Mordaunt was apprised by Fanny that Dan had gone up town with a
lady, and therefore was not alarmed when he did not return home at the
usual time.She hoped he would clear fifty cents, but had no idea to
what extent their fortunes would be advanced by Dan's evening's work."I will save Dan some supper," she said to herself.So, mother-like, she supped economically herself, on a cup of tea and
some dry bread, and bought a bit of steak for Dan's supper, for she
thought he would be very hungry at so late an hour.It was nearly half-past eight when she heard Dan's well known step on
the stairs.She opened the door to welcome him, but the cheerful welcome upon her
lips died away in surprise when she saw his companion."She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does
