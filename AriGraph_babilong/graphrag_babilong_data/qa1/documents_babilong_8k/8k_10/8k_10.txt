I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!He will make a fine
 fellow and be a comfort to his parents, and an honour to his tutor.’

John Inglis received a nomination for Haileybury College from one of
the directors of the East India Company, and went there as a student in
1839.There he was noted as a cricketer and a good horseman, and also
for his reading.He knew Shakespeare almost by heart, and could tell
where to find any quotation from his works.On leaving Haileybury he
sailed for Calcutta, and was there for two years learning the language.He married in 1846, and in
1847 he was transferred to the newly-acquired province of the Punjab.He was sent as magistrate to Sealkote, remaining there till 1856.He then brought his family home on three years’ furlough.With the
outbreak of the Mutiny all civilians were recalled, and he returned to
India in 1858.He was sent to Bareilly to take part in the suppression
of the Mutiny, and was attached to the force under General Jones.He
was present at the action at Najibabad, with the recapture of Bareilly,
and the pacification of the province of Rohilcund.He remained in the
province ten years till 1868, and during those years he rose to be
Commissioner of Rohilcund.In 1868 he was made a member of the Board
of Revenue in the North-West Provinces.As a member of the Legislative
Council of India, he moved, in 1873, to Calcutta.From 1875 to 1877 he
was Chief Commissioner of Oude.The position Inglis made for himself in India, in yet early life, is
to be gauged by a letter written in 1846 by Sir Frederick Currie, who
was then Commissioner of Lahore.Thomasen (Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.P.)for young civilians for the work which is now before us, and we must
 take several with us into the Punjab.One whom he strongly recommends
 is Inglis at Agra.Sir Henry
 Hardinge (the Governor-General) has not seen the letter yet.“Another
 man who might suit you is Inglis at Agra; an assistant on £400,
 acting as joint magistrate which gives him one hundred more.Active,
 energetic, conciliating to natives, fine-tempered, and thoroughly
 honest in all his works.I am not sure that he is not as good a man as
 you can have.I shall be glad to hear that you send for him.”’

The letter was addressed to Inglis’ eighteen-year-old bride, and Sir
Frederick goes on:--

 ‘Shall I send for him or not?I am almost sure I should have done
 so, had I not heard of your getting hold of his heart.We don’t
 want _heartless_ men, but really you have no right to keep _such_ a
 man from us.At the present moment, however, for your sake, little
 darling, I won’t take him from his present work, but if, after the
 honeymoon, he would prefer active and stirring employment, with the
 prospect of distinction, to the light-winged toys of feathered cupid,
 I dare say I shall be able to find an opening for him.’

Mr.Inglis’ wife was Harriet Louis Thompson, one of nine daughters.Her father was one of the first Indian civilians in the old company’s
days.All of the nine sisters married men in the Indian Civil, with
the exception of one who married an army officer.Harriet came out
to her parents in India when she was seventeen, and she married in
her eighteenth year.She must have been a girl of marked character
and ability.She met her future husband at a dance in her father’s
house, and she appears to have been the first to introduce the waltz
into India.She was a fine rider, and often drove tandem in India.She must have had a steady nerve, for her letters are full of various
adventures in camp and tiger-haunted jungles, and most of them narrate
the presence of one of her infants who was accompanying the parents on
their routine of Indian official life.Her daughter says of her:--

 ‘She was deeply religious.Some years after their marriage, when she
 must have been a little over thirty and was alone in England with the
 six elder children, she started and ran most successfully a large
 working-men’s club in Southampton.Such a thing was not as common
 as it is to-day.There she lectured on Sunday evenings on religious
 subjects to the crowded hall of men.’

In the perfectly happy home of the Inglis family in India, the Indian
ayah was one of the household in love and service to those she served.Sandra went to the hallway.Simson has supplied some memories of this faithful retainer:--

 ‘The early days, the nursery days in the life of a family, are always
 looked back upon with loving interest, and many of us can trace to
 them many sweet and helpful influences.So it was with our early days,
 though the nursery was in India, and the dear nurse who lives in
 our memories was an Indian.She came into
 our family when the eldest of us was born, and remained one of the
 household for more than thirty years.Her husband came with her, and
 in later years three of her sons were table servants.Sona came home
 with us in 1857, and remained in England till the beginning of 1858.It was a sign of great attachment to us, for she left her own family
 away up in the Punjab, and fared out in the long sea voyage, into a
 strange country and among new peoples.She made friends wherever she
 was, and her stay in England was a great help to her in after life.When I returned to India after my school life at home, I found the
 dear nurse of my childhood days installed again as nurse to the little
 sisters and brother I found there.‘She was a sweet, gentle woman, and we never learnt anything but kind,
 gentle ways from her.By the time I returned she was recognised by the
 whole compound of servants as one to be looked up to and respected.She became a Christian and was baptized in 1877, but long before
 she made profession of her faith by baptism she lived a consistent
 Christian life.My dear mother’s influence was strong with her, and
 she was a reader of the Bible.One of my earliest recollections is our
 reading together the fourteenth chapter of St.‘She died some years after we had all settled in Scotland.My parents
 left her, with a small pension for life, in charge of the missionaries
 at Lucknow.When she died, they wrote to us saying that old Sona had
 been one of the pillars of the Indian Christian Church in Lucknow.‘We look forward with a sure and certain hope to our reunion in the
 home of many mansions, with her, around whom our hearts still cling
 with love and affection.’

In 1856 Mr.Inglis resolved to come home on furlough, accompanied by
Mrs.Inglis, and what was called ‘the first family,’ namely, the six
boys and one girl born to them in India.It was a formidable journey
to accomplish even without children, and one writes, ‘How mother stood
it all I cannot imagine.’ They came down from the Punjab to Calcutta
trekking in dâk garris.It took four months to reach Calcutta by this
means of progression, and another four months to come home by the Cape.The wonderful ayah, Sona, was a great help in the toilsome journey when
they brought the children back to England.Inglis was soon to
have her first parting with her husband.When they landed in England,
news of the outbreak of the Mutiny met them, and Mr.Inglis returned
almost at once to take his place beside John Lawrence.Together they
fought through the Mutiny, and then he worked under him.Inglis was
one of John Lawrence’s men in the great settling of the Punjab which
followed on that period of stress and strain in the Empire of India.His own district was Bareilly, and the house where he lived in Sealkote
is still known as Inglis Sahib ke koti (Inglis Sahib’s house).His
children remember the thrilling stories he used to tell them of these
great days, and of the great men who made their history.His admiration was unbounded for those northern races of India.He
loved and respected them, and they, in their turn, gave him unbounded
confidence and affection.‘Every bit as good as an Englishman,’ was a
phrase often on his lips when speaking of the fine Sikhs and Punjabis
and Rajpoots.Englishwomen were not allowed in India during this period, and Mrs.Inglis had to remain in Southampton with her six children and their
ayah.It was then that she found work in her leisure time for the work
she did in the Men’s Club.In 1863, when life in India had resumed its normal course, Mrs.Inglis
rejoined her husband, leaving the children she had brought back at home.It must have taken all the ‘fortitude’ that Mary Deas had shown long
before in Carolina to face this separation.There was no prospect of
the running backwards and forwards, which steam was so soon to develop,
and to draw the dominions into closer bonds.Letters took months to
pass, and no cable carried the messages of life and death across ‘the
white-lipped seas.’ Again, one of the survivors says: ‘I always felt
even as a child, and am sure of it now, she left her heart behind with
the six elder children.What it must have meant to a woman of her deep
nature, I cannot imagine.’ The decision was made, and Mr.Inglis was to
have the great reward of her return to him, after his seven years of
strenuous and anxious loneliness.The boys were sent, three of them to
Eton, and two more to Uppingham and to Rugby.Amy Inglis the daughter
was left with friends.Relatives were not lacking in this large clan
and its branches, and the children were ‘looked after’ by them.We owe
much of our knowledge of ‘the second little family,’ which were to
comfort the parents in India, by the correspondence concerning them
with the dearly-loved children left in the homelands.CHAPTER II

ELSIE MAUD INGLIS

1864-1917

    ‘Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the
    womb is His reward.As arrows are in the hand of the mighty man, so
    are children of the youth.Happy is the man that hath his quiver
    full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with
    the enemies in the gate.’


      NAINI TAL, _Aug.‘MY DARLING AMY,--Thank God, I am able to tell you that your dearest
 mother, and your little sister who was born this morning are well.Aunt Ellen thinks that baby is very like your dearest mother, but I
 do not see the resemblance at present.We
 could not form a better wish for her, than that she may grow up like
 her dear mother in every respect.Old Sona is quite delighted to have
 another baby to look after again.She took possession of her the
 moment she was born, as she has done with all of you.The nurse says
 she is a very strong and healthy baby.I wish to tell you as early as
 possible the good news of God’s great mercy and goodness towards us in
 having brought your dearest mother safely through this trial.’

Mrs.Inglis writes a long account of Elsie at a month old, and says she
is supposed to have a temper, as she makes herself heard all over the
house, and strongly objects to being brought indoors and put into her
cradle.In October she writes how the two babies, her own and Aunt Ellen’s
little boy, had been taken to church to be baptized, the one by the
name of Elsie Maude, the other Cyril Powney.Both children were
thriving, and no one would know that there were two babies in the
house.‘Elsie always stares very hard at papa when he comes to speak
to her, as if she did not quite know what to make of his black beard,
something different to what she is accustomed to see, but she generally
ends by laughing at him’--the first notice of that radiant friendship
in which father and daughter were to journey together in a happy
pilgrimage through life.Elsie had early to make long driving expeditions with her parents, and
her mother reports her as ‘accommodating herself to circumstances,
watching the trees, sleeping under them, and the jolliest little
traveller I ever saw.’

In December 1864 Mrs.Inglis reports their return from camp:--

 ‘It has been most extraordinarily warm for the time of year, and
 there has been very little rain during the whole twelvemonth.People
 attribute it to the wonderful comet which has been visible in the
 southern hemisphere.Elsie is very well, but she is a very little
 thing with a very wee face.She has a famous pair of large blue eyes,
 and it is quite remarkable how she looks about her and seems to
 observe everything.She lies in her bed at night in the dark and talks
 away out loud in her own little language, and little voice, and she is
 always ready for a laugh.’

Later on Mrs.Inglis writes: ‘I think she is one of the most
intelligent babies I ever met with.’

Every letter descriptive of the dark, blue-eyed baby with the fast
growing light hair, speaks of the smile ready for every one who speaks
to her, and the hearty laughs which seem to have been one of her
earliest characteristics.One journey tried Elsie’s philosophy of taking life as she found it.Inglis writes to her daughter:--

      NAINI TAL, 1865.‘We came in palkies from Beharin to a place called Jeslie, half way
 up the hill to Naini Tal, and were about ten hours in the palkies.I
 had arranged to have Elsie with me in my palkie, but the little monkey
 did not like being away from Sona, and then the strangeness of the
 whole proceedings bewildered her, and the noise of the bearers seemed
 to frighten her, so I was obliged to make her over to Sona.She went
 to sleep after a little while.As we came near the hills it became
 cold and a wind got up, and then Papa brought her back to me, for we
 did not quite like her being in Sona’s doolie, which was not so well
 protected as mine.She had become more reconciled to the disagreeables
 of dâk travelling by that time.We reached our house about nine
 o’clock yesterday morning.The change from the dried-up hot plains is
 very pleasant.You may imagine how often I longed for the railroad and
 our civilised English way of travelling.’

Mrs.Shaw M‘Laren, the companion sister of Elsie, and to whom her
correspondence always refers, has written down some memories of the
happy childhood days in India.The year was divided between the plains
and the hills of India.Elsie was born in August 1864, at Naini Tal,
one of the most beautiful hill stations in the Himalayas.From the
verandah, where much of the day was spent, the view was across the
masses of ‘huddled hills’ to the ranges crowned by the everlasting
snows.An outlook of silent and majestic stillness, and one which
could not fail to influence such a spirit as shone out in the always
wonderful eyes of Elsie.She grew up with the vision of the glory of
the earthly dominion, and it gave a new meaning to the kingdom of the
things of the spirit.‘All our childhood is full of remembrances of “Father.” He never
 forgot our birthdays; however hot it was down in the scorched plains,
 when the day came round, if we were up in the hills, a large parcel
 would arrive from him.Daniel went back to the kitchen.His very presence was joy and strength when he
 came to us at Naini Tal.What a remembrance there is of early walks
 and early breakfasts with him and the three of us.The table was
 spread in the verandah between six and seven.Father made three cups
 of cocoa, one for each of us, and then the glorious walk!Three ponies
 followed behind, each with their attendant grooms, and two or three
 red-coated chaprasis, father stopping all along the road to talk to
 every native who wished to speak to him, while we three ran about,
 laughing and interested in everything.Then, at night, the shouting
 for him after we were in bed and father’s step bounding up the stair
 in Calcutta, or coming along the matted floor of our hill home.All
 order and quietness flung to the winds while he said good night to us.‘It was always understood that Elsie and he were special chums, but
 that never made any jealousy.The three cups
 of cocoa were exactly the same in quality and quantity.We got equal
 shares of his right and his left hand in our walks, but Elsie and he
 were comrades, inseparables from the day of her birth.‘In the background of our lives there was always the quiet strong
 mother, whose eyes and smile live on through the years.Every morning
 before the breakfast and walk, there were five minutes when we sat
 in front of her in a row on little chairs in her room and read the
 scripture verses in turn, and then knelt in a straight, quiet row and
 repeated the prayers after her.Only once can I remember father being
 angry with any of us, and that was when one of us ventured to hesitate
 in instant obedience to some wish of hers.I still see the room in
 which it happened, and the thunder in his voice is with me still.’

Both Mr.Inglis belonged to the Anglican Church, though they
never hesitated to go to any denomination where they found the best
spiritual life.Mary travelled to the garden.In later life in Edinburgh, they were connected with
the Free Church of Scotland.John moved to the garden.To again quote from his daughter: ‘His
religious outlook was magnificently broad and beautiful, and his belief
in God simple and profound.His devotion to our mother is a thing
impossible to speak about, but we all feel that in some intangible way
it influenced and beautified our childhood.’

In 1870 Mrs.Inglis writes of the lessons of Elsie and her sister Eva.Marwood, is successful as a teacher; it comes easy
enough to Elsie to learn, and she delights in stories being told her.Every morning after their early morning walk, and while their baths
are being got ready, their mother says they come to her to say their
prayers and learn their Bible lesson.’ There are two letters more or
less composed by Elsie and written by her father.In as far as they
were dictated by herself, they take stock of independent ways, and the
spirit of the Pharisee is early developed in the courts of the Lord’s
House, as she manages not to fall asleep all the time, while the weaker
little sister slumbers and sleeps.Eva, the sleepy sister, has some further reminiscences of these nursery
days:--

 ‘We had forty dolls!Elsie decreed once that they should all have
 measles--so days were spent by us three painting little red dots all
 over the forty faces and the forty pairs of arms and legs.She was the
 doctor and prescribed gruesome drugs which we had to administer.Then
 it was decreed that they should slowly recover, so each day so many
 spots were washed off until the epidemic was wiped out!‘Another time one of the forty dolls was lost!Maria was small and
 ugly, but much loved, and the search for her was _tremendous_, but
 unsuccessful.After all there were
 plenty other dolls--never mind Maria!Father would find her when he came home from Kutcherry
 in the evening, if nobody else could.So father was told with many
 tears of Maria’s disappearance.The
 next day all the enormous staff of Indian servants, numbering all
 told about thirty or so, were had up in a row and told that unless
 Maria was found sixpence would be cut from each servant’s pay for
 interminable months!and Maria came to light
 within half an hour--in the pocket of one of the dresses of her little
 mistress found by one of the ayahs!Her mistress declared at the time,
 and always maintained with undiminished certainty, that she had first
 been put there, and then found by the ayah in question during that
 half-hour’s search!’

These reminiscences have more of interest than just the picture of
the little child who was to carry on the early manifestations of a
keen interest in life.A smile, surely one of the clouds of glory she
trailed from heaven, and carried back untarnished by the tragedies of a
stricken earth; they are chiefly valuable in the signs of a steadfast,
independent will.The interest of all Elsie’s early development lay in
the comradeship with a father whose wide benevolence and understanding
love was to be the guide and helper in his daughter’s career.Not for
the first time in the history of outstanding lives, the daughter has
been the friend, and not the subjugated child of a selfish and dominant
parent.The date of Elsie’s birth was in the dawn of the movement which
believed it possible that women could have a mind and a brain of their
own, and that the freedom of the one and the cultivation of the other
was not a menace to the possessive rights of the family, or the ruin
of society at large.Thousands of women born at the same date were
instructed that the aim of their lives must be to see to the creature
comforts of their male parent, and when he was taken from them, to
believe it right that he had neither educated them, nor made provision
for the certain old age and spinsterdom which lay before the majority.There have been many parents who gave their daughters no reason to
call them blessed, when they were left alone unprovided with gear or
education.In all periods of family history, such instances as Mr.Inglis’ outlook for his daughters is uncommon.He desired for them
equal opportunities, and the best and highest education.He gave them
the best of his mind, not its dregs, and a comradeship which made a
rare and happy entrance for them into life’s daily toil and struggle.The father asked for nothing but their love, and he had his own
unselfish devotion returned to him a hundredfold.It must have been a great joy to him to watch the unfolding of talent
and great gifts in this daughter who was always ‘his comrade.’ He could
not live to see the end of a career so blessed, so rich in womanly
grace and sustaining service, but he knew he had spared no good thing
he could bring into her life, and when her mission was fulfilled, then,
those who read and inwardly digest these pages will feel that she first
learnt the secret of service to mankind in the home of her father.CHAPTER III

THE LADDER OF LEARNING

1876-1885

    ‘Hast thou come with the heart of thy childhood back:
      The free, the pure, the kind?So murmured the trees in my homeward track,
      As they played to the mountain wind.‘Hath thy soul been true to its early love?Hath the spirit nurs’d amid hill and grove,
      Still revered its first high dream?’


After Mr.Inglis had been Chief Commissioner of Oude, he decided
to retire from his long and arduous service.Had he been given the
Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-West, as was expected by some in
the service, he would probably have accepted it and remained longer in
India.He was not in sympathy with Lord Lytton’s Afghan policy, and
that would naturally alter his desire for further employment.As with his father before him, his work was highly appreciated
by those he served.Lord Lytton, the Viceroy, in a letter to Lord
Salisbury, then Secretary of State for India, writes, February 1876:--

 ‘During the short period of my own official tenure I have met with
 much valuable assistance from Mr.Inglis, both as a member of my
 Legislative Council, and also as officiating Commissioner in Oudh,
 more especially as regards the amalgamation of Oudh with the N.W.Of his character and abilities I have formed so high an
 opinion that had there been an available vacancy I should have been
 glad to secure to my government his continued services.’

Two of Mr.Inglis’ sons had settled in Tasmania, and it was decided to
go there before bringing home the younger members of his family.Simson, was now married and settled in Edinburgh,
and the Inglis determined to make their home in that city.Two years were spent in Hobart settling the two sons on the land.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘When in Tasmania, Elsie and I went to a very good school.Miss Knott,
 the head-mistress, had come out from Cheltenham College for Girls.Here in the days when such things were practically unknown, Elsie,
 backed by Miss Knott, instituted ‘school colours.’ They were very
 primitive, not beautiful hatbands, but two inches of blue and white
 ribbon sewn on to a safety pin, and worn on the lapel of our coats.John went to the bathroom.How proud we were of them.’

Mr.Inglis, writing to his daughter in Edinburgh, says of their school
life:--

 ‘Elsie has done very well, she is in the second class and last week
 got up to second in the class.‘We are all in a whirl having to sort and send off our boxes, some
 round the Cape, some to Melbourne, and some to go with us.’

Mrs.Inglis, on board the _Durham_ homeward bound, writes:--

 ‘Elsie has found occupation for herself in helping to nurse sick
 children, and look after turbulent boys who trouble everybody on
 board, and a baby of seven months old is an especial favourite with
 her.Eva has met with a bosom friend in a little girl named Pearly
 Macmillan, without whom she would have collapsed altogether.Our
 vessel is not a fast one, but we have been only five instead of six
 weeks getting to Suez.’

The family took a house at 70 Bruntsfield Place, and the two girls were
soon at school.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘Elsie and I used to go daily to the Charlotte Square Institution,
 which used in those days to be the Edinburgh school for girls.Father never approved of the Scotch custom
 of children walking long distances to school, and we used to be sent
 every morning in a cab.The other day, when telling the story of the
 S.W.H.’s to a large audience of working women in Edinburgh, one woman
 said to me, “My husband is a prood man the day!He tells everybody how
 he used to drive Dr.Inglis to school every morning when she was a
 girl.”’

Of her school life in Edinburgh, Miss Wright gives these memories:--

 ‘I remember quite distinctly when the girls of 23 Charlotte Square
 were told that two girls from Tasmania were coming to the school,
 and a certain feeling of surprise that the said girls were just like
 ordinary mortals, though the big, earnest brows and the quaint hair
 parted in the middle and done up in plaits fastened up at the back
 of the head were certainly not ordinary.Elsie was put in a higher
 English class than I was in, and though I knew her, I did not know her
 very well.John went to the garden.‘A friend has a story of a question going round the class, she thinks
 Clive or Warren Hastings was the subject of the lesson, and the
 question was what one would do if a calumny were spread about one.“Deny it,” one girl answered.“Live it down,” said Elsie.“Right, Miss Inglis.” My
 friend writes, “The question I cannot remember, it was the bright
 confident smile with the answer, and Mr.Hossack’s delighted wave to
 the top of the class that abides in my memory.”

 ‘I always think a very characteristic story of Elsie is her asking
 that the school might have permission to play in Charlotte Square
 gardens.In those days no one thought of providing fresh air exercise
 for girls except by walks, and tennis was just coming in.Elsie had
 the courage (to us schoolgirls it seemed the extraordinary courage)
 to confront the three directors of the school and ask if we might be
 allowed to play in the gardens of the Square.The three directors
 together were
