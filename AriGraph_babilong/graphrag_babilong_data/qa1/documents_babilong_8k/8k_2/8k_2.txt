    "Some present a saint may not despise?"Wine he brought him, such as yet
    Was ne'er on Pontiff's table set:
    Weary and faint was the holy man,
    But he crossed with a cross the tempter's can,
    And saw, ere my _first_ to his parched lip came,
    That it was red with liquid flame.Jewels he showed him--many a gem
    Fit for a Sultan's diadem:
    Dazzled, I trow, was the anchorite;
    But he told his beads with all his might;
    And instead of my _second_ so rich and rare,
    A pinch of worthless dust lay there.A lady at last he handed in,
    With a bright black eye and a fair white skin;

    But Lady Blank was already wed;
      And 'twas said
    That her lord had made a jealous shock.So he kept her in with his wonderful lock.My _second_ hung dangling by his side,
    With two little chains by which it was tied.The lady unto her lover spoke:
      (A capital joke),
    "If you can pick that terrible lock,
    Then at my chamber you may knock;
    I'll open my door in good disguise,
    And you shall behold my two little eyes."Said the nobleman of high degree:
      "Let--me--see!I know none so clever at these little jobs,
    As the Yankee mechanic, John Hobbs, John Hobbs;
    I'll send for him, and he shall undo,
    In two little minutes the door to you."At night John Hobbs he went to work,
      And with a jerk
    Turn'd back the lock, and called to my _first_,
    To see that my _second_ the ward had burst--
    When my _first_, with delight he opened the door,
    There came from within a satirical roar,

    A queer-looking pair in a queer-looking place.Why is a leaky barrel like a coward?Why are good resolutions like fainting ladies?Take away my first letter, I remain unchanged; take away my second

    He climbed the ladder, he pulled the bell;
    "I have ridden," said he, "with the saint to dine

    With water from the limpid rill;
    And "drink," quoth he, of the "juice, brave knight,
    Which breeds no fever, and prompts no fight."The hermit hastened my _second_ to spread
    With stalks of lettuce and crusts of bread;
    And "taste," quoth he, "of the cates, fair guest,
    Which bring no surfeit, and break no rest."Hasty and hungry the chief explored

as persons of little mind, easily satisfied, if I confess that we
spent the whole morning in Housel Cove without band or promenade,
without even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement
being the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of
a small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill
chance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his
sea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of
him, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he
resides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely
nothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for
those few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares
alike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one's hands and look
at the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps
to count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest
always--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that
stone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside
them, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our
feet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of
humanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,
greatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and
moat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,
have we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy
if by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will
soon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse
whom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the
leg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be
the ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the
"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the
creatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,
as it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one
another, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at
the sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of
quadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We
sat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,
and scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;
everything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,
summer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and
distant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we
had nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought
the news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its
very best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,
though small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know
nobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"
who take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable
credulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in
its pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,
but courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted
with a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish
folk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know
a single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener
at the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty
garden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of
rich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas
grew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid
as trees.In front of the open hall door
