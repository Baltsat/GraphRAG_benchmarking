‘The answer was we might play in the gardens if the neighbouring
 proprietors would give their consent, and the heroic Elsie, with I
 think one other girl, actually went round to each house in the Square
 and asked consent of the owner.‘In those days the inhabitants of Charlotte Square were very select
 and exclusive indeed, and we all felt it was a brave thing to do.Elsie gained her point, and the girls played at certain hours in the
 Square till a regular playing field was arranged.’

Her sister Eva reports that the first answer of the directors was
enough for the rest of the school.But Elsie, undaunted, interviewed
each of the three directors herself.After every bell in Charlotte
Square had been rung and all interviewed, she returned from this great
expedition triumphant.All had consented, so the damsels interned from
nine to three were given the gardens, and the grim, dull, palisaded
square must have suddenly been made to blossom like the rose.Would
that some follower of Elsie Inglis even now might ring the door bells
and get the gates unlocked to the rising generation.Elsie’s companion
or companions in this first attempt to influence those in authority
have been spoken of as ‘her first unit.’

Elsie was, for a time, joint editor of the _Edina_, a school magazine
of the ordinary type.Her great achievement was in making it pay,
which, it is recorded, no other editor was able to do.There are
various editorial anxieties alluded to in her correspondence with her
father.The memories quoted take us further than school days, but they
find a fitting place here.‘Our more intimate acquaintance came after Mrs.Inglis’ death and when
 Elsie was thinking of and beginning her medical work.In 1888 six of
 us girls who had been at the same school started the “Six Sincere
 Students Society,” which met in one house.The first year we read and
 discussed Emerson’s Essays on “Self-Reliance and Heroism.” I am pretty
 sure it was Elsie who suggested those Essays.Also, Helps, and Matthew
 Arnold’s _Culture and Anarchy_.I have a note on this “two very hot
 discussions as to what Culture means, and if it is sufficiently
 powerful to regenerate the world.Culture of the masses and also of
 women largely gone into.”

 ‘This very friendly and happy society lasted on till 1891, when it
 was enlarged and became a Debating Society.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.I find Elsie taking up
 such subjects as “That our modern civilisation is a development not a
 degeneration.” “That character is formed in a busy life rather than
 in solitude.” Papers on Henry Drummond’s _Ascent of Man_, and on the
 “Ethics of War.”

 ‘Always associated with Elsie in those days I think of her father,
 and no biography of her will be true which does not emphasise the
 beautiful and deep love and sympathy between Elsie and Mr.He
 used to meet us girls as if we were his intellectual equals, and would
 discuss problems and answer our questions with the utmost cordiality
 and appreciation of our point of view, and always there was the
 feeling of the entire understanding and fellowship between father and
 daughter.‘She was a keen croquet player, and tolerated no frivolity when a
 stroke either at croquet or golf were in the balance.She was fond of
 long walks with Mr.Inglis, and then by herself, and time never hung
 on her hands in holiday time, she was always serene and happy.’

It was decided that Elsie should go to school in Paris in September
1882--a decision not lightly made; and Mr.Inglis writes after her
departure:--

 ‘I do not think I could have borne to part with you, my darling, did
 I not feel the assurance that in doing so we are following the Lord’s
 guidance.Your dear mother and I both made it the subject of earnest
 prayer, and I feel we have been guided to do what was best for you;
 and we shall see this when the weary time is over, and we have got you
 back again with us.‘When I return to Edinburgh, I feel that I shall have no one to find
 out my Psalms for me, or to cut my _Spectator_, that we shall have
 no more discussions regarding the essays of Mr.Fraser, and no more
 anxieties about the forthcoming number of the _Edina_.The nine months
 will pass quickly.’

Elsie’s letters from Paris have not been preserved, but the ones
from her father show the alert intelligence and interest in all she
was reporting.Of the events at home and abroad, Mr.Inglis writes
to her of the Suez Canal, the bringing to justice of the Phœnix Park
murderers, the great snowstorm at home, and the Channel Tunnel.Inglis writes with maternal scepticism on some passing events: ‘I
cannot imagine you making the body of your dress.I think there would
not be many carnivals if you had to make the dresses yourselves.’
Mr.Inglis, equally sceptical, has a more satisfactory solution for
dressmaking.‘I hope you have more than one dinner frock, two or three,
and let them be pretty ones.’ Mrs.Inglis, commenting on Elsie’s
description of Gambetta’s funeral, says: ‘He is a loss to France.Poor France, she always seems to me like a vessel without a helm
driven about just where the winds take it.She has no sound Christian
principle to guide her.So different from our highly favoured England.’

Mr.Inglis’ letters are full of the courteous consideration for Elsie
and for others which marked all the way of his life, and made him
the man greatly beloved, in whatever sphere he moved._Punch_ and
the _Spectator_ went from him every week, and he writes: ‘I hope
there was nothing in that number of _Punch_ you gave M. Survelle to
study while you were finishing your breakfast to hurt his feelings
as a Frenchman._Punch_ has not been very complimentary to them of
late.’ And when Elsie’s sense of humour had been moved by a saying
of her _gouvernante_, Mr.Inglis writes, desirous of a very free
correspondence with home, but--

 ‘I fear if I send your letter to Eva, at school, that your remark
 about Miss ---- proposal to go down to the lower flat of your house,
 because the Earl of Anglesea once lived there, may be repeated and
 ultimately reach her with exaggerations, as those things always do,
 and may cause unpleasant feelings.’

There must have been some exhibition of British independence, and in
dealing with it Mr.Inglis reminds Elsie of a day in India ‘when you
went off for a walk by yourself, and we all thought you were lost, and
all the Thampanies and chaprasies and everybody were searching for you
all over the hill.’ One later episode was not on a hillside, and except
for _les demoiselles_ in Paris, equally harmless.1883._

 ‘I can quite sympathise with you, my darling, in the annoyance you
 feel at not having told Miss Brown of your having walked home part
 of the way from Madame M---- last Wednesday.It would have been far
 better if you had told her, as you wished to do, what had happened.Concealment is always wrong, and very often turns what was originally
 only a trifle into a serious matter.Mary journeyed to the office.In this case, I don’t suppose
 Miss B. could have said much if you had told her, though she may be
 seriously angry if it comes to her knowledge hereafter.If she does
 hear of it, you had better tell her that you told me all about it, and
 that I advised you, under the circumstances, as you had not told her
 at the time, and that as by doing so now you could only get the others
 into trouble, not to say anything about it; but keep clear of these
 things for the future, my darling.’

When the end came here, in this life, one of her school-fellows wrote:--

 ‘Elsie has been and is such a world-wide inspiration to all who knew
 her.One more can testify to the blessedness of her friendship.Ever
 since the Paris days of ’83 her strong loving help was ready in
 difficult times, and such wonderfully strengthening comfort in sorrow.’

The Paris education ended in the summer of 1883, and Miss Brown, who
conducted and lived with the seven girls who went out with her from
England, writes after their departure:--

 ‘I cannot tell you how much I felt when you all disappeared, and how
 sad it was to go back to look at your deserted places.I cannot at all
 realise that you are now all separated, and that we may never meet
 again on earth.May we meet often at the throne of grace, and remember
 each other there.It is nice to have a French maid to keep up the
 conversations, and if you will read French aloud, even to yourself, it
 is of use.’

Paris was, no doubt, an education in itself, but the perennial hope of
fond parents that languages and music are in the air of the continent,
were once again disappointed in Elsie.She was timber-tuned in ear and
tongue, and though she would always say her mind in any vehicle for
thought, the accent and the grammar strayed along truly British lines.Her eldest niece supplies a note on her music:--

 ‘She was still a schoolgirl when they returned from Tasmania.At that
 time she was learning music at school.I thought her a wonderful
 performer on the piano, but afterwards her musical capabilities
 became a family joke which no one enjoyed more than herself.She had
 two “pieces” which she could play by heart, of the regular arpeggio
 drawing-room style, and these always had to be performed at any family
 function as one of the standing entertainments.’

Elsie returned from Paris, the days of the schoolgirlhood left behind.Her character was formed, and she had the sense of latent powers.She
had not been long at home when her mother died of a virulent attack of
scarlet fever, and Mr.Inglis lost the lodestar of his loving nature.‘From that day Elsie shouldered all father’s burdens, and they two went
on together until his death.’

In her desk, when it was opened, these ‘Resolutions’ were found.They
are written in pencil, and belong to the date when she became the stay
and comfort of her father’s remaining years:--

 ‘I must give up dreaming,--making stories.‘I must devote my mind more to the housekeeping.‘I must be more thorough in everything.‘The bottom of the whole evil is the habit of dreaming, which must be
 given up.‘ELSIE INGLIS.’




CHAPTER IV

THE STUDENT DAYS

1885-1892

EDINBURGH--GLASGOW

    ‘Let knowledge grow from more to more,
      But more of reverence in us dwell;
      That mind and soul, according well,
    May make one music as before,
    But vaster.’


‘I remember well the day Elsie came in and, sitting down beside
father, divulged her plan of “going in for medicine.” I still see and
hear him, taking it all so perfectly calmly and naturally, and setting
to work at once to overcome the difficulties which were in the way, for
even then all was not plain sailing for the woman who desired to study
medicine.’ So writes Mrs.M‘Laren, looking back on the days when the
future doctor recognised her vocation and ministry.If it had been a
profession of ‘plain sailing,’ the adventurous spirit would probably
not have embarked in that particular vessel.The seas had only just
been charted, and not every shoal had been marked.In the midst of
them Elsie’s bark was to have its hairbreadth escapes.The University
Commission decided that women should not be excluded any longer from
receiving degrees owing to their sex.The writer recollects the
description given of the discussion by the late Sir Arthur Mitchell,
K.C.B., one of the most enlightened minds of the age in which he lived
and achieved so much.He, and one or more of his colleagues, presented
the Commissioners with the following problem: ‘Why not?On what theory
or doctrine was it just or beneficent to exclude women from University
degrees?’ There came no answer, for logic cannot be altogether
ignored by a University Commission, so, without opposition or blare
of trumpets, the Scottish Universities opened their degrees to all
students.It was of good omen that the Commission sat in high Dunedin,
under that rock bastion where Margaret, saint and queen, was the most
learned member of the Scottish nation in the age in which she reigned.Jex Blake had founded the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women,
and it was there that Elsie received her first medical teaching.Everything was still in its initial stages, and every step in the
higher education of women had to be fought and won, against the forces
of obscurantism and professional jealousy.University Commissions might issue reports, but the working out of them
was left in the hands of men who were determined to exclude women from
the medical profession.John journeyed to the garden.Clinical teaching could only be carried on in a few hospitals.Anatomy was learnt under the most discouraging circumstances.Mixed
classes were, and still are, refused.Extra-mural teaching became
complicated, on the one hand, by the extra fees which were wrung from
women students, and by the careless and perfunctory teaching accorded
by the twice-paid profession.Professors gave the off-scourings of
their minds, the least valuable of their subjects, and their unpunctual
attendance to all that stood for female students.It will hardly
be believed that the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh refused to admit
women to clinical teaching in the wards, until they had raised seven
hundred pounds to furnish two wards in which, and in which alone, they
might work.To these two wards, with their selected cases, they are
still confined, with the exception of one or two other less important
subjects.Medicals rarely belong to the moneyed classes, and very
few women can command the money demanded of the medical course, and
that women should have raised at once the tax thus put upon them by
the Royal Infirmary is an illustration of how keenly and bravely they
fought through all the disabilities laid upon them.The names of
many of them are written in gold in the story of the opening of the
profession to women.Paul had the note of
all great minds, a passion to share his knowledge of a great salvation,
with both Jews and Gentiles.That test of greatness was not conspicuous
in the majority of the medical profession at the time when Elsie Inglis
came as a learner to the gates of medical science.John went to the bedroom.That kingdom, like
most others, had to suffer violence ere she was to be known as the good
physician in her native city and in those of the allied nations.There are no letters extant from Elsie concerning her time with Dr.Inglis decided to leave their
home at Bruntsfield, and the family moved to rooms in Melville Street.Here Elsie was with her father, and carried on her studies from his
house.It was not an altogether happy start, and very soon she had
occasion to differ profoundly with Dr.Jex Blake in her management
of the school.Two of the students failed to observe the discipline
imposed by Dr.Jex Blake, and she expelled them from the school.Any high-handed act of injustice always roused Elsie to keen and
concentrated resistance.Daniel went back to the hallway.Jex Blake,
and it was successful, proving in its course that the treatment of the
students had been without justification.Looking back on this period of the difficult task of opening the
higher education to women, it is easy to see the defects of many of
those engaged in the struggle.The attitude towards women was so
intolerably unjust that many of the pioneers became embittered in soul,
and had in their bearing to friends or opponents an air which was often
provocative of misunderstanding.They did not always receive from the
younger generation for whom they had fought that forbearance that must
be always extended to ‘the old guard,’ whose scars and defects are but
the blemishes of a hardly-contested battle.Success often makes people
autocratic, and those who benefit from the success, and suffer under
the overbearing spirit engendered, forget their great gains in the
galling sensation of being ridden over rough-shod.It is an episode on
which it is now unnecessary to dwell, and Dr.Inglis would always have
been the first to render homage to the great pioneer work of Dr.Through it all Elsie was living in the presence chamber of her father’s
chivalrous, high-minded outlook.Whatever action she took then, must
have had his approval, and it was from him that she received that keen
sense of equal justice for all.These student years threw them more than ever together.On Sundays
they worshipped in the morning in Free St.George’s Church, and in the
evening in the Episcopal Cathedral.Inglis was a great walker, and
Elsie said, ‘I learnt to walk when I used to take those long walks with
father, after mother died.’ Then she would explain how you _should_
walk.‘Your whole body should go into it, and not just your feet.’

Of these student days her niece, Evelyn Simson, says:--

 ‘When she was about eighteen she began to wear a bonnet on Sunday.She
 was the last _girl_ in our connection to wear one.John travelled to the office.My Aunt Eva who is
 two years younger never did, so I think the fashion must have changed
 just then.I remember thinking how very grown up she must be.’

Another niece writes:--

 ‘At the time when it became the fashion for girls to wear their hair
 short, when she went out one day, and came home with a closely-cropped
 head, I bitterly resented the loss of Aunt Elsie’s beautiful shining
 fair hair, which had been a real glory to her face.She herself was
 most delighted with the new style, especially with the saving of
 trouble in hairdressing.‘She only allowed her hair to grow long again because she thought
 it was better for a woman doctor to dress well and as becomingly as
 possible.This opinion only grew as she became older, and had been
 longer in the profession; in her student days she rather prided
 herself on not caring about personal appearance, and she dressed very
 badly.‘Her sense of fairplay was very strong.Once in college there was an
 opposition aroused to the Student Christian Union, and a report was
 spread that the students belonging to it were neglecting their college
 work.It happened to be the time for the class examinations, and the
 lists were posted on the College notice-board.The next morning,
 the initials C.U.were found printed opposite the names of all the
 students who belonged to the Christian Union, and, as these happened
 to head the list in most instances, the unfair report was effectually
 silenced.No one knew who had initialed the list; it was some time
 afterwards I discovered it had been Aunt Elsie.She embroidered and made entirely
 herself two lovely little flannel garments for her first grand-nephew,
 in the midst of her busy life, then filled to overflowing with the
 work of her growing practice, and of her suffrage activities.‘The babies as they arrived in the families met with her special love.In her short summer holidays with any of us, the children were her
 great delight.‘She was a great believer in an open-air life.One summer she took
 three of us a short walking tour from Callander, and we did enjoy it.We tramped over the hills, and finally arrived at Crianlarich, only to
 find the hotel crammed and no sleeping accommodation.She would take
 no refusal, and persuaded the manager to let us sleep on mattresses in
 the drawing-room, which added to the adventures of our trip.‘On the way she entertained us with tales of her college life, and
 imbued us with our first enthusiasm for the women’s cause.‘When I myself began to study medicine, no one could have been more
 enthusiastically encouraging, and even through the stormy and somewhat
 depressing times of the early career of the Medical College for Women,
 Edinburgh, her faith and vision never faltered, and she helped us all
 to hold on courageously.’

In 1891 Elsie went to Glasgow to take the examination for the Triple
Qualification at the Medical School there.She could not then take
surgery in Edinburgh, and the facilities for clinical teaching were all
more favourable in Glasgow.It was probably better for her to be away from all the difficulties
connected with the opening of the second School of Medicine for Women
in Edinburgh.Jex Blake was the Edinburgh School
of Medicine for Women, and the one promoted by Elsie Inglis and other
women students was known as the Medical College for Women.‘It was with
the fortunes of this school that she was more closely associated,’
writes Dr.In Glasgow she resided at the Y.W.C.A.Her father did not
wish her to live alone in lodgings, and she accommodated herself very
willingly to the conditions under which she had to live.Miss Grant,
the superintendent, became her warm friend.Elsie’s absence from home
enabled her to give a vivid picture of her life in her daily letters to
her father.‘GLASGOW, _Feb.‘It was not nice seeing you go off and being left all alone.After I
 have finished this letter I am going to set to work.It seems there
 are twelve or fourteen girls boarding here, and there are regular
 rules.Miss Grant told me if I did not like some of them to speak to
 her, but I am not going to be such a goose as that.One rule is you
 are to make your own bed, which she did not think I could do!But I
 said I could make it beautifully.I would much rather do what all the
 others do.Well, I arranged my room, and it is as neat as a new pin.Then we walked up to the hospital, to the dispensary; we were there
 till 4.30, as there were thirty-six patients, and thirty-one of them
 new.‘I am most comfortable here, and I am going to work like _anything_.I
 told Miss Barclay so, and she said, “Oh goodness, we shall all have to
 look out for our laurels!”’

      ‘_Feb.7, ’91._

 ‘Mary Sinclair says it is no good going to the dispensaries on
 Saturday, as there are no students there, and the doctors don’t take
 the trouble to teach.MacEwan’s wards this morning.I
 was the first there, so he let me help him with an operation; then I
 went over to Dr.9._

 ‘This morning I spent the whole time in Dr.I could not think what he meant, he asked me so
 many questions.It seems it is his way of greeting a new student.Some
 of them cannot bear him, but I think he is really nice, though he can
 be abominably sarcastic, and he is a first-rate surgeon and capital
 teacher.‘To-day, it was the medical jurists and the police officers he was
 down on, and he told story after story of how they work by red tape,
 according to the text-books.He said that, while he was casualty
 surgeon, one police officer said to him that it was no good having him
 there, for he never would try to make the medical evidence fit in with
 the evidence they had collected.Once they brought in a woman stabbed
 in her wrist, and said they had caught the man who had done it running
 away, and he had a knife.MacEwan said the cut had been done by
 glass and not by a knife, so they could not convict the man, and there
 was an awful row over it.Some of them went down to the alley where
 it had happened, and sure enough there was a pane of glass smashed
 right through the centre.When the woman knew she was found out, she
 confessed she had done it herself.The moral he impressed on us was to
 examine your patient before you hear the story.is beginning to get headaches and not sleep at night.I am
 thankful to say that is not one of my tricks.Miss G. is getting
 unhappy about her, and is going to send up beef-tea every evening.She offered me some, but I like my glass of milk much better.I am
 taking my tonic and my tramp regularly, so I ought to keep well.I am
 quite disgusted when girls break down through working too hard.They
 must remember they are not as strong as men, and then they do idiotic
 things, such as taking no exercise, into the bargain.MacEwan asked us to-day to get the first stray £20,000 we could
 for him, as he wants to build a proper private hospital.So I said he
 should have the second £20,000 I came across, as I wanted the first
 to build and endow a woman’s College in Edinburgh.He said he thought
 that would be great waste; there should not be separate colleges.“If
 women are going to be doctors, equal with the men, they should go to
 the same school.” I said I quite agreed with him, but when they won’t
 admit you, what are you to do?“Leave them alone,” he said; “they will
 admit you in time,” and he thought outside colleges would only delay
 that.MacEwan’s wards a very curious case came in.Some
 of us tried to draw it, never thinking he would see us, and suddenly
 he swooped round and insisted on seeing every one of the scribbles.He has eyes, I believe, in the back of his head and ears everywhere.He forgot, I thought, to have the ligature taken off a leg he was
 operating on, and I said so in the lowest whisper to M. S. About five
 minutes afterwards, he calmly looked straight over to us, and said,
 “_Now_, we’ll take off the ligature!”

 ‘I went round this morning and saw a few of my patients.I found one
 woman up who ought to have been in bed.I discovered she had been up
 all night because her husband came in tipsy about eleven o’clock.I think he ought to have been
 horse-whipped, and when I have the vote I shall vote that all men who
 turn their wives and families out of doors at eleven o’clock at night,
 especially when the wife is ill, shall be horse-whipped.And, if they
 make the excuse that they were tipsy, I should give them double.They
 would very soon learn to behave themselves.‘As to the father of the cherubs you ask about, his family does not
 seem to lie very heavily on his mind.He is not in work just now, and
 apparently is very often out of work.One cannot take things seriously
 in that house.‘In the house over the Clyde I saw the funniest sight.Daniel travelled to the office.It is an Irish
 house, as dirty as a pig-sty, and there are about ten children.When
 I got there, at least six of the children were in the room, and half
 of them without a particle of clothing.They were sitting about on the
 table and on the floor like little cherubs with black faces.I burst
 out laughing when I saw them, and they all joined in most heartily,
 including the mother, though not one of them saw the joke, for they
 came and stood just as they were round me in a ring to see the baby
 washed.Suddenly, the cherubs began to disappear and ragged children
 to appear instead.I looked round to see who was dressing them, but
 there was no one there.They just slipped on their little black
 frocks, without a thing on underneath, and departed to the street as
 soon as the baby was washed.‘Three women with broken legs have come in.I don’t believe so many
 women have ever broken their legs together in one day before!One of
 them is a shirt finisher.She sews on the buttons and puts in the
 gores at the rate of 4½d.We know the shop, and they
 _sell_ the shirts at 4s.Of course, political economy is
 quite true, but I hope that shopkeeper, if ever he comes back to this
 earth, will be a woman and have to finish shirts at 4½d.a dozen, and
 then he’ll see the other side of the question.I told the woman it was
 her own fault for taking such small wages, at which she seemed amused.It is funny the stimulating effect a big school has on a hospital.The
 Royal here is nearly as big and quite as rich as the Edinburgh Royal,
 but there is no pretence that they really are in their teaching and
 arrangements the third hospital in the kingdom, as they are in size._The_ London Hospital is the biggest, and then comes Edinburgh, and
 this is the third.Guy’s and Bart.’s, that one hears so much about,
 are quite small in comparison, but they have big medical schools
 attached.The doctors seem to lie on their oars if they don’t have to
 teach.1892._

 ‘I thought the Emperor of Germany’s speech the most impertinent piece
 of self-glorification I ever met with.Steed’s egotism is perfect
 humility beside it.He and his house are the chosen instruments of
 “our supreme Lord,” and anybody who does not approve of what he does
 had better clear out of Germany.As you say, Makomet and Luther and
 all the great epoch-makers had a great belief in themselves and their
 mission, but the German Emperor will have to give some further proof
 of his divine commission (beyond a supreme belief in himself) before
 I, for one, will give in my submission.I
 think it was perfectly blasphemous.‘The _Herald_ has an article about wild women.Andrews has opened the flood-gates, and now there is the deluge.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Andrews has done very well--degrees and mixed classes from next
 October.Don’t you think our Court might send a memorial to the
 University Court about medical degrees?It is splendid having Sir
 William Muir on our side, and I believe the bulk of the Senators are
 all right--they only want a little shove.’

In Glasgow the women students had to encounter the opposition to ‘mixed
classes,’ and the fight centred in the Infirmary.It would have been
more honest to have promulgated the decision of the Managers before
the women students had paid their fees for the full course of medical
tuition.Elsie, in her letters, describes the toughly fought contest, and the
final victory won by the help of the just and enlightened leaders in
the medical world.‘So here is another fight,’ writes the student, with
a sigh of only a half regret!It was too good a fight, and the backers
were too strong for the women students not to win their undoubted
rights.Through all the chaffing and laughter, one perceives the thread
of a resolute purpose, and Elsie’s great gift, the unconquerable facing
of ‘the Hill Difficulty.’ True, the baffled and puzzled enemy often
played into their hands, as when Dr.T., driven to extremity in a weak
moment, threatened to prevent their attendance by ‘physical force.’
The threat armed the students with yet another legal grievance.Elsie
describes on one occasion in her haste going into a ward where Dr.Gemmel, one of the ‘mixed’ objectors, was demonstrating.She perceived
her mistake, and retreated, not before receiving a smile from her
enemy.The now Sir William MacEwan enjoyed the fight quite as much as
his women students; and if to-day he notes the achievements of the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals, he may count as his own some of their
success in the profession in which he has achieved so worthy a name.The dispute went on until at length an exhausted foe laid down its
weapons, and the redoubtable Dr.T. conveyed the intimation that the
women students might go to any of the classes--and a benison on them!The faction fight, like many another in the brave days of old,
roared and clattered down the paved causeways of Glasgow.T., in
his gate-house, must have wished his petticoat foes many times away
and above the pass.If he, or any of the obstructionists of that day
survive, we know that they belong to a sect that needs no repentance.They may, however, note with self-complacency that their action trained
on a generation skilled in the contest of fighting for democratic
rights in the realm of knowledge.It is a birthright to enter into that
gateway, and the keys are given to all who possess the understanding
mind and reverent attitude towards all truth.1891._

 ‘Those old wretches, the Infirmary Managers, have reared their heads
 again, and now have decided that we are not to go to mixed classes,
 and we have been tearing all over the wards seeing all sorts of people
 about it.K
