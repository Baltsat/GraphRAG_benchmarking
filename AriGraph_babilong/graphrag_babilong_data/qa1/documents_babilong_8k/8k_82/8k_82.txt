Macloud observed--"and on his uppers!""He is down hard, a little money
with a small divide, if successful, will get him.Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak or to go on.Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.Mighty kind in one who lost so much
through us.""You were not to blame--Royster's responsible, and he's gone----"

"To hell!""Meanwhile, can I do anything for
you?You're having a run of hard luck, aren't you?"For a moment, Axtell did not answer--he was gulping down his thoughts."I've just ten dollars to my name.I came here
thinking the Congressmen, who made piles through our office, would get
me something, but they gave me the marble stare.I was good enough to
tip them off and do favors for them, but they're not remembering me
now.Do you know where I can get a job?""Yes--I'll give you fifty dollars and board, if you will come with us
for two weeks."Will I take it?--Well, rather!""What you're to do, with Mr.Macloud and myself, we will disclose
later.If, then, you don't care to aid us, we must ask you to keep
silence about it.""I'll do my part, and ask
no questions--and thank you for trusting me.You're the first man since
our failure, who hasn't hit me in the face--don't you think I
appreciate it?"nodding toward
a small bag, which Axtell had in his hand."Then, come along--we're bound for Annapolis, and the car leaves in ten
minutes."X

PIRATE'S GOLD BREEDS PIRATE'S WAYS


That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment at Carvel Hall, they
took Axtell into their confidence--to a certain extent (though, again,
he protested his willingness simply to obey orders).They told him, in
a general way, of Parmenter's bequest, and how Croyden came to be the
legatee--saying nothing of its great value, however--its location, the
loss of the letter the previous evening, the episode of the thieves on
the Point, that morning, and their evident intention to return to the
quest."Now, what we want to know is: are you ready to help us--unaided by the
law--to seize these men and hold them prisoners, while we search for
the treasure?""We may be killed in the attempt, or we
may kill one or both of them, and have to stand trial if detected.If
you don't want to take the risk, you have only to decline--and hold
your tongue."said Axtell, "I don't want you to pay me a
cent--just give me my board and lodging and I'll gladly aid you as long
as necessary.It's a very little thing to do for one who has lost so
much through us.You provide for our defense, if we're apprehended by
the law, and _that_" (snapping his fingers) "for the risk.""We'll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you please," he said; "and, if
we recover what Parmenter buried, you'll not regret it."The following morning saw them down at the Point with the equipage and
other paraphernalia.The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis for
the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees, ditched them, received
their pay, climbed into the wagons and rumbled away to town--puzzled
that anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point when they had the
price of a hotel, and three square meals a day."It looks pretty good," said Croyden, when the canvases were up and
everything arranged--"and we shan't lack for the beautiful in nature.This is about the prettiest spot I've ever seen, the Chesapeake and the
broad river--the old town and the Academy buildings--the warships at
anchor--the _tout ensemble!_ We may not find the treasure, but, at
least, we've got a fine camp--though, I reckon, it is a bit breezy when
the wind is from the Bay.""I wonder if we should have paid our respects to the Superintendent
before poaching on his preserves?""Hum--hadn't thought of that!""Better go in and show
ourselves to him, this afternoon.He seems to be something of a
personage down here, and we don't want to offend him.These naval
officers, I'm told, are sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due
their rank.""On that score, we've got some rank
ourselves to uphold."the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, of the
United States Senate, is with us.According to the regulations, is it
his duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.""However, the Superintendent has a copy
of the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if
he's quiescent, it's up to us.""You should have been a diplomat,
Croyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!""A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to
Annapolis," he said."Look at the one cutting through the water there,
midway across!"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer
in uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put
about and went chugging upstream."We didn't seem to please him," remarked Macloud, gazing after the
boat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the
Experiment Station."We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet
either way," said Macloud."Otherwise, they wouldn't have
despatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As
soon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a
few steps forward to meet him."Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am
one of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr."The
Superintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself
and the Academy at your disposal."(He was instructed to add, that
Captain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to
Washington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we
appreciate his kindness exceedingly," Macloud answered."We're camping
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed."So far, we're making delightful progress," said Croyden; "but there
are breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our
absence."They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the
tools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit
to the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was
disclosed."Not very likely," replied Macloud, "with half a million at stake.They
probably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them
back again.""Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?""They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one
else.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is
like the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.""If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would
help some!""Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins
of the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel
last night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry
Point in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals
toward the ruins."What do you make the distance from the land?""About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over
water.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.""It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the
near side of the ruins," said Croyden."Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!""I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your
breakfast," answered Croyden."Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.""Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It
gives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain
figures.""Now, what's the rest
of the figures--or haven't you worked it out?""The calculation is of value only on the
assumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the
light-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now
three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing
ninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and
twenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three
and a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred
and ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and
a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the
Point, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.""Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet
Parmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore
line, instead of seven hundred and fifty!""As the Point from year to year slipped
into the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,
gradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since
Parmenter's beeches went down.""Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and
made a note of it on the letter?""Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,
likely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point
seemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large
trees to landward.""Next let us measure back eighty-five feet," said Croyden, producing a
tape-line.... "There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But
where were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them
intersect?"...said Macloud--"where were the trees, and where
did the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got
it?"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over."I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they
disclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,
it matters little where the others were, in determining the direction
of the treasure.The _objective point_ will
change as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_
will vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who
understand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we
are correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----"

He opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran
his eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he
glanced at Macloud and smiled."The treasure is buried," he repeated--"the treasure is buried--_out in
the Bay_.""Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult," he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low
bluff at the water's edge."Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here," he said, "and Parmenter
buried the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.""Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not
only encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.""It's hard to dig in water," Macloud remarked."It's apt to fill in the
hole, you know.""Don't be sarcastic," Croyden retorted."I'm not responsible for the
Bay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.""Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're
based," Macloud replied."And as the former seem to be accurate, and
the latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.""At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or
close on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the
entire Point.""You have given us a mighty plausible start," said Macloud.as a
buggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents."It is Hook-nose back again," said Macloud."Come to pay a social call,
I suppose!"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.""Come to treat with us--to share the treasure."By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,
immediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered
along landward."And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know
them," added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the
occupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the
horse over in front of them."Which of you men is named Croyden?""Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your
handle, isn't it?""You have the advantage of me," Croyden assured him."Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a
little private talk?"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and
continuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following."If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to
accommodate you," said the fellow."I thought, however, you'd rather
keep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,
all right, my friend!""Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,"
said Croyden."When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and
give them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,
with one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only
with small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before
they can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the
plea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with
impunity.""This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!""I would that I
were in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for
the war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can
just as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,
myself.""I can't," said Macloud."But there seem to be no rules to the game
we're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity."As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head
and got out."Leave it to me, I'll get them together," Croyden answered.... "You
wish to see me, privately?""I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not."said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was
pitched a trifle to one side.... "Now, sir, what is it?"as the flaps
dropped behind them."You've a business way about you, which I like----" began Hook-nose."Come to the point--what do
you want?""There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!"You lost a letter recently----"

"Not at all," Croyden cut in."I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,
are the thief.""I, or my pal--it matters not which," the fellow replied easily."Now,
what we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you've found it.""Well, let me tell you there won't
be any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I
don't agree with one."Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish."Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, "hitch the horse and come in."And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally
retired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their
backs to the entrance."I'm glad to make your acquaint----" began Smith."There is no need for an introduction," Croyden interrupted curtly."You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down
to business, if you please!""You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're
hell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that
this treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the
Government's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong
box--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own
flippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,
when the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.""Rather a good bargain for you," said Croyden."We supply the
information, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,
pray?""For our silence, and an equal share in the information.John journeyed to the bedroom.You have
doubtless forgot that we have the letter now."Daniel moved to the kitchen."Better
half a big loaf than no loaf at all.""I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know
it.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's
money belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States
land.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,
and the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!""If you're one to throw away good money, I miss
my guess.""I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill
might as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you
uncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget
that we come in for a share."His ears were
primed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--"Let us
have them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.""You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's
covered his pal.--Croyden cried--"None of that,
Hook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your
brains like chickenfeed."His own big revolver was sticking out of
Macloud's pocket."Now, I'll look after you, while my
friends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a
bullet down his throat.""Hands behind your back, Bald-head," commanded Axtell, briskly.Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on."Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!"Now, I'll do for you," Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.“Your own mamma, little woman,” he repeats gently.of course you don’t remember her.You remind me of her, Ruby, in a
great many ways, and it is my greatest wish that you grow up just such
a woman as your dear mother was.I
don’t think you ever asked me about your mother before.”

“I just wondered,” says Ruby.She is gazing up into the cloudless blue
of the sky, which has figured so vividly in her dream of last night.“I
wish I remembered her,” Ruby murmurs, with the tiniest sigh.“Poor little lassie!” says the father, patting the small hand.“Her
greatest sorrow was in leaving you, Ruby.You were just a baby when she
died.Not long before she went away she spoke about you, her little
girl whom she was so unwilling to leave.‘Tell my little Ruby,’ she
said, ‘that I shall be waiting for her.I have prayed to the dear Lord
Jesus that she may be one of those whom He gathers that day when He
comes to make up His jewels.’ She used to call you her little jewel,
Ruby.”

“And my name means a jewel,” says Ruby, looking up into her father’s
face with big, wondering brown eyes.The dream mother has come nearer
to her little girl during those last few minutes than she has ever
done before.Those words, spoken so long ago, have made Ruby feel her
long-dead young mother to be a real personality, albeit separated from
the little girl for whom one far day she had prayed that Christ might
number her among His jewels.In that fair city, “into which no foe can
enter, and from which no friend can ever pass away,” Ruby’s mother has
done with all care and sorrow.God Himself has wiped away all tears
from her eyes for ever.Ruby goes about with a very sober little face that morning.She gathers
fresh flowers for the sitting-room, and carries the flower-glasses
across the courtyard to the kitchen to wash them out.This is one of
Ruby’s customary little duties.She has a variety of such small tasks
which fill up the early hours of the morning.After this Ruby usually
conscientiously learns a few lessons, which her step-mother hears her
recite now and then, as the humour seizes her.But at present Ruby is enjoying holidays in honour of Christmas,
holidays which the little girl has decided shall last a month or more,
if she can possibly manage it.“You’re very quiet to-day, Ruby,” observes her step-mother, as the
child goes about the room, placing the vases of flowers in their
accustomed places.Thorne is reclining upon her favourite sofa,
the latest new book which the station affords in her hand.Mary journeyed to the garden.“Aren’t you
well, child?” she asks.“Am I quiet?” Ruby says.“I didn’t notice, mamma.Daniel went back to the hallway.I’m all right.”

It is true, as the little girl has said, that she has not even noticed
that she is more quiet than usual.Involuntarily her thoughts have
gone out to the mother whom she never knew, the mother who even now is
waiting in sunny Paradise for the little daughter she has left behind.Since she left her so long ago, Ruby has hardly given a thought to her
mother.The snow is lying thick on her grave in the little Scottish
kirkyard at home; but Ruby has been happy enough without her, living
her own glad young life without fear of death, and with no thought to
spare for the heaven beyond.But now the radiant vision of last night’s dream, combined with her
father’s words, have set the child thinking.Will the Lord Jesus indeed
answer her mother’s prayer, and one day gather little Ruby among His
jewels?Will he care very much that this little jewel of His has never
tried very hard throughout her short life to work His will or do His
bidding?What if, when the Lord Jesus comes, He finds Ruby all unworthy
to be numbered amongst those jewels of His?And the long-lost mother,
who even in heaven will be the gladder that her little daughter is with
her there, how will she bear to know that the prayer she prayed so long
ago is all in vain?“And if he doesn’t gather me,” Ruby murmurs, staring straight up into
the clear, blue sky, “what shall I do?Oh, what shall I do?”

CHAPTER V.

THE BUSH FIRE.“Will you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ’s sake
    to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?”

    “I will so shew myself, by God’s help.”

                     _Consecration of Bishops, Book of Common Prayer._


Jack’s card is placed upright on the mantel-piece of Ruby’s bedroom,
its back leaning against the wall, and before it stands a little girl
with a troubled face, and a perplexed wrinkle between her brows.“It says it there,” Ruby murmurs, the perplexed wrinkle deepening.“And
that text’s out of the Bible.But when there’s nobody to be kind to, I
can’t do anything.”

The sun is glinting on the frosted snow scene; but Ruby is not looking
at the snow scene.Her eyes are following the old, old words of the
first Christmas carol: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men!”

“If there was only anybody to be kind to,” the little girl repeats
slowly.“Dad and mamma don’t need me to be kind to them, and I _am_
quite kind to Hans and Dick.If it was only in Scotland now; but it’s
quite different here.”

The soft summer wind is swaying the window-blinds gently to and fro,
and ruffling with its soft breath the thirsty, parched grass about the
station.To the child’s mind has come a remembrance, a remembrance of
what was “only a dream,” and she sees an old, old man, bowed down with
the weight of years, coming to her across the moonlit paths of last
night, an old man whom Ruby had let lie where he fell, because he was
only “the wicked old one.”

“It was only a dream, so it didn’t matter.” Thus the little girl tries
to soothe a suddenly awakened conscience.“And he _is_ a wicked old
one; Dick said he was.”

Ruby goes over to the window, and stands looking out.There is no
change in the fair Australian scene; on just such a picture Ruby’s eyes
have rested since first she came.But there is a strange, unexplained
change in the little girl’s heart.Only that the dear Lord Jesus has
come to Ruby, asking her for His dear sake to be kind to one of the
lowest and humblest of His creatures.“If it was only anybody else,”
she mutters.“But he’s so horrid, and he has such a horrid face.And I
don’t see what I could do to be kind to such a nasty old man as he is.Besides, perhaps dad wouldn’t like me.”

“Good will toward men!Good will toward men!” Again the heavenly
voices seem ringing in Ruby’s ears.There is no angel host about her
to strengthen and encourage her, only one very lonely little girl who
finds it hard to do right when the doing of that right does not quite
fit in with her own inclinations.She has taken the first step upon the
heavenly way, and finds already the shadow of the cross.The radiance of the sunshine is reflected in Ruby’s brown eyes, the
radiance, it may be, of something far greater in her heart.“I’ll do it!” the little girl decides suddenly.Sandra went back to the kitchen.“I’ll try to be kind to
the ‘old one.’ Only what can I do?”

“Miss Ruby!” cries an excited voice at the window, and, looking out,
Ruby sees Dick’s brown face and merry eyes.“Come ’long as quick as
you can.There’s a fire, and you said t’other day you’d never seen one.I’ll get Smuttie if you come as quick as you can.It’s over by old
Davis’s place.”

Dick’s young mistress does not need a second bidding.She is out
waiting by the garden-gate long before Smuttie is caught and harnessed.Away to the west she can see the long glare of fire shooting up tongues
of flame into the still sunlight, and brightening the river into a very
sea of blood.“I don’t think you should go, Ruby,” says her mother, who has come
out on the verandah.“It isn’t safe, and you are so venturesome.I am
dreadfully anxious about your father too.Dick says he and the men are
off to help putting out the fire; but in such weather as this I don’t
see how they can ever possibly get it extinguished.”

“I’ll be very, very careful, mamma,” Ruby promises.Her brown eyes
are ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.“And I’ll be there
to watch dad too, you know,” she adds persuasively in a voice which
expresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he
and his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be
got to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The
first spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the
excessive heat of the sun’s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,
and where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been
laid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the
case, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.“Look at it!” Dick cries excitedly.“Goin’ like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn’t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He’ll maybe be frightened at
the fire.John travelled to the garden.they’ve got the start of it.Do you see that other fire
on ahead?That’s where they’re burning down!”

Ruby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as
Dick has said, “like steam-engines.”

“My!” the boy cries suddenly; “it’s the old wicked one’s house.It’s it
that has got afire.There’s not enough
of them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it’ll be on to your
pa’s land if they don’t stop it pretty soon.I’ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby.You’ll have to get off Smuttie and hold
him in case he gets scared at the fire.”

“Oh, Dick!” the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes
are fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.“Do you think
he’ll be dead?Do you think the old man’ll be dead?”

“Not him,” Dick returns, with a grin.“He’s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!” the boy ejaculates.“It would be a good
riddance of bad rubbish, that’s what it would.”

“Oh, Dick,” shivers Ruby, “I wish you wouldn’t say that.I’ve never been kind!” Ruby
breaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is
hard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the
Australian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are
two detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish
the flames of poor old Davis’s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down
the
