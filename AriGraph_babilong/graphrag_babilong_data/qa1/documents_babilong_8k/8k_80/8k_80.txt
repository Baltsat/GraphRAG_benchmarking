I formed this opinion when I heard of
the circumstances which are supposed to have led to the assassination of
Major Neill.If true, we have here secret incitement to murder handed
down for generations, and our Government, with its extensive police and
its Thuggee Department, knowing nothing about it![56]

stating that, so far as it is possible at this date to corroborate
incidents that occurred thirty-five years ago, Mr.Forbes-Mitchell has
afforded us ample proof of the accuracy of his memory and the general
correctness of his facts.In the case under notice, we have been shown
the leaflet in which Mazar Ali's cold-blooded murder of his commanding
officer is vindicated, and of which the English translation above given
is an exact reproduction.The leaflet bears no evidence whatever to
disclose its origin, but we see no reason to doubt that, as Mr.Forbes-Mitchell's informant declared, it was widely circulated in the
bazaars of Upper India shortly after Mazar Ali paid the penalty of his
crime with his own life."--ED._Calcutta Statesman._

EUROPEANS AMONG THE REBELS


Although recollections of the Mutiny are fast being obliterated by the
kindly hand of time, there must still be many readers who will remember
the reports current in the newspapers of the time, and elsewhere in 1857
and 1858, of Europeans being seen in the ranks of the rebels.In a
history of _The Siege of Delhi, by an Officer who served there_ (name
not given), published by Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1861, the
following passages occur.After describing the battle of
Budlee-ke-Serai, the writer goes on to say: "The brave old Afghan chief,
Jan Fishan Khan,[57] who with some horsemen had followed our star from
Meerut, was heard crying out, his stout heart big with the enthusiasm of
the moment: 'Another such day, and I shall become a Christian!'"And in
his comments on this the writer says: "And sad to tell, a European
deserter from Meerut had been struck down fighting in the sepoy ranks,
and was recognised by his former comrades."After describing the opening
of the siege and the general contempt which the Europeans had for the
enemy's artillery, the writer states that the tone of conversation in
the camp was soon changed, and "From being an object of contempt, their
skill became one of wonder and admiration, perhaps too great.Some
artillery officers protested that their practice was better than our
own.Many believed that their fire was under the superintendence of
Europeans.Two men with solar helmets could be seen, by the help of our
best glasses, in their batteries, but no one who knew how much of the
work in India was really done by natives, wondered at the practical
skill they now showed."Turning from Delhi to Lucknow, many will
remember the account of the disastrous action at Chinhut by Mr.He
says: "The masses of the rebel cavalry by which the British were
outflanked near the Kookrail bridge, were apparently commanded by some
European who was seen waving his sword and attempting to make his men
follow him and dash at ours.He was a handsome-looking man, well-built,
fair, about twenty-five years of age, with light moustaches, wearing the
undress uniform of a European cavalry officer, with a blue, gold-laced
cap on his head."Rees suggests the possibility of this person
having been either a Russian or a renegade Christian.The only other case to which I will allude came under my own
observation.I have told in my fourteenth chapter how Brigadier Adrian
Hope was killed in the abortive attack on the fort of Rooyah, by a shot
fired from a high tree inside the fort, and how it was commonly believed
that the man who fired the shot was a European.I myself thought at the
time that such was the case, and now I am convinced of it.John moved to the bedroom.I was the
non-commissioned officer of a party of the Ninety-Third sent to cover an
engineer-officer who had either volunteered or been ordered to take a
sketch of one of the fort gates and its approaches, in the hope of being
able to blow it in, and thus gain an entrance to the fort, which was
surrounded by a deep ditch, and inside the ditch an almost impenetrable
belt of prickly bamboos about ten yards in breadth, so interwoven and
full of thorns that a cat could scarcely have passed through it.Under
the guidance of a native of the Intelligence Department, we managed to
advance unseen, and got under cover of a thick clump of bamboos near the
gate.Strict orders had been given that no one on any account whatever
was to speak, much less to fire a shot, unless we should be attacked,
for fear of drawing attention to our proceedings, till the engineer had
had time to make a rough sketch of the position of the gate and its
approaches.During this time we were so close to the fort that we could
hear the enemy talking inside; and the man who was on the tree could be
seen and heard by us quite plainly, calling to the stormers on the other
face in unmistakable barrack-room English: "Come on, you ----
Highlanders!you have a harder nut to crack than eating
oatmeal porridge.If you can come through these bamboos we'll warm your
---- for you, if you come in here!"In short, the person
talking showed such a command of English slang and barrack-room abuse
that it was clear he was no native.Every one of my party was convinced
that the speaker was a European, and if we had been aware at the time
that this man had just killed Brigadier Hope he would certainly have
paid the penalty with his own life; but we knew nothing of this till we
retired, and found that the stormers had been recalled, with the
butcher's bill already given.The events above related had almost passed from my recollection, till
they were recalled by the following circumstance.A vacancy having
occurred among the _durwans_[58] in the factory under my charge, among
several candidates brought by the _jemadar_[59] for the vacant post was
a fine-looking old man, who gave me an unmistakable military salute in
the old style, square from the shoulder--quite different from the
present mongrel German salute, which the English army has taken to
imitating since the Germans beat their old conquerors, the French; I
mean the present mode of saluting with the palm of the hand turned to
the front.As soon as I saw this old man I knew he had been a soldier;
my heart warmed to him at once, and I determined to give him the vacant
appointment.So turning to him I said: "You have served in the army; are
you one of the sepoys of 1857?"He at once admitted that he had formerly
belonged to the Ninth Native Infantry, and that he was present with the
regiment when it mutinied at Allyghur on the 20th of May, 1857.He had
accompanied the regiment to Delhi, and had fought against the English
throughout the siege, and afterwards at Lucknow and throughout the Oude
campaigns."But, _Sahib_" said he, "the Ninth Regiment were almost the
only regiment which did not murder their officers.We gave each of them
three months' pay in advance from the treasury, and escorted them and
their families within a safe distance of Agra before we went to Delhi,
and all of us who lived to come through the Mutiny were pardoned by the
Government."I knew this to be the truth, and ordered the _jemadar_ to
enrol the applicant, by name Doorga, or Doorga Sing, late sepoy of the
Ninth Native Infantry, as one of the factory _durwans_, determining to
have many a talk with him on his experiences of the Mutiny.Many of my readers may recollect that, after escorting their European
officers to the vicinity of Agra, the Ninth Regiment went to Delhi, and
throughout the siege the men of this regiment proved the most daring
opponents of the British Army.According to Mead's _Sepoy Revolt_, "The
dead bodies of men bearing the regimental number of the Ninth Regiment
were found in the front line of every severe engagement around Delhi and
at the deadly Cashmere Gate when it was finally stormed."After engaging
Doorga Sing it was not long before I made him relate his experiences of
the siege of Delhi, and afterwards at Lucknow and in Oude, and one day I
happened to ask him if it was true that there were several Europeans in
the rebel army.He told me that he had heard of several, but that he
personally knew of two only, one of whom accompanied the mutineers from
Meerut and was killed at the battle of Budlee-ke-Serai,--evidently the
deserter alluded to above.The other European was a man of superior
stamp, who came to Delhi from Rohilcund with the Bareilly Brigade, and
the King gave him rank in the rebel army next to General Bukht Khan, the
titular Commander-in-Chief, This European commanded the artillery
throughout the siege of Delhi, as he had formerly been in the Company's
artillery and knew the drill better than any man in the rebel army.I
asked Doorga Sing if he had ever heard his name or what rank he held
before the Mutiny, and he said he had heard his name at the time, but
had forgotten it, and that before the Mutiny he had held the rank of
sergeant-major, but whether in the native artillery or in one of the
native infantry regiments at Bareilly he did not now recollect.But the
Badshah promoted him to be general of artillery immediately on the
arrival of the Bareilly Brigade, and he was by far the bravest and most
energetic commander that the rebels had, and the most esteemed by the
revolted sepoys, whose respect he retained to the last.Even after they
had ceased saluting their native officers they continued to turn out
guards and present arms to the European _sahib_.Throughout the siege of
Delhi there was never a day passed that this man did not visit every
battery, and personally correct the elevation of the guns.He fixed the
sites and superintended the erection of all new batteries to counteract
the fire of the English as the siege advanced.On the day of the
assault, the 14th of September, he fought like _shaitan_,[60] fighting
himself and riding from post to post, trying to rally defeated sepoys,
and bringing up fresh troops to the support of assailed points.Doorga
Sing's company had formed the guard at the Cashmere Gate, and he vividly
described the attack and defence of that post, and how completely the
sepoys were surprised and the powder-bags fixed to the gate before the
sentries of the guard were aware of the advance of the English.After the assault Doorga Sing did not see the European till the beaten
army reached Muttra, when he again found him superintending the
arrangements for crossing the Jumna.About thirty thousand sepoys had
collected there in their retreat from Delhi, a common danger holding
them together, under the command of Bukht Khan and Feroze Shah.But they
paid more respect to the European, and obeyed his orders with far more
alacrity than they did those of Bukht Khan or any other of their nominal
leaders.After crossing the Jumna the European remained with the rebels
till they reached a safe retreat on the Oude side of the Ganges, when he
left the force in company with the Raja of Surajpore, a petty state on
the Oude side about twenty or twenty-five miles above Cawnpore.About
this time my informant, Doorga Sing, having been wounded at Delhi, left
the rebel army _en route_ to Lucknow, and returned to his village near
Onao in Oude; but hearing of the advance of the English, and expecting
no mercy, he and several others repaired to Lucknow, and rejoined their
old comrades.He did not again see the European till after the fall of Lucknow, when
he met him at Fort Rooyah, where he commanded the sepoys, and was the
principal adviser of the Raja Nirput Singh, whom he prevented from
accepting the terms offered by the English through General Walpole.I am
fully convinced that this was the man whom we saw in the tree, and who
was reported to have killed Brigadier Hope.John travelled to the bathroom.After their retreat from Rooyah the sepoys, under this European,
remained in the jungles till the English army had passed on to Bareilly,
when they reattacked Shahjehanpore, and would have retaken it, if a
brigade had not arrived from Bareilly to its relief.After being driven
back from Shahjehanpore the sepoys held together in Mahomdee, Sitapore,
and elsewhere, throughout the hot season of 1858, mostly under the
guidance of the European and Bukht Khan.said Macloud, with an amused smile."In fact, you're alone in the
woods."But the views are not irrevocable--I may change, you know.In the meantime, let us go down to Fleet Street and interview Casey.And then, if you're good, I'll take you to call on Miss Carrington.""Come along, man, come
along!"VII

GREENBERRY POINT


There was no trouble with Casey--he had been mighty glad to take them.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.And, at about noon of the following day, they drew in to the ancient
capital, having made a quick and easy run from Hampton.It was clear, bright October weather, when late summer seems to linger
for very joy of staying, and all nature is in accord.The State House,
where Washington resigned his commission--with its chaste lines and
dignified white dome, when viewed from the Bay (where the monstrosity
of recent years that has been hung on behind, is not visible) stood out
clearly in the sunlight, standing high above the town, which slumbers,
in dignified ease, within its shadow.A few old mansions, up the Spa,
seen before they landed, with the promise of others concealed among the
trees, higher up, told their story of a Past departed--a finished
city."Yonder, sir, on the far side of the Severn--the strip of land which
juts out into the Bay.""First hypothesis, dead as a musket!""There isn't
a house in sight--except the light-house, and it's a bug-light.""No houses--but where are the trees?""It seems
pretty low," he said, to the skipper; "is it ever covered with water?""I think not, sir--the water's just eating it slowly away."Croyden nodded, and faced townward."What is the enormous white stone building, yonder?""The Naval Academy--that's only one of the buildings, sir, Bancroft
Hall.The whole Academy occupies a great stretch of land along the
Severn."They landed at the dock, at the foot of Market Place and inquired the
way to Carvel Hall--that being the hotel advised by Dick.They were
directed up Wayman's alley--one of the numerous three foot
thoroughfares between streets, in which the town abounds--to Prince
George Street, and turning northward on it for a block, past the once
splendid Brice house, now going slowly to decay, they arrived at the
hotel:--the central house of English brick with the wings on either
side, and a modern hotel building tacked on the rear.was Macloud's comment, as they ascended the steps
to the brick terrace and, thence, into the hotel."Isn't this an old
residence?"he inquired of the clerk, behind the desk.It's the William Paca (the Signer) mansion, but it served as
the home of Dorothy Manners in _Richard Carvel_, and hence the name,
sir: Carvel Hall.We've many fine houses here: the Chase House--he
also was a Signer; the Harwood House, said to be one of the most
perfect specimens of Colonial architecture in America; the Scott House,
on the Spa; the Brice House, next door; McDowell Hall, older than any
of them, was gutted by fire last year, but has been restored; the Ogle
mansion--he was Governor in the 1740's, I think.this was the Paris
of America before and during the Revolution.Why, sir, the tonnage of
the Port of Annapolis, in 1770, was greater than the tonnage of the
Port of Baltimore, to-day."What's
happened to it since 1770?""Nothing, sir--that's the trouble, it's progressed backward--and
Baltimore has taken its place.""It's being served now, sir--twelve-thirty to two.""Order a pair of saddle horses, and have them around at one-thirty,
please.""There is no livery connected with the hotel, sir, but I'll do what I
can.There isn't any saddlers for hire, but we will get you a pair of
'Cheney's Best,' sir--they're sometimes ridden.However, you had
better drive, if you will permit me to suggest, sir.""No!--we will try the horses," he said.It had been determined that they should ride for the reasons, as urged
by Macloud, that they could go on horseback where they could not in a
conveyance, and they would be less likely to occasion comment.The
former of which appealed to Croyden, though the latter did not.Macloud had borrowed an extra pair of riding breeches and puttees, from
his friend, and, at the time appointed, the two men passed through the
office.Two <DW64> lads were holding a pair of rawboned nags, that resembled
saddlers about as much as a cigar-store Indian does a sonata.Croyden
looked them over in undisguised disgust."If these are Cheney's Best," he commented, "what in Heaven's name are
his worst?"said Macloud, adjusting the stirrups."Get aboard and leave
the kicking to the horses, they may be better than they look."Straight up to the College green," he replied, pointing; "then one
square to the right to King George Street, and on out it, across
College Creek, to the Marine Barracks.The road forks there; you turn
to the right; and the bridge is at the foot of the hill.""He ought to write a guide book," said Croyden."Well paved
streets,--but a trifle hard for riding.""And more than a trifle dirty," Croyden added."My horse isn't so
bad--how's yours?""He'll do!--This must be the Naval Academy," as they passed along a
high brick wall--"Yonder, are the Barracks--the Marines are drilling in
front."They clattered over the creek, rounded the quarters of the
"Hermaphrodites," and saw below them the wide bridge, almost a half a
mile long, which spans the Severn.The draw was open, to let a motor
boat pass through, but it closed before they reached it.Macloud exclaimed, drawing rein,
midway."Look at the high bluff, on the farther shore, with the view up
the river, on one side, and down the Bay, and clear across on the
other.... Now," as they wound up on the hill, "for the first road to
the right."laughed Croyden, as the road swung
abruptly westward and directly away from Greenberry Point."Let us go a little farther," said Macloud."There must be a way--a
bridle path, if nothing better--and, if we must, we can push straight
through the timber; there doesn't seem to be any fences.You see, it
was rational to ride."as one unexpectedly took off to the right,
among the trees, and bore almost immediately eastward.Presently they were startled by a series of explosions, a short
distance ahead.said Croyden, with mock
seriousness.We must be a mile and more from the Point.It's
some one blasting, I think.""It wasn't sufficiently muffled," Croyden answered.They waited a few moments: hearing no further noises, they proceeded--a
trifle cautiously, however.A little further on, they came upon a wood
cutter."He doesn't appear at all alarmed," Croyden observed."What were the
explosions, a minute ago?""They weren't nothing," said the man, leaning on his axe."The Navy's
got a'speriment house over here.Yer don't
need be skeered.If yer goin' to the station, it's just a little ways,
now," he added, with the country-man's curiosity--which they did not
satisfy.They passed the buildings of the Experiment Station and continued on,
amid pine and dogwood, elms and beeches.They were travelling parallel
with the Severn, and not very distant, as occasional glimpses of blue
water, through the trees, revealed.The
river became plainly visible with the Bay itself shimmering to the
fore.Then the trees ended abruptly, and they came out on Greenberry
Point: a long, flat, triangular-shaped piece of ground, possibly two
hundred yards across the base, and three hundred from base to point."Somewhere near here, possibly just where your horse is standing, is
the treasure," said Macloud.laughed Croyden, "and that appears to be my only chance,
for I can't see a trace of the trees which formed the square.""Remember, you didn't expect to
find things marked off for you."It's amazingly easier than I dared to hope."we can't dig six feet deep over all of forty acres.We
shall have the whole of Annapolis over to help us before we've done a
square of forty feet.""The instructions say: seven hundred and fifty feet
back, from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, is the quadrangle of
trees.That was in 1720, one hundred and ninety years ago.They must
have been of good size then--hence, they would be of the greater size,
now, or else have disappeared entirely.There isn't a single tree which
could correspond with Parmenter's, closer than four hundred yards, and,
as the point would have been receding rather than gaining, we can
assume, with tolerable certainty, that the beeches have
vanished--either from decay or from wind storms, which must be very
severe over in this exposed land.Hence, must not our first quest be
for some trace of the trees?""That sounds reasonable," said Croyden, "and, if the Point has receded,
which is altogether likely, then we are pretty near the place.""Yes!--if the Point has simply receded, but if it has shifted
laterally, as well, the problem is not so simple.""Let us go out to the Point, and look at the ruins of the light-house.If we can get near enough to ascertain when it was built, it may help
us.Evidently there was none erected here, in Parmenter's time, else
he would not have chosen this place to hide his treasure."But the light-house was a barren yield.It was a crumbling mass of
ruins, lying out in water, possibly fifty feet--the real house was a
bug-light farther out in the Bay.Mary moved to the garden."Well, there's no one to see us, so why shouldn't we make a search for
the trees?"He went out on the extreme edge, faced about, and taking a line at
right angles to it, stepped two hundred and fifty paces.He ended in
sand--and, for another fifty paces, sand--sand unrelieved by aught save
some low bushes sparsely scattered here and there."Somewhere hereabout, according to present conditions, the trees should
be," he said."Not very promising," was Croyden's comment."Let us assume that the diagonal lines drawn between the trees
intersect at this point," Macloud continued, producing a compass."Then, one hundred and ten paces North-by-North-East is the place we
seek."Sandra moved to the hallway.He stepped the distance carefully--Croyden following with the
horses--and sunk his heel into the sand beside a clump of wire grass."Here is the old buccaneer's hoard!"[Illustration: HE WENT OUT ON THE EXTREME EDGE, FACED ABOUT, AND STEPPED
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES]

"You dig--I'll hold the horses; your hands are tougher than mine."You mean, you would try to purchase
it?""Yes, as a site for a house, ostensibly.I might buy a lot beginning,
say one hundred and fifty yards back from the Point, and running, at an
even width of two hundred yards, from the Severn to the Bay."If the present owner will sell," appended Croyden--"and if his price
isn't out of all reason.I can't go much expense, you know.""Never mind the expense--that can be arranged.If he will sell, the
rest is easy."And we will share equally, then," said Croyden."I've got more money than I want, let me have
some fun with the excess, Croyden.And this promises more fun than I've
had for a year--hunting a buried treasure, within sight of Maryland's
capital.Moreover, it won't likely be out of reach of your own
pocketbook, this can't be very valuable land.""Let us ride around over the intended site, and prospect--we may
discover something."But, though, they searched for an hour, they were utterly unsuccessful.The four beech trees had disappeared as completely as though they never
were."I'm perfectly confident, however," Macloud remarked as they turned
away toward town, "that somewhere, within the lines of your proposed
lot, lie the Parmenter jewels.Once you have title to
it, you may plow up the whole thing to any depth you please, and no one
may gainsay you.""I'm not so sure," replied Croyden."My knowing that the treasure was
on it when purchased, may make me liable to my grantor for an
accounting.""Yet, I have every reason to believe--the letter is most specific.""Suppose, after you've paid a big price for the land, you don't find
the treasure, could you make him take it back and refund the purchase
money?""No, most assuredly, no," smiled Croyden.You must account for what you find--if you
don't find it, you must keep the land, anyway."It's predicated on the proposition that I have knowingly deceived him
into selling something for nothing.However, I'm not at all clear about
it; and we will buy if we can--and take the chances.But we won't go to
work with a brass band, old man."At the top of the hill, beyond the Severn, there was a road which took
off to the left."This parallels the road by the Marine Barracks, suppose we turn in
here," Macloud said.A little way on, they passed what was evidently a fine hospital, with
the United States flag flying over it.John journeyed to the kitchen.Just beyond, occupying the point
of land where College Creek empties into the Severn, was the Naval
Cemetery."They have the place of interment
exceedingly handy to the hospital.he asked,
indicating a huge dome, hideously ornate with gold and white, that
projected above the trees, some distance ahead.John journeyed to the office."Unless it's a custard-and-cream pudding
for the Midshipmen's supper.I
recollect now: the Government has spent millions in erecting new
Academy buildings; and someone in the Navy remarked, 'If a certain chap
_had_ to kill somebody, he couldn't see why he hadn't selected the
fellow who was responsible for them--his work at Annapolis would have
been ample justification.'Judging from the atrocity to our fore, the
officer didn't overdraw it."They took the road along the officers' quarters on Upshur Row, and came
out the upper gate into King George Street, thereby missing the Chapel
(of the custard-and-cream dome) and all the other Smith buildings."The real estate agent is more
important now."It was the quiet hour when they got back to the hotel, and the clerk
was standing in the doorway, sunning himself."It wasn't bad," returned Croyden."Can you tell me
who owns Greenberry Point?"The Government owns it--they bought it for the Rifle
Range."John went back to the hallway."Yes, sir!--from the Point clear up to the Experiment Station.""That's the end of the purchase idea!""I thought it was'most
too good to last.""It got punctured very early," Macloud agreed.Daniel moved to the office."And the question is, what to do, now?Titles in a small
town are known, particularly, when they're in the United States.However, it's easy to verify--we'll hunt up a real estate
office--they'll know."But when they had dressed, and sought a real estate office, the last
doubt vanished: it confirmed the clerk."If you haven't anything particularly pressing," said Macloud, "I
suggest that we remain here for a few days and consider what is best to
do.""My most pressing business is to find the treasure!"then we're on the job until it's found--if it takes a year or
longer."And when Croyden looked his surprise: "I've nothing to do, old
chap, and one doesn't have the opportunity to go treasure hunting more
than once in a lifetime.Picture our satisfaction when we hear the pick
strike the iron box, and see the lid turned back, and the jewels
coruscating before us.""But what if there isn't any coruscating--that's a good word, old
man--nor any iron box?""Don't be so pessimistic--_think_ we're going to find it, it will help
a lot.""How about if we _don't_ find it?""Then, at least, we'll have had a good time in hunting, and have done
our best to succeed.""It's a new thing to hear old cynical Macloud preaching optimism!"laughed Croyden--"our last talk, in Northumberland, wasn't particularly
in that line, you'll remember.""Our talk in Northumberland had to do with other people and
conditions.This is an adventure, and has to do solely with ourselves.Some difference, my dear Croyden, some difference!What do you say to
an early breakfast to-morrow, and then a walk over to the Point.It's
something like your Eastern Shore to get to, however,--just across the
river by water, but three miles around by the Severn bridge.We can
have the whole day for prospecting.""I'm under your orders," said Croyden."You're in charge of this
expedition."They had been passing numerous naval officers in uniform, some well
set-up, some slouchy."The uniform surely does show up the man for what he is," said Macloud."Look at these two for instance--from the stripes on the sleeves, a
Lieutenant-Commander and a Senior Lieutenant.Did you ever see a real
Bowery tough?--they are in that class, with just enough veneer to
deceive, for an instant.Observe the dignity, the snappy walk, the inherent air
of command.""Isn't it the fault of the system?""Every Congressman
holds a competitive examination in his district; and the appointment
goes to the applicant who wins--be he what he may.For that reason, I
dare say, the Brigade of Midshipmen contains muckers as well as
gentlemen--and officers are but midshipmen of a larger growth."To be a commissioned officer, in
either Army or Navy, ought to attest one's gentle birth.""It raises a presumption in their favor, at least."do you think the two who passed us could hide behind that
presumption longer than the fraction of an instant?"I was accounting for it, not defending it.It's a pity, of course, but that's one of the misfortunes of a Republic
where all men are equal.""Men aren't equal!--they're born to
different social scales, different intellectualities, different
conditions otherwise.For the purpose of suffrage they may, in the
theory of our government, be equal--but we haven't yet demonstrated it.We have included the <DW64
