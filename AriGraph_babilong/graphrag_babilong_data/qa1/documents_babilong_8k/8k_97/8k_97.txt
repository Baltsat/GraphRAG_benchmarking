A suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive
examination of the narrow tubes.All, whatever the number of their
inmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes
would be.It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the
back was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large
front gallery, but as an independent tube.The facility with which the
worker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of
action, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the
outer air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the
narrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not
exist.This would account for the placing of the female in the large
tube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her
custom.I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates
the danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering
only the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable
to remain imprisoned.At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as
little as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of
both sexes.This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to
colonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males.However, so far
as we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times
in the Osmia's little brain.Enough for us to know that she dislikes
narrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they
are at the same time long.And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same
diameter.Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail.With the short tube
the two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided.She has very little
of that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the
home of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the
Mason-bee.Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at
most, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to
a long series.To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long
enough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow
enough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to
me a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would
stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with
entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it.On the other
hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,
seems to me at least quite possible.Guided by these considerations, I
embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the
complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to
produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a
series of lodgings suited only to males.Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs.I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with
little cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the
Three-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in
the deep cells and males in the shallow cells.That is how things go
when the old nest remains in its natural state.With a grater, however,
I scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the
cavities to some ten millimetres.(About two-fifths of an
inch.--Translator's Note.)This leaves in each cell just room for one
cocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper.Of the fourteen cavities in
the nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.)Nothing could be more striking than
the result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home
rearing.Daniel moved to the garden.The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received
males; the two cavities left untouched received females.A year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;
but this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the
grater.Sandra went back to the garden.Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by
males.It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the
offspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot
and kept in sight as long as her laying lasted.He would indeed be
difficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two
experiments.If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to
remove his last doubts.The Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,
especially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common
under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared
walls that support our terraces.In this species the spiral is wide
open, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage
permits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to
pass, the space necessary for the cell of a female.This cell is
succeeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a
line in the same way as in a straight tube.In the last whorl of the
spiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row.Then
longitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the
whole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males
predominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys.The
sequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube
and especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is
complicated by subdivisions on the same level.A single Snail-shell
contains room for six or eight cells.A large, rough earthen stopper
finishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.As a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my
swarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a
small swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the
usable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that
required by a male Osmia-cocoon.Moreover, the widest part, in which a
female might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below
which there will often be a free space.Under all these conditions, the
house will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.The collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes
specimens of different sizes.The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7
inch.--Translator's Note.)in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.)There is room for two cocoons, or
three at most, according to their dimensions.Now these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,
perhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery
sides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee.Some of them were
occupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had
started with a home of this sort would pass next to a second
Snail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a
fourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were
emptied.The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in
Snail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a
description of the worker.The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell
were in the minority.The greater number left the tubes to come to the
shells and then went back from the shells to the tubes.All, after
filling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house
with a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening.It was a long
and troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as
a mother and all her talents as a plasterer.When the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these
elegant abodes.The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my
anticipations to the letter.The great, the very great majority of the
cocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a
few rare females appear.The smallness of the space has almost done
away with the stronger sex.This result is demonstrated by the
sixty-eight Snail-shells colonized.But, of this total number, I must
use only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied
by the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season.Here
are a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.From the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,
the date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven
Snail-shells in succession.Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a
number very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve
belong to males and only two to females.Another, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with
a family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.A third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,
a prodigious task.She supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have
ever obtained from one Osmia.Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of
twenty-five males and one female.There is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially
as the other series would all, without exception, give us the same
result.Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse
the order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of
males before producing any females.There is something better still;
and this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:
the female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to
the point of disappearing altogether.We see this especially in the
third case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of
twenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding
Snail-shell.There would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only
females and no males, or very few.The first permutation makes the
second seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of
realizing it.The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions
of the home.When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females
tend to disappear.With generous quarters, the converse would not take
place.Address Frank Tousey, publisher,                     New York.THE LARGEST AND BEST LIBRARY.1 Dick Decker, the Brave Young Fireman         by Ex Fire Chief Warden

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she
answered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The
Sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across
from the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,
and the little eyes receded comically, like a pig's."Well, I've been thinking serious of late about getting married," he
continued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don't cal'late
to be a sentimental critter.I'm not much on high-sounding phrases, and
such things, but I'd give you my word I'd make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that
was the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis
without a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I'd be a rich man before
I left it.If I was to die now, I'd have kept that promise.I'm not
thirty-four, and I cal'late I've got as much money in a safe place as a
good many men you call rich.I'm not saying what I've got, mind you.I've stopped chewing--there was a time when I
done that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a
rebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead
against it.You wouldn't like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn't," she
said."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal
twang."Well, as I was saying, I've about got ready to settle down, and
I've had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her
bewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set
eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for
you to marry.'I'm plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work
right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I'm a plain business man with no frills.You're the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You'll need a man
with a fortune, and a big one; you're the sort to show it off.I've got
the foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I
tell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper
will be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,
his confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment
was still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,
as he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision
arose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She
thought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this
proposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet's
face, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who
rose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried
by--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes
over the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be
thought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had
lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would
buy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent
desire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for
many a day."You--won't--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with
the shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back
against a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over
the bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and
indiscretion entered his soul.You've got no notion of my
money, I say."If you owned the whole of
California, I would not marry you."He
slipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew
out some papers."I cal'late you ain't got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he
said; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You're poor, but I guess
you don't know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel's a man of honor,
ain't he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she
stayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain't much use in your lookin' over
them papers.I'll tell you what they say: they
say that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a
physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal'late you despise me, don't you?"he went on, as if that, too,
gave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel's a beggar but for me.All you've got to do is to say you'll be my
wife, and I tear these notes in two.(He
made the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company's an old firm,--a
respected firm.John moved to the kitchen.You wouldn't care to see it go out of the family, I
cal'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path
wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in
front of the house.His
pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent
forward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Mary went back to the bathroom.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.Mary journeyed to the garden.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and
mine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar
posture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,
stroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they
sought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I'm
some use yet awhile.It isn't right that I should idle here, while
the South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a
Pennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel
had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay
flowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that
his heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,
and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the
glory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I
reckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I
