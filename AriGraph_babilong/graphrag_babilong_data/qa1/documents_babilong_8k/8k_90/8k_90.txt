They will often snore quite loudly, so that a novice may
consider that they are ill.Rock salt should be within reach for them to lick, together with good
clean water.If a trough is used for the latter it should be cleaned
out at intervals, and if a pond or ditch is the drinking place, there
should be a stone mouth so as to avoid stalking in the mud.A healthy
horse is a hungry horse, therefore the feed should be cleaned up before
the next is put in.This must be noted in the case of foals just
weaned.Any left over should be taken away and given to older horses,
so that the little ones receive a sweet and palatable meal.Condition and bloom may be obtained by adding a small quantity of
boiled barley or a handful of linseed meal to the food above mentioned,
while horses lying in should have a boiled linseed and bran mash about
once a week.It should be remembered, as before stated, that horses are not like
cattle, sheep, or pigs, being fattened to be killed.Sandra moved to the bathroom.They have a
comparatively long life in front of them, so that it is necessary to
build up a good constitution.Then they may change hands many times,
and if they pass from where cooked foods and condiments are largely
used to where plain food is given they are apt to refuse it and lose
flesh in consequence, thus leading the new owner to suppose that he
has got a bad bargain.Reference has already been made to the pernicious system of stuffing
show-animals, and it is not often that farmers err in this direction.They are usually satisfied with feeding their horses on sound and
wholesome home-grown food without purchasing costly extras to make
their horses into choice feeders.It is always better for the breeder of any class of stock if the
animals he sells give satisfaction to the purchasers, and this is
particularly true of Shire horses.A doubtful breeder or one which is
not all that it should be may be fattened up and sold at more than its
market value, but the buyer would not be likely to go to the same man
if he wanted another horse, therefore it is better to gain a reputation
for honest dealing and to make every effort to keep it.It might be here mentioned that it is not at all satisfactory to rear
a Shire foal by itself, even if it will stay in its paddock.It never
thrives as well as when with company, and often stands with its head
down looking very mopish and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is
not a suitable undertaking for a small holder, although he may keep
a good brood-mare to do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning
time.In the absence of a second foal a donkey is sometimes used as a
companion to a single one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory
playfellow, therefore the farmer with only one had far better sell it
straight from the teat, or if he has suitable accommodation he should
buy another to lie with it and rear the two together.Of course, two
will need more food than one, but no more journeys will be required to
carry it to the manger.Care should be taken, however, to buy one quite
as good, and if possible better, than the home-bred one.If they are to make geldings the colour should match, but if for
breeding purposes the colour need not necessarily be the same.Except
for making a working gelding, however, chestnuts should be avoided.It
is not a desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed enough of that
shade without buying one.A remark which may be also made with regard
to unsound ones, viz.that most horse-breeders get enough of them
without buying.During their second summer--that is as yearlings--Shires not wanted for
show purposes should be able to do themselves well at grass, supposing
the land is of average quality and not overstocked, but if the soil
is very poor it may be necessary to give a small feed once a day, of
which pulped mangolds may form a part if they are plentiful.This extra
feeding is better than stunting the growth, and the aim is to get a big
romping two-year-old colt, filly, or gelding as the case may be.Colts not up to the desired standard should be operated on during their
yearling days, preferably in May or June, and, as before indicated,
merit should be conspicuous in those left for stud purposes, while the
back breeding on both sides counts for much in a stallion.That is why
Lockinge Forest King, Childwick Champion, and a few others which could
be named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.After June or July colts should be separated from fillies unless the
colts have been castrated, and they must be put inside good fences,
this being something of a puzzle to a farmer with a few paddocks and
poor fences.Consequently, a second or third-rate young stallion often
causes a good deal of trouble, in fact, more than he leaves a return
for.For the second winter the young Shires still need a bit of help.If
they are to make, or are likely to make, anything out of the common
they should be fed liberally, otherwise a feed of chaff and corn once a
day will do, with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it must be good
wholesome forage.During their second spring, or when two years old, they should be put
to work as described in a former chapter, after which they are able at
least to earn their keep; the cost of rearing on the lines indicated up
to this age will be found to be considerable, so that a good saleable
animal is needed to make the business a profitable one; but I have kept
the rearing of good sound Shires in view, not crocks or mongrels.The effect of the war on the cost of feeding horses has led the Board
of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse owners
of substitutes for oats.When it was written beans were relatively
cheaper, so was maize, while rice-meal was recommended to form part of
the mixture, owing to its lower cost.Those who have fed horses are aware that they do not like any food
which is of a dusty nature.It sticks in their nostrils, causing them
annoyance, if not discomfort, which a horse indicates by blowing its
nose frequently.Any kind of light meal should therefore be fed either with damp chaff
or with pulped roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner described
elsewhere.If mangolds have to be purchased at £1 per ton, they help to
make the meals more palatable.The farmer who grows a variety of corn
and roots is usually able to prepare and blend his own foods so as to
make a diet on which horses will thrive although oats are scarce.In Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are largely used for farm horses,
but coal and labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.CHAPTER VII

CARE OF THE FEET


There is no part of a Shire to which more attention should be paid
than the feet, and it is safe to say that the foot of the present-day
cart-horse is infinitely better than were those of his ancestors of
forty, or even twenty, years ago.The shape as well as the size has
been improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is rarely met with, at least
in show animals of this breed.It is always advisable to keep the feet of foals, yearlings, and
two-year-olds attended to whether they are required for show or not,
and if they have their feet quietly picked up and the edges rasped, the
heels being lowered a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented from
breaking, and a better and more durable hoof well repays the trouble,
moreover the task of fixing the first set of shoes--which used to be
quite a tough job for the smith when the colts were neglected till
they were three years old--is rendered quite easy.Except for travelling on the road, or when required for show, there is
no advantage in keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they should be
taken off when lying idle, or if worked only on soft ground shoes are
not actually necessary.Where several are lying together, or even two, those with shoes on may
cause ugly wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with the naked hoof
is not often serious.There is also a possibility that colts turned
away to grass with their shoes on will have the removing neglected, and
thus get corns, so that the shoeless hoof is always better for young
Shires so long as it is sound and normal.If not, of course, it should
be treated accordingly.In a dry summer, when the ground is very hard, it may be advisable
to use tips so that the foot may be preserved, this being especially
necessary in the case of thin and brittle hoofs.For growing and preserving good strong feet in Shire horses clay land
seems to answer best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land farms
almost invariably possess tough horn on which a shoe can be affixed to
last till it wears out.For the purpose of improving weak feet in young Shires turning them out
in cool clay land may be recommended, taking care to assist the growth
by keeping the heels open so that the frog comes into contact with the
ground.Weakness in the feet has been regarded, and rightly so, as a bad fault
in a Shire stallion, therefore good judges have always been particular
to put bottoms first when judging.Horses of all kinds have to travel,
which they cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time if their
feet are ill-formed or diseased, and it should be borne in mind that
a good or a bad foot can be inherited.“No foot, no horse,” is an old
and true belief.During the past few years farmers have certainly paid
more attention to the feet of their young stock because more of them
are shown, the remarks of judges and critics having taught them that
a good top cannot atone for poor bottoms, seeing that Shires are not
like stationary engines, made to do their work standing.They have to
spend a good part of their lives on hard roads or paved streets, where
contracted or tender feet quickly come to grief, therefore those who
want to produce saleable Shires should select parents with the approved
type of pedals, and see that those of the offspring do not go wrong
through neglect or mismanagement.There is no doubt that a set of good feet often places an otherwise
moderate Shire above one which has other good points but lacks this
essential; therefore all breeders of Shires should devote time and
attention to the production of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering
the oft-quoted line, “The top may come, the bottom never.” In diseases
of the feet it is those in front which are the most certain to go
wrong, and it is these which judges and buyers notice more particularly.If fever manifests itself it is generally in the fore feet; while
side-bone, ring-bone, and the like are incidental to the front coronets.Clay land has been spoken of for rearing Shires, but there are various
kinds of soil in England, all of which can be utilized as a breeding
ground for the Old English type of cart-horses.In Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working red land, in Herts a
chalky soil prevails, yet champions abound there; while very light
sandy farms are capable of producing high-class Shires if the farmer
thereof sets his mind on getting them, and makes up for the poorness or
unsuitability of the soil by judicious feeding and careful management.It may be here stated that an arable farm can be made to produce a
good deal more horse forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,
therefore more horses can be kept on the former.Heavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne, etc., can be grown and mown
twice in the season, whereas grass can only be cut once.Daniel moved to the bedroom.Oats and
oat straw are necessary, or at least desirable, for the rearing of
horses, so are carrots, golden tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an
arable-land farmer may certainly be a Shire horse breeder.This is getting away from the subject of feet, however, and it may be
returned to by saying that stable management counts for a good deal in
the growth and maintenance of a sound and healthy hoof.Good floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet in which roots appear,
moving shoes at regular intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not
rasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow shoe, may be mentioned as
aids in retaining good feet.As stated, the improvement in this particular has been very noticeable
since the writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but perfection
has not yet been reached, therefore it remains for the breeders of the
present and the future to strive after it.There was a time when exhibitors of “Agricultural” horses stopped the
cracks and crevices in their horses’ feet with something in the nature
of putty, which is proved by reading a report of the Leeds Royal of
1861, where “the judges discovered the feet of one of the heavy horses
to be stopped with gutta-percha and pitch.”




CHAPTER VIII

HOW TO SHOW A SHIRE


A few remarks on the above subject will not come amiss, at least to
the uninitiated, for it is tolerably certain that, other things being
equal, the candidate for honours which makes the best show when it is
actually before the judges stands the first chance of securing the
honours.John went to the office.It must not be expected that a colt can be fetched out of a grass field
one day and trained well enough to show himself off creditably in the
ring the next; and a rough raw colt makes both itself and its groom
look small.Training properly takes time and patience, and it is best
to begin early with the process, from birth for choice.The lessons
need not, and certainly should not, be either long or severe at the
outset, but just enough to teach the youngster what is required of him.When teaching horses to stand at “attention” they should not be made to
stretch themselves out as if they were wanted to reach from one side
of the ring to the other, neither should they be allowed to stand like
an elephant on a tub.They should be taught to stand squarely on all
fours in a becoming and businesslike way.The best place for the groom
when a horse is wanted to stand still is exactly in front and facing
the animal.The rein is usually gripped about a foot from the head.Mares can often be allowed a little more “head,” but with stallions
it may be better to take hold close to the bit, always remembering to
have the loop end of the rein in the palm, in case he suddenly rears
or plunges.The leader should “go with his horse,” or keep step with
him, but need not “pick up” in such a manner as to make it appear to
bystanders that he is trying to make up for the shortcomings of his
horse.Both horse and man want to practise the performance in the home paddock
a good many times before perfection can be reached, and certainly
a little time thus spent is better than making a bad show when the
critical moment arrives that they are both called out to exhibit
themselves before a crowd of critics.If well trained the horse will respond to the call of the judges with
only a word, and no whip or stick need be used to get it through the
required walks and trots, or back to its place in the rank.There is a class of men who would profit by giving a little time to
training young horse stock, and that is the farmers who breed but do
not show.Of course, “professional show-men” (as they are sometimes
called) prefer to “buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the polish
themselves, and then take the profits for so doing.But why should not
the breeder make his animals show to their very best, and so get a
better price into his own pocket?John went back to the kitchen.Finally, I would respectfully suggest that if some of the horse show
societies were to have a horse-showing competition, _i.e._ give prizes
to the men who showed out a horse in the best manner, it would be both
interesting and instructive to horse lovers.CHAPTER IX

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SHIRE


It is evident that a breed of comparatively heavy horses existed in
Britain at the time of the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s
warriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were on foot) in war chariots
drawn by active but powerful horses, remarkable--as Sir Walter Gilbey’s
book on “The Great Horse” says--for “strength, substance, courage and
docility.”

These characteristics have been retained and improved upon all down the
ages since.The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow down the
enemy was superseded by regiments of cavalry, the animals ridden being
the Old English type of War Horse.In those days it was the lighter or
second-rate animals, what we may call “the culls,” which were left for
agricultural purposes.The English knight, when clad in armour, weighed
something like 4 cwt., therefore a weedy animal would have sunk under
such a burden.This evidently forced the early breeders to avoid long backs by
breeding from strong-loined, deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,
seeing that slackness meant weakness and, therefore, worthlessness for
war purposes.It is easy to understand that a long-backed, light-middled mount with
a weight of 4 cwt.on his back would simply double up when stopped
suddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe at the head of his
antagonist, so we find from pictures and plates that the War Horse of
those far-off days was wide and muscular in his build, very full in his
thighs, while the saddle in use reached almost from the withers to the
hips, thus proving that the back was short.There came a time, however, when speed and mobility were preferred to
mere weight.The knight cast away his armour and selected a lighter and
fleeter mount than the War Horse of the ancient Britons.The change was, perhaps, began at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314.It is recorded that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that battle, on
which he dodged the charges of the ponderous English knights, and
he took a very heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of their
massive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable to suppose that some
of the latter were used for breeding purposes, and thus helped to build
up the Scottish, or Clydesdale, breed of heavy horses; but what was
England’s loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale breed had
a class devoted to it at the Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas
his English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive recognition by the
Royal Agricultural Society of England till 1883, sixty years later.Mary travelled to the office.As
a War Horse the British breed known as “The Great Horse” seems to have
been at its best between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the date of
Bannockburn above-mentioned, owing to the fact that the Norman nobles,
who came over with William the Conqueror, fought on horseback, whereas
the Britons of old used to dismount out of their chariots, and fight on
foot.The Battle of Hastings was waged between Harold’s English Army of
infantry-men and William the Conqueror’s Army of horsemen, ending in a
victory for the latter.The Flemish horses thus became known to English horse breeders, and
they were certainly used to help lay the foundation of the Old English
breed of cart horses.It is clear that horses with substance were used for drawing chariots
at the Roman invasion in the year 55 B.C., but no great development
in horse-breeding took place in England till the Normans proved that
warriors could fight more effectively on horseback than on foot.After
this the noblemen of England appear to have set store by their horses,
consequently the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be regarded
as the age in which Britain’s breed of heavy horses became firmly
established.In Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation showing that “Cart Horses
fit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot” were on sale at
Smithfield (London) every Friday, the extract being made from a book
written about 1154, and from the same source we learn that during the
reign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred stallions “of large stature”
were imported from the low countries--Flanders and Holland.Passing from this large importation to the time of the famous Robert
Bakewell of Dishley (1726-1795), we find that he too went to Flanders
for stock to improve his cart horses, but instead of returning
with stallions he bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,
these being of the old black breed peculiar--in those days--to
Leicestershire.There is no doubt that the interest taken by this great
breed improver in the Old English type of cart horse had an effect far
more important than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed of cattle,
seeing that this has long lost its popularity, whereas that of the
Shire horse has been growing and widening from that day to this.Bakewell was the first English stockbreeder to let his stud animals for
the season, and although his greatest success was achieved with the
Dishley or “New Leicester” sheep, he also carried on the system with
Longhorn bulls and his cart horses, which were described as “Bakewell’s
Blacks.”

That his horses had a reputation is proved by the fact that in 1785
he had the honour of exhibiting a black horse before King George III.James’s Palace, but another horse named “K,” said by Marshall
to have died in that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen years,
was described by the writer just quoted as a better animal than that
inspected by His Majesty the King.From the description given he
appears to have had a commanding forehand and to have carried his head
so high that his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore feet, as
Bakewell held that the head of a cart horse should.It can hardly be
questioned that he was a believer in weight, seeing that his horses
were “thick and short in body, on very short legs.”

The highest price he is credited with getting for the hire of a
stallion for a season is 150 guineas, while the service fee at home is
said to have been five guineas, which looks a small amount compared
with the 800 guineas obtained for the use of his ram “Two Pounder” for
a season.What is of more importance to Shire horse breeders, however, is the
fact that Robert Bakewell not only improved and popularized the Shire
horse of his day, but he instituted the system of letting out sires
for the season, which has been the means of placing good sires before
farmers, thus enabling them to assist in the improvement which has made
such strides since the formation of the Shire Horse Society in 1878.It is worth while to note that Bakewell’s horses were said to be
“perfectly gentle, willing workers, and of great power.” He held that
bad pullers were made so by bad management.Daniel journeyed to the office.He used two in front of
a Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being “four acres a day.”
Surely a splendid advertisement for the Shire as a plough horse.FLEMISH BLOOD

In view of the fact that Flanders has been very much in the public eye
for the past few months owing to its having been converted into a vast
battlefield, it is interesting to remember that we English farmers of
to-day owe at least something of the size, substance and soundness of
our Shire horses to the Flemish horse breeders of bygone days.Bakewell
is known to have obtained marvellous results among his cattle and sheep
by means of in-breeding, therefore we may assume that he would not have
gone to the Continent for an outcross for his horses unless he regarded
such a step beneficial to the breed.It is recorded by George Culley that a certain Earl of Huntingdon had
returned from the Low Countries--where he had been Ambassador--with a
set of black coach horses, mostly stallions.These were used by the
Trentside farmers, and without a doubt so impressed Bakewell as to
induce him to pay a visit to the country whence they came.If we turn from the history of the Shire to that of the Clydesdale it
will be found that the imported Flemish stallions are credited by the
most eminent authorities, with adding size to the North British breed
of draught horses.The Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous for their interest in horse
breeding.One was said to have imported six black Flemish stallions--to
cross with the native mares--towards the close of the seventeenth
century, while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported one, which he
named “Clyde.”

This is notable, because it proves that both the English and Scotch
breeds have obtained size from the very country now devastated by war.It may be here mentioned that one of the greatest lovers and breeders
of heavy horses during the nineteenth century was schooled on the Duke
of Hamilton’s estate, and he was eminently successful in blending the
Shire and Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and sires which
have done much towards building up the modern Clydesdale.Lawrence Drew, of Merryton, who, like Mr.Robert Bakewell,
had the distinction of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince of Wales)
before Royalty.Drew) bought many Shires in the Midland
Counties of England.So keen was his judgment that he would “spot a
winner” from a railway carriage, and has been known to alight at the
next station and make the journey back to the farm where he saw the
likely animal.On at least one occasion the farmer would not sell the best by itself,
so the enthusiast bought the whole team, which he had seen at plough
from the carriage window on the railway.Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion purchased by Mr.Drew in
England was Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession in 1878.This horse won several prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and he
also begot Lincolnshire Lad II.1365, the sire of Harold 3703, Champion
of the London Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby Harold (Champion
in London as a yearling, a three-year-old and a four-year-old),
Markeaton Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of Queen of the
Shires, the Champion mare of the same year, 1897, and numerous other
celebrities.Drew in Derbyshire, was Flora,
by Lincolnshire Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a great winner, and
the dam of Prince of Clay, Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all
of which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters of the first rank.John went to the hallway.There is evidence to show that heavy horses from other countries than
Flanders were imported, but this much is perfectly clear, that the
Flemish breed was selected to impart size, therefore, if we give honour
where it is due, these “big and handsome” black stallions that we read
of deserve credit for helping to build up the breed of draught horses
in Britain, which is universally known as the Shire, its distinguishing
feature being that it is the heaviest breed in existence.CHAPTER X

FACTS AND FIGURES


The London Show of 1890 was a remarkable one in more than one sense.The entries totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.This led to the
adoption of measures to prevent exhibitors from making more than two
entries in one class.The year 1889 holds the record, so far, for the
number of export certificates granted by the Shire Horse Society, the
total being 1264 against 346 in 1913, yet Shires were much dearer in
the latter year than in the former.John went to the bathroom.Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old stallions shown in
London was 161, while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the rule of
charging double fees for more than two entries from one exhibitor.Another innovation was the passing of a rule that every animal entered
for show should be passed by a veterinary surgeon, this being the form
of certificate drawn up:--

    “I hereby certify that ________ entered by Mr.________ for
    exhibition at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show, 1891,
    has been examined by me and, in my opinion, is free from the
    following hereditary diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling),
    Ringbone, Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin, Cataract,
    Sidebone, Shivering.”

These alterations led to a smaller show in 1891 (which was the first at
which the writer had the honour of leading round a candidate, exhibited
by a gentleman who subsequently bred several London winners, and who
served on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).But to hark back to
the 1890 Show.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s
(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the
Sort the Second, made £1000 at the show after winning third prize; the
second-prize colt in the same class being sold for £700.The Champion mare was Starlight, then owned by Mr.R. N.
Sutton-Nelthorpe, but sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,
for 925 guineas to Mr.Fred Crisp--who held a prominent place in the
Shire Horse world for several years.Starlight rewarded him by winning
Champion prize both in 1891 and 1892, her three successive victories
being a record in championships for females at the London Show.Others
have won highest honours thrice, but, so far, not in successive years.In 1890 the number of members of the Shire Horse Society was 1615, the
amount given in prizes being just over £700.A curious thing about that
1890 meeting, with its great entry, was that it resulted in a loss of
£1300 to the Society, but in those days farmers did not attend in their
thousands as they do now.The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the number of members being 4200, and
the entries totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at the time
this is being written, for distribution at the Shire Horse Show of
1915, which will be held when this country has, with the help of her
Allies, waged a great war for seven months, yet before it had been
carried on for seven days show committees in various parts of the
country cancelled their shows, being evidently under the impression
that “all was in the dust.” With horses of all grades at a premium, any
method of directing the attention of farmers and breeders generally
to the scarcity that is certain to exist is justifiable, particularly
that which provides for over two thousand pounds being spent among
members of what is admitted to be the most flourishing breed society in
existence.At the London Show of 1895 two classes for geldings were added to
the prize schedule, making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two
geldings the total was only 489, so that it was a small show, its most
notable feature being that Mr.A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha won
the Challenge Cup for mares and died later.Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and mares commenced with the
eldest, so that Class I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,
the yearlings coming last, the mare classes following in like order.But for the 1898 Show a desirable change was made by putting the
yearlings first, and following on with classes in the order of age.At
this show, 1898, Sir Alexander Henderson performed the unique feat of
winning not only the male and female Challenge Cups, but also the other
two, so that he had four cup winners, three of them being sire, dam,
and son, viz.Markeaton Royal Harold, Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this
made the victory particularly noteworthy.The last named also succeeded
in winning champion honours in 1899 and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight.The cup-winning gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had won similar honours
the previous year for Mr.W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.He possessed both weight and quality, and it is doubtful
if a better gelding has been exhibited since.He was also cup winner
again in 1899, consequently he holds the record for geldings at the
London Show.It should have been mentioned that the system of giving breeders prizes
was introduced at the Show of 1896, the first prizes being reduced
from £25 to £20 in the case of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those
for mares, to allow the breeder of the first prize animal £10 in each
breeding class, and the breeder of each second-prize stallion or mare
£5, the latter sum being awarded to breeders of first-prize geldings.This was a move in the right direction, and certainly gave the Shire
