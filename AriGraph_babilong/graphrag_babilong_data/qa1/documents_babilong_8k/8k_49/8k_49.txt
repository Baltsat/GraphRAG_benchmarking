The building was constructed
in 1850 by the Elfelt brothers and the ground floor was occupied by
them as a dry goods store.It is one of the very oldest buildings in
the city.The name of Elfelt brothers until quite recently could be
seen on the Exchange street side of the building.The hall was named
Mazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s
took place in this old building.At a ball given in the hall during
one of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Ward,
bookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter
of one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance
of about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got
married.They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was
known all over the town the next day and produced great commotion.Miss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they
were finally divorced without having lived together.For a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in
this building.Heitz had participated in a number of battles under
the great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the
graphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often
relate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster
stew.*       *       *       *       *

During the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large
buildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel.Mozart hall was on
the Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner.At
a sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls
were thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was
held for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary
commission.Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the
principal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword
to the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the
front.A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities
on this plan, and the name of Col.Marshall of the Seventh regiment
and Col.Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it
was thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a
large vote.The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side
had some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number
of votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close
to carry off the prize.Uline had been a fireman and was very
popular with the young men of the city.Marshall was backed by
friends in the different newspaper offices.The contest was very
spirited and resulted in Col.Uline capturing the sword, he having
received more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last
five minutes the polls were open.This fair was very successful,
the patriotic citizens of St.Paul having enriched the funds of the
sanitary commission by several thousand dollars.*       *       *       *       *

One of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge
Square, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall.Whether it
was named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its
beverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine.*       *       *       *       *

In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more
pomp and glory than any holiday during the year.The Pioneer Guards,
the City Guards, the St.Paul fire
department and numerous secret organizations would form in
procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of
representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the
nation's first great hero would take place.Business was generally
suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the
following day.In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St.She was
about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company.They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river
towns.Their concert took place in the hall of the house of
representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available
place at the time.Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud
by an incident that has never been printed.Two boys employed as
messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business
men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a
number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they
were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of
playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations
as it was possible for kids to conceive.After an hour or so of
revelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated.In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall
and an alarm of fire was sounded.The door leading to the house was
forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned
through the floor.The boys knew at once that it was their
carelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids
never got together.They could see visions of policemen, prison bars,
and even Stillwater, day and night for many years.They would often
get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they
had yet been suspected.For more than a quarter of a century these two
kids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts,
and it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible
predicament.*       *       *       *       *

A few days after Maj.Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and
Stripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of
party, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives
for the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the
dastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government.Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was
packed and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of
the building in order that all who desired might take part in the
proceedings.John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided,
assisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents.John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the
principal speakers.Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for
congress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested
to hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict.Gilman was in hearty sympathy with
the object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great
demonstrations of approbation.Gilman
and made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr.There
were a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted
pledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling
on the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly
forming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid
when necessary to the dependant families of those left behind.Similar
meetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times
before the Rebellion was subdued.*       *       *       *       *

The first Republican state convention after the state was admitted
into the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives.The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time
and Col.Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for
representatives in congress.Aldrich did not pretend to be much
of an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while
he was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his
associates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and
he promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to
promote the success of the ticket.*       *       *       *       *

Aromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built
in 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of
the war.The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of
the social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by
the Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day.The Pioneer Guards
disbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members
were officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole
away and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's
staff during the entire war.Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others
followed as the war progressed.*       *       *       *       *

It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St.Paul could boast of a
genuine opera house.The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street,
on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished
that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local
talent.The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at
auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who
paid $72 for a seat in the parquet.This man Philbrick was a visitor
in St.Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him.It
was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and
when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people
were sure that he was at least a duke.He disappeared as mysteriously
as he had appeared.It was learned afterward that this mysterious
person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark.The first regular company to
occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily
Melville as the chief attraction.Daniel moved to the bathroom.This little theater could seat about
1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long
before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed.Wendell
Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and
many others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old
opera house.An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was
in St.Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before
the lecture was to commence, and when Mr.Douglass commenced speaking
there was standing room only.A couple of enthusiastic Republicans
found standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in
front of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of
W.H.Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in
local Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous
swing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to
do was to swing around with him.Consequently the Republicans who
stood up behind Mr.Shelley thought they would have a little amusement
at his expense.Douglass made a point worthy
of applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great
demonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could
only see the huge outline of Mr.Shelley they concluded that he was
thoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the
Republican fold.Shelley stood it until the lecture was about
half over, when he left the opera house in disgust.Shelley was a
candidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St.Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson,
but as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked
confirmation.*       *       *       *       *

About the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England
a number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the
Athenaeum.There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at
that time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as
possible.James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the
Benecia boy.They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all
the attendants necessary for properly staging the melee.It was
prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock
Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and
Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged
plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out.And Hill has kept
right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,
and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty
years ago.PRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.SHELLEY THE PIONEER PRINTER OF MINNESOTA--A LARGE NUMBER OF

John C. Devereux, Barrett Smith, J.B.H.Mitchell, David Ramaley, M.R.Prendergast, Jacob T. McCoy, A.S.Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer
editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to
the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed
by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of
people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, "the man behind
the gun," received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of
our early history.In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in
St.Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few
fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the
new territory of Minnesota.Accompanying him were two young printers,
named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot
on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the
great Northwest.These two young men quickly tired of their isolation
and returned to their former home.They were soon followed by another
young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains
of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his
country's honor.Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,
on the 25th of September, 1827.When a mere lad he removed to
Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on
the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule
and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to
take part in the campaign against the Mexicans.He was assigned to
the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of
hostilities.On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered
to report to Gen.Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across
the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista
followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces
were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third
dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special
mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position
against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the
leadership of Santa Ana.Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa
Ana withdrew from Gen.Taylor's front and retreated toward the City
of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the
American forces under the command of Gen.Peace was declared in
1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.Louis, where they were mustered out of the service.Shelly took
passage in a steamer for St.Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,
being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota.The
Pioneer was the first paper printed in St.Paul, but the Register and
Chronicle soon followed.Shelly's first engagement was in the
office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was
employed by Mr.Goodhue at the time of his tragic death.Shelly was connected
with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat
consolidated.Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and
when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the
old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with
Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's
battalion.Mary travelled to the hallway.Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they
were mustered into service in September, 1861.They were ordered to
report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known
as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry.In
February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and
arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and
surrender of Fort Donelson.Brackett's battalion was the only
Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were
not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and
exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.Buckner from receiving
reinforcements.Sandra went back to the hallway.After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual
scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and
the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them.From Fort Donelson
three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being
Capt.Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.Beauregard, who was only a short distance away.Brackett's company was
sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the
roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen.Buell to arrive at Pittsburg
Landing just in time to save Gen.Shelly's company was engaged in
protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,
Miss.On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the
rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief.This attack of the
rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,
1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort
Donelson.They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their
dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt.Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in
scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes
on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle.They
were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept
themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes.Opposed to
them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry
officers in the Confederate service.A number of severe actions ended
in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a
prominent part.After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept
on duty on the dividing line between the two forces.About the 1st
of January, 1864, most of Capt.Shelly's company reinlisted and they
returned home on a thirty days' furlough.After receiving a number
of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,
received orders to report to Gen.M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next
directed to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a
state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the
responsibility alone.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the
dying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned
beforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed
the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise
of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,
which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last
mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said
authoritatively to the municipal on duty, "If you will not take these
bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our
carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to
take charge of him."The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken
as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come
nearer."Speak lower, I beg of you," said he; "I am afraid they will hear
you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,
as it would give them much uneasiness."At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and
gave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.
Pelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a
colleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made
his appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the
official despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They
repaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard
that the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,
which had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about
nine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they
perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out
by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to
soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the
Prince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him."My dear
mother remains in the other tower."Night came,--his last night,--which
the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,
with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,
death, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room
on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and
mute:

"I hope you are not in pain just now?""Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so
beautiful!"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, "From what direction do you hear this
music?"And the
child, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his
large eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy
this last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,
in intense rapture, "Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of
my mother!"At a quarter past two he died, Lasne
only being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,
the commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber
of death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into
that where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never
ceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the
scaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains
were laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set
open,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had
seized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of
general safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really
dead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont
they affected the greatest indifference."The event is not of the least
importance," they repeated, several times over; "the police commissary of
the section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will
acknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the
committee will give the necessary directions."As they withdrew, some
officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass
without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those
coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child's
death.All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them
if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of
France.Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the
Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis
XVII.When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the
minutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.These minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was
afterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the
outer gate of the Temple.These were Dumangin, head physician of the
Hospice de l'Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de
l'Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and
Laasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.The
last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former
connection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with
the House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the
National Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the
minutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up
again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis
XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.
Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little
favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries
prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse
was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,
and that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the
longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy
and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took
place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before
the gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the
coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;
but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the
arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the
procession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing
round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured
ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.Compassion and sorrow were
impressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,
sent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,
still covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of
four men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or
eight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long
way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the
cemetery.The name of "Little Capet," and the more popular title of
Dauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as
some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment
was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet
from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,
which subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound
marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!Not
till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,
and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of
interment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for
whom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's
death the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed
to walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of
the old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several
times evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths
of her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had
much difficulty in expressing her feelings."She spoke so confusedly,"
says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, "that it was
difficult to understand her.It took her more than a month's reading
aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself
intelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression."She was
dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured
by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed
to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave
off.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with
a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not
like to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered
herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and
ascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great
changes about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded
for the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to
pray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed
this example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a
condition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be
allowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that
Madame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and
ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,
Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th
December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from
prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting
public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the
Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made
it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her
brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the
frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of
France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named
Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale
reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds
were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.
