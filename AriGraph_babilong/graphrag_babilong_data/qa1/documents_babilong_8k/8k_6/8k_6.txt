You have made
a famous start, and everything will go well, believe me.”

Then he went out, and the shrill clamor of the bell hung to jangle
when the door was opened woke Jessica from her day-dream, just as the
sunbeams had begun to drive away the night.She rose with a start, and walked to the door to follow his
retiring figure through the glass.She stood there, lost in another
revery--vague, languorous, half-bright, half-hideous--until the door
from the back room was opened, and Samantha’s sharp voice fell on the
silence of the little shop.“I ain’t going to set in that poky old kitchen any longer for all
the bonnets in your whole place,” she remarked, with determination,
advancing to the mirror with the toque on her truculently poised head.“Besides, you said you’d call us when they were all gone.”

Lucinda stole up to her sister-employer, and murmured in a side-long
whisper: “I couldn’t keep her from listening a little.She heard what you said about that Boyce chap.”

The tidings angered Jessica even more than they alarmed her.With an
impulse equally illogical and natural, she frowned at Samantha, and
stiffened her fingers claw-wise, with a distinct itching to tear that
arrangement of bronze velvet and sage-green feathers from her perfidious
sister’s head.Curiously enough, it was the usually aggressive Lucinda who counselled
prudence.“If I was you, I’d ask her to stay to dinner,” she said,
in the same furtive undertone.“I’ve been talking to her, and I guess
she’ll be all right if we make it kind o’ pleasant for her when she
comes.But if you rub her the wrong way, she’ll scratch.”

Samantha was asked to dinner, and stayed, and later, being offered her
choice of three hat-pins with heads of ornamented jet, took two.*****

Reuben walked slowly back to the office, and then sat through a solitary
meal at a side-table in the Dearborn House dining-room, although his
customary seat was at the long table down the centre, in order that he
might think over what he had heard.It is not clear that the isolated fact disclosed to him in the
milliner’s shop would, in itself, have been sufficient to awaken in his
mind any serious distrust of his partner.As the sexes have different
trainings and different spheres, so they have different standards.Men
set up the bars, for instance, against a brother who cheats at cards, or
divulges what he has heard in his club, or borrows money which he cannot
repay, or pockets cigars at feasts when he does not himself smoke.But
their courts of ethics do not exercise jurisdiction over sentimental or
sexual offences, as a rule.Mary moved to the bedroom.These the male instinct vaguely refers to
some other tribunal, which may or may not be in session somewhere else.And this male instinct is not necessarily co-existent with immoral
tendencies, or blunted sensibilities, or even indifference: it is the
man’s way of looking at it--just as it is his way to cross a muddy
street on his toes, while his sisters perform the same feat on their
heels.Reuben Tracy was a good man, and one with keen aspirations toward
honorable and ennobling things; but still he was a man, and it may
be that this discovery, standing by itself, would not seriously have
affected his opinion of Horace.In an indefinite kind of way, he was conscious of being less attracted
by the wit and sparkling smalltalk of Horace than he had been at first.Somehow, the young man seemed to have exhausted his store; he began to
repeat himself, as if he had already made the circuit of the small ring
around which his mind travelled.Reuben confronted a suspicion that the
Boyce soil was shallow.This might not be necessarily an evil thing, he said to himself.Lawyers
quite often achieved notable successes before juries, who were not
deep or well-grounded men.Horace was versatile, and versatility was
a quality which Reuben distinctly lacked.From that point of view the
combination ought, therefore, to be of value.Versatility of that variety was not so
admirable.Reuben could count
on his fingers now six separate falsehoods that his partner had already
told him.They happened not to be upon vital or even important subjects,
but that did not render them the more palatable.He knew from other sources
that Horace had been intrusted with the papers left to Mr.Clarke’s
executors.The young man had taken them to his father’s house, and had
never mentioned so much as a syllable about them to his partner.No
doubt, Horace felt that he ought to have this as his personal business,
and upon the precedent Reuben himself had set with the railroad work,
this was fair enough.But there was something underhanded in his secrecy
about the matter.Reuben’s thoughts from this drifted to the Minsters themselves, and
centred reverently upon the luminous figure of that elder daughter
whom he had met an hour before.He did not dwell much upon her
beauty--perhaps he was a trifle dull about such things--but her
graciousness, her sweet interest in the charity, her womanly commingling
of softness and enthusiasm, seemed to shine about him as he mused.Thessaly unconsciously assumed a brighter and more wholesome aspect,
with much less need of reform than before, in his mind’s eye, now that
he thought of it as her home.The prosperous and respected lawyer was still a country boy
in his unformed speculations as to what that home might be like.The
Minster house was the most splendid mansion in Dearborn County, it was
said, but his experience with mansions was small.A hundred times it had
been said to him that he could go anywhere if he liked, and he gave the
statement credence enough.But somehow it happened that he had not gone.To “be in society,” as the phrase went, had not seemed important to him.Now, almost for the first time, he found himself regretting this.Then
he smiled somewhat scowlingly at his plate as the vagrant reflection
came up that his partner contributed social status as well as
versatility and mendacity to the outfit of the firm.Horace Boyce had a
swallowtail coat, and visited at the Minsters’.The reflection was not
altogether grateful to him.Reuben rose from the table, and stood for a few moments by the window
overlooking the veranda and the side street.The sunny warmth of the
thawing noon-day had made it possible to have the window open, and the
sound of voices close at hand showed that there were people already
anticipating pneumonia and the springtime by sitting on the porch
outside.These voices conveyed no distinct impression at first to Reuben’s mind,
busy as he was with his own reflections.But all at once there was a
scraping of feet and chair-legs on the floor, signifying that the party
had risen, and then he heard two remarks which made a sharp appeal to
his attention and interest.The first voice said: “Mind, I’m not going to let you put me into a
hole.What I do, I do only when it has been proved to me to be to my
own interest, and not at all because I’m afraid of you.Understand that
clearly!”

The other voice replied: “All that you need be afraid of is that you
will kick over your own bucket of milk.You’ve got the whole game in
your hands, if you only listen to me and don’t play it like a fool.Shall we go up to your house and put the thing into shape?We can be alone there.”

The voices ceased, and there was a sound of footsteps descending from
the porch to the sidewalk.The two men passed before the window,
ducking their heads for protection against the water dripping from the
overflowed eaves on the roof of the veranda, and thus missing sight of
the man who had overheard them.Reuben had known at once by the sound of the voice that the first
speaker was Horace Boyce.He recognized his companion now as Schuyler
Tenney, and the sight startled him.Just why it should have done so, he could not have explained.He had
seen this Schuyler Tenney almost every day for a good many years,
putting them all together, and had never before been troubled, much less
alarmed, by the spectacle.But coming now upon what Jessica had
told him, and what his own thoughts had evolved, and what he had
inadvertently overheard, the figure of the rising hardware merchant
loomed darkly in his perturbed fancy as an evil and threatening thing.A rustic client with a grievance sought Tracy out in the seclusion
of the dining-room, and dragged him back to his office and into the
intricacies of the law of trespass; but though he did his best to listen
and understand, the farmer went away feeling that his lawyer was a
considerably overrated man.For, strive as he might, Reuben could not get the sound of those words,
“you’ve got the whole game in your hands,” out of his ears, or restrain
his mind from wearying itself with the anxious puzzle of guessing what
that game could be.CHAPTER XVIII.--A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.Schuyler Tenney had never before been afforded an opportunity of
studying a young gentleman of fashion and culture in the intimacy of
his private apartments, and he looked about Horace’s room with lively
curiosity and interest, when the two conspirators had entered the
General’s house, gone up-stairs, and shut doors behind them.“It looks like a ninety-nine-cent store, for all the world,” was his
comment when he had examined the bric-à-brac on the walls and mantels,
“hefted” a bronze trifle or two on the table, and taken a comprehensive
survey of the furniture and hangings.“It’s rather bare than otherwise,” said Horace, carelessly.“I got
a tolerably decent lot of traps together when I had rooms in Jermyn
Street, but I had to let most of them go when I pulled up stakes to come
home.”

“German Street?I suppose that is in Germany?”

“No--London.”

“Oh!Sold ’em because you got hard up?”

“Not at all.But this damned tariff of yours--or ours--makes it cost too
much to bring decent things over here.”

“Protection to American industry, my boy,” said Mr.“We
couldn’t get on a fortnight without it.Just think what--”

“Oh, hang it all, man!We didn’t come here to talk tariff!” Horace broke
in, with a smile which was half annoyance.“No, that’s so,” assented Mr.Tenney, settling himself in the low,
deep-backed easy-chair, and putting the tips of his lean fingers
together.“No, we didn’t, for a fact.” He added, after a moment’s pause:
“I guess I’ll have to rig up a room like this myself, when the thing
comes off.” He smiled icily to himself at the thought.“Meanwhile, let us talk about the ‘thing,’ as you call it.Will you have
a drink?”

“Never touch it,” said Mr.Tenney, and he looked curiously on while
Horace poured out some brandy, and then opened a bottle of soda-water to
go with it.He was particularly impressed by the little wire frame-work
stand made to hold the round-bottomed bottle, and asked its cost, and
wondered if they wouldn’t be a good thing to keep in the store.“Now to business!” said Horace, dragging out from under a sofa the black
tin box which held the Minster papers, and throwing back its cover.“I’ve told you pretty well what there is in here.”

Mr.Mary journeyed to the kitchen.Tenney took from his pocket-book the tabular statement Horace had
made of the Minster property, and smoothed it out over his pointed knee.“It’s a very pretty table,” he said; “no bookkeeper could have done it
better.I know it by heart, but we’ll keep it here in sight while you
proceed.”

“There’s nothing for me to proceed with,” said Horace, lolling back
in his chair in turn.“I want to hear _you!_ Don’t let us waste time.Broadly, what do you propose?”

“Broadly, what does everybody propose?To get for himself what somebody
else has got.It’s every kind of nature, down to
the little chickens just hatched who start to chase the chap with the
worm in his mouth before they’ve fairly got their tails out of the
shell.”

“You ought to write a book, Schuyler,” said Horace, using this
familiar name for the first time: “‘Tenney on Dynamic Sociology’!What particular worm have you got in your
bill’s eye?”

“We are all worms, so the Bible says.I suppose even those scrumptious
ladies there come under that head, like we ordinary mortals.” Mr.Tenney
pointed his agreeable metaphor by touching the paper on his knee with
his joined finger-tips, and showed his small, sharpened teeth in a
momentary smile.“I follow you,” said Horace, tentatively.“Go on!”

“That’s a heap of money that you’ve ciphered out there, on that paper.”

“Yes.True, it isn’t ours, and we’ve got nothing to do with it.Go on!”

“A good deal of it can be ours, if you’ve got the pluck to go in with
me.”

Horace frowned.“Upon my word, Tenney,” he said, impatiently, “what do
you mean?”

“Jest what I said,” was the sententious and collected response.The younger man laughed with an uneasy assumption of scorn.“Is it
a burglary you do me the honor to propose, or only common or garden
robbery?Ought we to manage a little murder in the thing, or what do you
say to arson?Upon my word, man, I believe that you don’t realize that
what you’ve said is an insult!”

“No, I don’t.You’re right there,” said the hardware merchant, in no
wise ruffled.“But I do realize that you come pretty near being the
dod-blamedest fool in Dearborn County.”

“Much obliged for the qualification, I’m sure,” retorted Horace, who
felt the mists of his half-simulated, half-instinctive anger fading away
before the steady breath of the other man’s purpose.Mary moved to the office.Pray go on.”

“There ain’t no question of dishonesty about the thing, not the
slightest.I ain’t that kind of a man!” Horace permitted himself a
shadowy smile, emphasized by a subdued little sniff, which Tenney caught
and was pleased to appear to resent, “Thessaly knows me!” he said, with
an air of pride.“They ain’t a living man--nor a dead one nuther--can
put his finger on me.I’ve lived aboveboard, sir, and owe no man a red
cent, and I defy anybody to so much as whisper a word about my
character.”

“‘Tenney on Faith Justified by Works,’” commented Horace, softly,
smiling as much as he dared, but in a less aggressive manner.“Works--yes!” said the hardware merchant, “the Minster iron-works, in
particular.” He seemed pleased with his little joke, and paused to dwell
upon it in his mind for an instant.Then he went on, sitting upright in
his chair now, and displaying a new earnestness:

“Dishonesty is wrong, and it is foolish.It gets a man disgraced, and
it gets him in jail.A smart
man can get money in a good many ways without giving anybody a chance
to call him dishonest.I have thought out several plans--some of
them strong at one point, others at another, but all pretty middlin’
good--how to feather our own nests out of this thing.”

“Well?” said Horace, interrogatively.Tenney did not smile any more, and he had done with digressions.“First of all,” he said, with his intent gray eyes fixed on the young
man’s face, “what guarantee have I that you won’t give me away?”

“What guarantee _can_ I give you?” replied Horace, also sitting up.“Perhaps you are right,” said Tenney, thinking in his own swift-working
mind that it would be easy enough to take care of this poor creature
later on.“Well, then, you’ve been appointed Mrs.Minster’s lawyer in
the interest of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company--this company
here marked ‘D,’ in which the family has one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.”

“I gathered as much.Perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me what it is all
about.”

“I’m as transparent as plate-glass when I think a man is acting square
with me,” said the hardware merchant.Wendover and
me got hold of a little rolling-mill and nail-works at Cadmus, down on
the Southern Tier, a few years ago.Some silly people had put up the
money for it, and there was a sort of half-crazy inventor fellow running
it.They were making ducks and drakes of the whole thing, and I saw
a chance of getting into the concern--I used to buy a good deal of
hardware from them, and knew how they stood--and I spoke to Wendover,
and so we went in.”

“That means that the other people were put out, I suppose,” commented
Horace.“Well, no; but they kind o’ faded away like.I wouldn’t exactly say they
were put out, but after a while they didn’t seem to be able to stay in.The iron fields
around there had pretty well petered out, and we were way off the main
line of transportation.Business was fair enough; we made a straight ten
per cent, year in and year out, because the thing was managed carefully;
but that was in spite of a lot of drawbacks.So I got a scheme in my
head to move the whole concern up here to Thessaly, and hitch it up with
the Minster iron-works.We could save one dollar a ton, or forty-five
thousand dollars in all, in the mere matter of freight alone, if we
could use up their entire output.I may tell you, I didn’t appear in the
business at all.Minster don’t know to this day that I’m
a kind of partner of hers.It happened that Wendover used to know her
when she was a girl--they both come from down the Hudson somewhere--and
so he worked the thing with her, and we moved over from Cadmus, hook,
line, bob, and sinker, and we’re the Thessaly Manufacturing Company.Do
you see?”

“So far, yes.She and her daughters have one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars cash in it.What is the rest of the company like?”

“It’s stocked at four hundred thousand dollars.We put in all our plant
and machinery and business and good-will and so on at one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and then we furnished seventy-five thousand
dollars cash.So we hold two hundred and twenty-five shares to their one
hundred and seventy-five.”

“Who are the ‘we’?”

“Well, Pete Wendover and me are about the only people you’re liable to
meet around the premises, I guess.There are some other names on the
books, but they don’t amount to much.We can wipe them off whenever we
like.”

“I notice that this company has paid no dividends since it was formed.”

“That’s because of the expense of building.And we ain’t got what you
may call fairly to work yet.There is big money in
it.”

“I daresay,” observed Horace.“But, if you will excuse the remark, I
seem to have missed that part of your statement which referred to _my_
making something out of the company.”

The hardware merchant allowed his cold eyes to twinkle for an instant.“You’ll be taken care of,” he said, confidentially.“Don’t fret your
gizzard about _that!_”

Horace smiled.It seemed to be easier to get on with Tenney than he had
thought.“But what am I to do; that is, if I decide to do anything?” he
asked.“I confess I don’t see your scheme.”

“Why, that’s curious,” said the other, with an air of candor.“And you
lawyers have the name of being so ’cute, too!”

“I don’t suppose we see through a stone wall much farther than other
people.Our chief advantage is in being able to recognize that it is a
wall.And this one of yours seems to be as thick and opaque as most, I’m
bound to say.”

“We don’t want you to do anything, just now,” Mr.“Things may turn up in which you can be of assistance, and then we want
to count on you, that’s all.”

This was a far less lucid explanation than Horace had looked for.Tenney
had been so anxious for a confidential talk, and had hinted of such
dazzling secrets, that this was a distinct disappointment.“What did you mean by saying that I had the whole game in my hands?”
 he demanded, not dissembling his annoyance.“Thus far, you haven’t even
dealt me any cards!”

Mr.Tenney lay back in his chair again, and surveyed Horace over his
finger-tips.“There is to be a game, young man, and you’ve been put in
a position to play in it when the time comes.But I should be a
particularly simple kind of goose to tell you about it beforehand; now,
wouldn’t I?”

Thus candidly appealed to, Horace could not but admit that his
companion’s caution was defensible.“Please yourself,” he said.“I daresay you’re right enough.I’ve got the
position, as you say.Sandra moved to the office.Perhaps it is through you that it came to me; I’ll
concede that, for argument’s sake.You are not a man who expects people
to act from gratitude alone.Therefore you don’t count upon my doing
things for you in this position, even though you put me there, unless
you first convince me that they will also benefit me.That is clear
enough, isn’t it?When the occasion
arises that you need me, you can tell me what it is, and what I am to
get out of it, and then we’ll talk business.”

Mr.Tenney had not lifted his eyes for a moment from his companion’s
face.John went back to the bathroom.Had his own countenance been one on which inner feelings were
easily reflected, it would just now have worn an expression of amused
contempt.“Well, this much I might as well tell you straight off,” he said.“A
part of my notion, if everything goes smoothly, is to have Mrs.Minster
put you into the Thessaly Manufacturing Company as her representative
and to pay you five thousand dollars a year for it, which might be fixed
so as to stand separate from the other work you do for her.Wendover
can arrange that with her.And then I am counting now on declaring
myself up at the Minster works, and putting in my time up there; so that
your father will be needed again in the store, and it might be so that
I could double his salary, and let him have back say a half interest
in the business, and put him on his feet.I say these things _might_ be
done.I don’t say I’ve settled on them, mind!”

“And you still think it best to keep me in the dark; not to tell me what
it is I’m to do?” Horace leant forward, and asked this question eagerly.“No-o--I’ll tell you this much.Your business will be to say ditto to
whatever me and Wendover say.”

A full minute’s pause ensued, during which Mr.Tenney gravely watched
Horace sip what remained of his drink.Do you go in with us?” he asked, at last.“I’d better think it over,” said Horace.“Give me, say, till
Monday--that’s five days.And of course, if I do say yes, it will
be understood that I am not to be bound to do anything of a shady
character.”

“Certainly; but you needn’t worry about that,” answered Tenney.“Everything will be as straight as a die.There will be nothing but a
simple business transaction.”

“What did you mean by saying that we should take some of the Minster
money away?That had a queer sound.”

“All business consists in getting other people’s money,” said the
hardware merchant, sententiously.John went back to the garden.“Where do you suppose Steve Minster
got his millions?Didn’t every dollar
pass through some other fellow’s pocket before it reached his?The
only difference was that when it got into his pocket it stuck there.Everybody is looking out to get rich; and when a man succeeds, it only
means that somebody else has got poor.That’s plain common-sense!”

The conversation practically ended here.Tenney devoted some quarter
of an hour to going severally over all the papers in the Minster box,
but glancing through only those few which referred to the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company.The proceeding seemed to Horace to be irregular,
but he could not well refuse, and Tenney was not interrupted.When
he had finished his task he shook hands with Horace with a novel
cordiality, and it was not difficult to guess that the result of his
search had pleased him.“You are sure those are all the papers Clarke left to be turned over?”
 he asked.Upon being assured in the affirmative his eyes emitted a
glance which was like a flash of light, and his lip lifted in a smile of
obvious elation.“There’s a fortune for both of us,” he said, jubilantly, as he unlocked
the door, and shook hands again.When he had gone, Horace poured out another drink and sat down to
meditate.CHAPTER XIX.--NO MESSAGE FOR MAMMA.Four days of anxious meditation did not help Horace Boyce to clear his
mind, and on the fifth he determined upon a somewhat desperate step, in
the hope that its issue would assist decision.Two ways of acquiring a
fortune lay before him.One was to marry Kate Minster; the other was
to join the plot against her property and that of her family, which the
subtile Tenney was darkly shaping.The misery of the situation was that he must decide at once which of
the ways he would choose.In his elation at being selected as the legal
adviser and agent of these millionnaire women, no such contingency as
this had been foreseen.He had assumed that abundant time would be at
his disposal, and he had said to himself that with time all things may
be accomplished with all women.But this precious element of time had been harshly cut out of his plans,
here at the very start.The few days reluctantly granted him had gone
by, one by one, with cruel swiftness, and to-morrow would be Monday--and
still his mind was not made up.If he could be assured that Miss Minster would marry him, or at least
admit him to the vantage-ground of _quasi-recognition_ as a suitor, the
difficulty would be solved at once.He would turn around and defend
her and her people against the machinations of Tenney.Just what the
machinations were he could not for the life of him puzzle out, but he
felt sure that, whatever their nature, he could defeat them, if only
he were given the right to do battle in the name of the family, as a
prospective member of it.On the other hand, it might be that he had no present chance with Miss
Minster as an eligible husband.What would happen if he relied on a
prospect which turned out not to exist?His own opportunity to share
in the profits of Tenney’s plan would be abruptly extinguished, and his
father would be thrown upon the world as a discredited bankrupt.Daniel moved to the hallway.Sometimes the distracted young man thought he caught glimpses of a safe
middle course.In these sanguine moments it seemed feasible to give in
his adhesion to Tenney’s scheme, and go along with him for a certain
time, say until the intentions of the conspirators were revealed.Then
he might suddenly revolt, throw himself into a virtuous attitude, and
win credit and gratitude at the hands of the family by protecting them
from their enemies.Then the game would be in his own hands, and no
mistake!But there were other times when this course did not present so many
attractions to his mind--when it was borne in upon him that Tenney would
be a dangerous kind of man to betray.He had seen merciless and terrible
depths in the gray eyes of the hardware merchant--depths which somehow
suggested bones stripped clean of their flesh, sucked bare of their
marrow, at the bottom of a gloomy sea.In these seasons of doubt, which
came mostly in the early morning when he first awoke, the mere thought
of Tenney’s hatred made him shudder.It was as if Hugo’s devil-fish had
crawled into his dreams.So Sunday afternoon came and found the young man still perplexed and
harassed.To do him justice, he had once or twice dwelt momentarily on
the plan of simply defying Tenney and doing his duty by the Minsters,
and taking his chances.The
case was too complicated for mere honesty.The days of martyrdom were
long since past.One needed to be smarter than one’s neighbors in these
later times.To eat others was the rule now, if one would save himself
from being devoured.It was at least clear to his mind that he must be
smart, and play his hand so as to get the odd trick even if honors were
held against him.Horace decided finally that the wisest thing he could do would be to
call upon the Minsters before nightfall, and trust to luck for some
opportunity of discovering Miss Kate’s state of mind toward him.He
was troubled more or less by fears that Sunday might not be regarded
in Thessaly as a proper day for calls, as he dressed himself for
the adventure.But when he got upon the street, the fresh air and
exhilaration oc exercise helped to reassure him.Before he reached the
Minster gate he had even grown to feel that the ladies had probably had
a dull day of it, and would welcome his advent as a diversion.John went to the kitchen.He was shown into the stately parlor to the left of the wide hall--a
room he had not seen before--and left to sit there in solitude for some
minutes.This term of waiting he employed in looking over the portraits
on the wall and the photographs on the mantels and tables.Aside from
several pictures of the dissipated Minster boy who had died, he could
see no faces of young men anywhere, and he felt this to be a good sign
as he tiptoed his way back to his seat by the window.Fortune smiled at least upon the opening of his enterprise.It was Miss
Kate who came at last to receive him, and she came alone.The young
