"I wonder--if I could develop into the right sort."Daniel moved to the bedroom."May I come and see what you have done--and talk it over?"Sandra went to the garden."Since this friend of mine took it up, I'm ever so interested in camera
work."She had never thought of her camera
holding such possibilities within it, of its growing into something
better and more satisfying than a mere playmate of the moment.Supper was served on the lawn; the pleasantest, most informal, of
affairs, the presence of the older members of the party serving to turn
the gay give and take of the young folks into deeper and wider
channels, and Shirley's frequent though involuntary--"Do you remember,
Senior?"calling out more than one vivid bit of travel, of description
of places, known to most of them only through books.Later, down on the lower end of the lawn, with the moon making a path

folk-songs, picked up in her rambles with her father.Afterwards, the

smile,' wouldn't they?"Patience had been a model of behavior all the evening.John went to the bathroom.Mother would be
sure to ask if she had been good, when they got home.That was one of
those aggravating questions that only time could relieve her from.No
one ever asked Paul, or Hilary, that--when they'd been anywhere.John travelled to the kitchen.Dayre had promised, the party broke up early, going off in the
various rigs they had come in.John went to the bathroom.Tom and Josie went in the trap with the
Shaws."It's been perfectly lovely--all of it," Josie said, looking
back along the road they were leaving."Every good time we have seems
