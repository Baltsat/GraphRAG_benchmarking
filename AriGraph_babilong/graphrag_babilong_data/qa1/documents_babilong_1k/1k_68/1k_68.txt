Maspero, in his work on Egyptian archæology, translated by Miss
Amelia B. Edwards[59] devotes a chapter to the description of the
existing remains of private dwellings and military architecture.The
examples of the former are of comparatively small buildings, and were
invariably built in crude or unburnt brick; in the neighbourhood of
Memphis Mr.Maspero found walls still standing, from 30 to 40 ft.The plans which are delineated on the walls of the tombs of the
18th dynasty enable us to judge of the extent and magnificence of the
more important examples.These as a rule would seem to have features
which are evidently derived from temple architecture, that is to say,
the palaces are preceded by pylons and the courts enclosed and
surrounded with porticoes.Of military architecture the oldest
fortresses are those at Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh; at Abydos the
earliest example consists of a parallelogram of crude brickwork
measuring 410 ft.The walls, which now stand from 24 to 36
ft.John journeyed to the bathroom.high, have lost somewhat of their original height: they are about 6
ft.thick at the top and were not built in uniform layers, but in huge
vertical panels easily distinguished by the nature of the brickwork.In
one division the course of the bricks is strictly horizontal, in the
next it is slightly concave, and forms a very flat reversed arch, of
which the extrados rests on the ground.The alternation of these two
methods is regularly repeated.The object of this arrangement was
possibly to resist earthquake shocks.Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.View of Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.]No building can form a greater contrast with the temple behind it than
does the little pavilion erected at Medeenet Habû by Rameses, the first
king of the 19th dynasty.As will be seen by the annexed plan (Woodcut
No.34), it is singularly broken and varied in its outline, surrounding
a small court in the shape of a cross.It is 3 storeys in height, and,
properly speaking, consists of only 3 rooms on each floor, connected
together by long winding passages.Sandra went back to the garden.There is reason, however, to believe
that this is only a fragment of the building, and foundations exist
which render it probable that the whole was originally a square of the
width of the front, and had other chambers, probably only in wood or
brick, besides those we now find.This would hardly detract from the
playful character of the design, and when, as it originally
was, and with its battlements or ornaments complete, it must have formed
a composition as pleasing as it is unlike our usual conceptions of
Egyptian art.The other illustration represents in the Egyptians’ own quaint style a
three-storeyed dwelling, the upper storey apparently being, like those
of the Assyrians, an open gallery supported by dwarf columns.The lower
windows are closed by shutters.In the centre is a staircase leading to
the upper storeyJohn went to the bedroom.Sandra moved to the bathroom.
