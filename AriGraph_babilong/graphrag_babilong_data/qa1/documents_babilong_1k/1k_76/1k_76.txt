And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,

explanations where they had been, what they were doing, where they were
going.Lord Beaumanoir told Coningsby he had introduced steeple-chases
at Rome, and had parted with Sunbeam to the nephew of a Cardinal.Coningsby securing Edith's hand for the next dance, they all moved on
together to her aunt.Lady Wallinger was indulging in some Roman reminiscences with the
Marquess.'And you are not going to Astrachan to-morrow?''Not to-morrow,' said Coningsby.'You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to
permit travel to a man?''I wish nothing was stirring,' said Coningsby.All that I wish is, that this fete should never end.''Is it possible that you can be capricious?'Am I capricious because I dislike change?''It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the Desert,' said
Coningsby.Soon after this Coningsby led Edith to the dance.It was at a ball that
he had first met her at Paris, and this led to other reminiscences;
all most interesting.All mysteries, all
difficulties, were driven from his recollection; he lived only in the
exciting and enjoyable present.Some time after this, Coningsby, who was inevitably separated from
Edith, met his host.'Where have you been, child,' said Sidonia, 'that I have not seen you
for some days?Daniel travelled to the garden.'And I must think, I suppose, of Cambridge.'Daniel went to the bathroom.'Well, you have seen something; you will find it more profitable when
