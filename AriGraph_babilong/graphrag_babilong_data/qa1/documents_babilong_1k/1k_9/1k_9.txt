cried Mandy, reining up her pony."What a ranch
that would make, Allan!Why did we never come this way
before?""Piegan Reserve," said her husband briefly."They gave up a lot for it," said Cameron drily.Sandra went to the garden."But think, such a lovely bit of country for a few Indians!They're
over-fond of cattle to be really desirable neighbors.""Well, I think it rather a pity!"cried her husband, sweeping his arm toward the eastern
horizon.From the height on which they stood a wonderful panorama of
hill and valley, river, lake and plain lay spread out before them."All
that and for nine hundred miles beyond that line these Indians and their
kin gave up to us under persuasion.For a mile or more the trail ran along the high plateau skirting the
Piegan Reserve, where it branched sharply to the right.pointing to the branch that led to the left and
downward into the valley."That is one of the oldest and most famous
of all Indian trails.It strikes down through the Crow's Nest Pass and
beyond the pass joins the ancient Sun Dance Trail.And weird things are a-doing along that same old Sun Dance Trail this
blessed minute or I miss my guess.I venture to say that this old trail
has often been marked with blood from end to end in the fierce old
days.""Let's go," said Mandy, with a shudder, and, turning her pony to the
right, she took the trail that led them down from the plateau, plunged
into a valley, wound among rocks and thickets of pine till it reached a
tumbling mountain torrent of gray-blue water, fed from glaciers high up
between the great peaks beyond.Down by its rushing water they scrambled till they came to a sunny glade
where the little fretful torrent pitched itself headlong into a deep
shady pool, whence, as if rested in those quiet deeps, it issued at
first with gentle murmuring till, out of earshot of the pool, it broke
again into turbulent raging, brawling its way to the Big Horn below.Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Mandy could hardly wait for the unloading and tethering of the ponies."Now," she cried, when all was ready, "for my very first fish.How shall
I fling this hook and where?""Try a cast yonder, just beside that overhanging willow.Don't tell me you've never
cast a fly before."With a shout he sprang to
his wife's side."By Jove, you've got him!"Reel him up--reel him up a little.""Oh, I can't reel the thing!Don't haul him too quickly--keep him playing."They always are," said her husband gravely."The fellows that get off,
I mean.""Now you're just laughing at me, and I won't have it!"Never mind, Mandy, we'll get him or just as good a one again."They keep nibbling
till they get caught; else there would be no fun in fishing or in--Now
try another throw--same place--a little farther down.Flip
