Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,
and are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,
may not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise
them, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily
follows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be
seen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our
fingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by
experience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and
figure of its weight and wheels.Sandra travelled to the hallway.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not
exhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the
arteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart
dischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what
hath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must
be given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who
taught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of
the arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,
enters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self
back towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a
perpetuall circulation.Mary moved to the office.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary
experience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard
above the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to
issue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound."But I'll have
that sort for any children who may come.Hilary takes pictures--she
doesn't make them though.Harry glanced through the open doorway, to where
Hilary sat resting.She was "making" a picture now, he thought to
himself, in her white dress, under the big tree, her pretty hair
forming a frame about her thoughtful face.Taking a portfolio from a
table near by, he went out to where Hilary sat."Your small sister says you take pictures," he said, drawing a chair up
beside hers, "so I thought perhaps you'd let me show you these--they
were taken by a friend of mine.""Oh, but mine aren't anything like these!John went back to the kitchen.Hilary bent over the photographs he handed her; marveling over their
soft tones.John went to the office.They were mostly bits of landscape, with here and there a
water view and one or two fleecy cloud effects.It hardly seemed as
though they could be really photographs."I wish I
could--there are some beautiful views about here that would make
charming pictures.""She didn't in the beginning," Harry said, "She's lame; it was an
accident, but she can never be quite well again, so she took this up,
as an amusement at first, but now it's going to be her profession.""And you really think--anyone
could learn to do it?""No, not anyone; but I
