Mary travelled to the hallway."I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he
suggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the
abyss.John journeyed to the garden.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There's a dreadful fascination in it even now.Sandra went to the kitchen.I think I'd rather
go--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may
be weaker."John travelled to the bathroom.She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently
agitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,
ladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a
heightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved
