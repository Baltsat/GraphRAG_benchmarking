"I want cheerful company when
I'm like that.John went back to the garden.I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in
your beds.You don't 'arf know what I'm like.Last night was nothing,
else I should 'ave remembered it."'Ow do you think company's going to be
cheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?""Because I've got a 'art," ses Bill."I can't chuck up pals in that
free-and-easy way.Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for
'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.Three nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore.""Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?""No, mate," ses Bill, with a kind smile; "it's just a weakness, and I
must try and grow out of it.I'll tie a bit o' string round my little
finger to-night as a re-minder."He got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was
doing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet."All right, Bill, old man," he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to
put his clothes on; "but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the
landlord is."ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin.Mary went to the bedroom."Why, the one you bashed," ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two."He
'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away."Bill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger
told 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the
landlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.He began to
tremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land
lay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.He stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat
anything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out
whether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and
'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.Ginger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so
solemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.Ginger didn't
answer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking.Daniel went to the hallway."I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?"ses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice.John travelled to the bedroom."I didn't notice, mate," he ses.Then
'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.[Illustration: "Patted Bill on the back, very gentle."]asks Peter
