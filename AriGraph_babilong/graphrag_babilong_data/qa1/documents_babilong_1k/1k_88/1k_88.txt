"I hope it won't rain," the girl called back at him, "at least not till
we get over the divide.It's a fine ride up the hill, and the foliage is
at its best."It seemed to him the most glorious morning of his life.A few large white
clouds were drifting like snow-laden war-vessels from west to east,
silent and solemn, and on the highest peaks a gray vapor was lightly
clinging.Sandra moved to the hallway.Daniel went to the office.The near-by hills, still transcendently beautiful with the
flaming gold of the aspen, burned against the dark green of the farther
forest, and far beyond the deep purple of the shadowed <DW72>s rose to
smoky blue and tawny yellow.It was a season, an hour, to create raptures
