I intended to explain what Socialists understand by
the word 'poverty': to define the Socialist theory of the causes of
poverty, and to explain how Socialists propose to abolish poverty.It may be objected that, considering the number of books dealing with
these subjects already existing, such a work as this was uncalled for.Mary went back to the garden.The answer is that not only are the majority of people opposed to
Socialism, but a very brief conversation with an average anti-socialist
is sufficient to show that he does not know what Socialism means.The
same is true of all the anti-socialist writers and the 'great
statesmen' who make anti-socialist speeches: unless we believe that
they are deliberate liars and imposters, who to serve their own
interests labour to mislead other people, we must conclude that they do
not understand Socialism.There is no other possible explanation of
the extraordinary things they write and say.The thing they cry out
against is not Socialism but a phantom of their own imagining.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Another answer is that 'The Philanthropists' is not a treatise or
essay, but a novel.My main object was to write a readable story full
of human interest and based on the happenings of everyday life, the
subject of Socialism being treated incidentally.To what extent I have succeeded is for
others to say; but whatever their verdict, the work possesses at least
one merit--that of being true.There are no
scenes or incidents in the story that I have not either witnessed
myself or had conclusive evidence of.Mary went back to the bathroom.As far as I dared I let the
characters express themselves in their own sort of language and
consequently some passages may be considered objectionable.Mary went back to the bedroom.At the
same time I believe that--because it is true--the book is not without
its humorous side.The scenes and characters are typical of every town in the South of
England and they will be readily recognized by those concerned.If the
book is published I think it will appeal to a very large number of
readers.Because it is true it will probably be denounced as a libel
on the working classes and their employers, and upon the
religious-professing section of the community.But I believe it will be
acknowledged as true by most of those who are compelled to spend their
lives amid the surroundings it describes, and it will be evident that
no attack is made upon sincere religion.Britons Never shall be Slaves


The house was named 'The Cave'.It was a large old-fashioned
three-storied building standing in about an acre of ground, and
situated about a mile outside the town of Mugsborough.It stood back
nearly two hundred yards from the main road and was reached by means of
a by-road or lane, on each side of which was a hedge formed of hawthorn
trees and blackberry bushes.This house had been unoccupied for many
years and it was now being altered and renovated for its new owner by
the firm of Rushton & Co., Builders and Decorators.There were, altogether, about twenty-five men working there,
carpenters, plumbers,
