knew I might rely that your affection would do justice to poor heedless
Rothsay, who exposes himself to so much misconstruction that he scarcely
deserves the sentiments you feel for him."Sandra went to the office.Albany had such an immovable constancy of purpose, that he was able to
return the fraternal pressure of the King's hand, while tearing up by
the very roots the hopes of the indulgent, fond old man.Mary travelled to the garden.the Duke continued, with a sigh, "this burly, intractable
Knight of Kinfauns, and his brawling herd of burghers, will not view the
matter as we do.They have the boldness to say that this dead fellow had
been misused by Rothsay and his fellows, who were in the street in mask
and revel, stopping men and women, compelling them to dance, or to drink
huge quantities of wine, with other follies needless to recount; and
they say that the whole party repaired in Sir John Ramorny's, and broke

consequences, were more proper to the Prince than to Sir John, since
none suspects, far less believes, that that hopeful enterprise was
conducted for the gratification of the knight of Ramorny.""Thou drivest me mad, Robin!"Daniel moved to the hallway."I am dumb," answered his brother; "I did but speak my poor mind
according to your royal order."John travelled to the bedroom."Thou meanest well, I know," said the King; "but, instead of tearing me
to pieces with the display of inevitable calamities, were it not kinder,
Robin, to point me out some mode to escape from them?""True, my liege; but as the only road of extrication is rough and
difficult, it is necessary your Grace should be first possessed with
the absolute necessity of using it, ere you hear it even described.The
chirurgeon must first convince his patient of the incurable condition of
