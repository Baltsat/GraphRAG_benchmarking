John went back to the office.Astonished beyond measure at
what I had witnessed, and terrified almost to the verge of insanity, I
approached Summerfield, and tremblingly inquired, "To whom, sir, is this
tremendous secret known?"Mary moved to the bathroom."To myself alone," he responded; "and now
answer me a question: is it worth the money?"John journeyed to the hallway.*       *       *       *       *

It is entirely unnecessary to relate in detail the subsequent events
connected with this transaction.John went to the bathroom.I will only add a general statement,
showing the results of my negotiations.Having fully satisfied myself
that Summerfield actually held in his hands the fate of the whole world,
with its millions of human beings, and by experiment having tested the
combustion of sea-water, with equal facility as fresh, I next deemed it
my duty to call the attention of a few of the principal men in San
Francisco to the extreme importance of Summerfield's discovery.A leading banker, a bishop, a chemist, two State university professors,
a physician, a judge, and two Protestant divines, were selected by me to
witness the experiment on a large scale.Sandra went to the garden.Sandra went back to the office.This was done at a small
sand-hill lake, near the sea-shore, but separated from it by a ridge of
lofty mountains, distant not more than ten miles from San Francisco.Every single drop of water in the pool was burnt up in less than fifteen
minutes.We next did all that we could to pacify Summerfield, and
endeavored to induce him to lower his price and bring it within the
bounds of a reasonable possibility.He began to grow
urgent in his demands, and his brow would cloud like a tempest-ridden
sky whenever we approached him on the subject.Finally, ascertaining
that no persuasion could soften his heart or touch his feelings, a
sub-committee was appointed, to endeavor, if possible, to raise the
money by subscription.Before taking that step, however, we ascertained
beyond all question that Summerfield was the sole custodian of his dread
secret, and that he kept no written memorial of the formula of his
prescription.He even went so far as to offer us a penal bond that his
secret should perish with him in case we complied with his demands.The sub-committee soon commenced work amongst the wealthiest citizens of
San Francisco, and by appealing to the terrors of a few, and the
sympathies of all, succeeded in raising one half the amount within the
prescribed period.I shall never forget the woe-begone faces of
California Street during the month of October.The outside world and the
newspapers spoke most learnedly of a money panic--a pressure in
business, and the disturbances in the New York gold-room.But to the
initiated, there was an easier solution of the enigma.The pale spectre
of Death looked down upon them all, and pointed with its bony finger to
the fiery tomb of the whole race, already
