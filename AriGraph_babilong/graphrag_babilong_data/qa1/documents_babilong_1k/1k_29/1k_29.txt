Sandra went back to the kitchen.said the boy, speaking in an awestruck whisper, "speak not so
loud, friend!Daniel journeyed to the hallway.The sentinel recoiled, and stared in dismay at the dark bundle."His Celestial Majesty," replied Chop-Chin, "threw it in anger at his
Putter-on-of-Slippers yesterday, and broke one of its legs.All day my
master, the Chief Cabinet-maker, has been at work on it, and now he has
sent me with it by nightfall, that no profane eye may see clearly even
the outer covering of the sacred object."Mary went back to the bathroom."Pass in," said the sentinel, opening the gate.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom."But tell me, knowest
thou how it will fare with the Putter-on-of-Slippers?He is cousin to my
stepfather's aunt by marriage, and I would not that aught of ill should

Wah-Song got into bed, and was tucked in by the Finishing Toucher, who
got his nose well tweaked by way of thanks.Then the taper of perfumed
wax was lighted, and the shade of alabaster put over it, and then the
other lights were extinguished; and then the attendants all crawled out
backwards on their hands and knees, and shut the door after them; and
then His Celestial Majesty went to sleep.[Illustration: At last the Emperor began to dream.Sandra went to the hallway.Daniel journeyed to the garden.He heard an awful
