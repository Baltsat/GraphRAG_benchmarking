THE END OF SUMMER

It was Uncle Paul, and perhaps no one
was more surprised at his unexpected coming,
than he himself.That snap-shot of Hilary's had considerable
to do with it; bringing home to him the
sudden realization of the passing of the years.For the first time, he had allowed himself to
face the fact that it was some time now since
he had crossed the summit of the hill, and that

kind.But it is not the Spirit of the Age.''The age does not believe in great men, because it does not possess
any,' replied the stranger.'The Spirit of the Age is the very thing
that a great man changes.''But does he not rather avail himself of it?''Parvenus do,' rejoined his companion; 'but not prophets, great
legislators, great conquerors.'But are these times for great legislators and great conquerors?''From the throne to
