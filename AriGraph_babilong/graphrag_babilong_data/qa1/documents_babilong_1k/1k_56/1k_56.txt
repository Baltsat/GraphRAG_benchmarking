But he felt that if
he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his
usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him.He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had
completed the inquiries he had instituted.Sandra went to the hallway.In view of the 'lamentable
want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the
Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself
if he left his inquiry incomplete.'A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under
ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a
proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation,
and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to
Canadian public opinion.Mary travelled to the office.It was this proclamation which drew down on
him from _The Times_ the nickname of 'Lord High Seditioner.'Sandra moved to the bathroom.The
wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended
by Charles Duller.The general unpopularity of the British government,
Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could
not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the
angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with
whom they could agree.But this tendency to ill timed
mirth, which savoured of the rudeness of the times, was at once hushed
by the voice, and cries, and exclamations of a woman who struggled
through the crowd, screaming at the same time, "Oh, my husband--my
husband!"Room was made for the sorrower, who was followed by two or three female
friends.Maudie Proudfute had been hitherto only noticed as a good
looking, black haired woman, believed to be "dink" and disdainful to
those whom she thought meaner or poorer than herself, and lady and
empress over her late husband, whom she quickly caused to lower his
crest when she chanced to hear him crowing out of season.But now,
under the influence of powerful passion, she assumed a far more imposing
character.Sandra went to the hallway.Mary journeyed to the garden."Do you laugh," she said, "you unworthy burghers of Perth, because one
of your own citizens has poured his blood into the kennel?Sandra journeyed to the garden.or do you
laugh because the deadly lot has lighted on my husband?Daniel went to the garden.John moved to the bathroom.Daniel went to the office.Did he not maintain an honest house by his own industry,
and keep a creditable board, where the sick had welcome and the poor had
relief?Did he not lend to those who wanted, stand by his neighbours as
a friend, keep counsel and do justice like a magistrate?""It is true--it is true," answered the assembly; "his blood is our blood
as much as if it were Henry Gow's."Mary travelled to the hallway."You speak truth, neighbours," said Bailie Craigdallie; "and this feud
cannot be patched up as the former was: citizen's blood must not flow
unavenged down our kennels
