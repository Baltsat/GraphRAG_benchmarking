Sandra moved to the bedroom.Back and forth across a long, down-sweeping ridge
they wove their toilsome way toward the clouds, which grew each hour more
formidable, awesome with their weight, ponderous as continents in their
majesty of movement.John went to the hallway.The horses began to labor with roaring breath, and
Wayland, dismounting to lighten his pony's burden, was dismayed to
discover how thin the air had become.Even to walk unburdened gave him a
smothering pain in his breast.Sandra went to the hallway.Sandra journeyed to the garden."My rule is to ride the hill going up
and walk it going down.Mary moved to the office.Down hill is harder on a horse than going up."John travelled to the bathroom.Nevertheless he persisted in clambering up some of the steepest parts of
the trail, and was increasingly dismayed by the endless upward reaches of
the foot-hills.A dozen times he thought, "We must be nearly at the top,"
and then other and far higher ridges suddenly developed.Occasionally the
Supervisor was forced to unsling an ax and chop his way through a fallen
tree, and each time the student hurried to the spot, ready to aid, but
was quite useless.He admired the ease and skill with which the older man
put his shining blade through the largest bole, and wondered if he could
ever learn to do as well."One of the first essentials of a ranger's training is to learn to swing
an ax," remarked McFarlane, "and you never want to be without a real

government sign--a long blaze with two notches above it.You can trust
these trails; they lead somewhere."Sandra journeyed to the office."As you ride a trail study how to improve it," added the Supervisor,
sheathing his ax.Sandra travelled to the bedroom.Wayland was sure of this a few steps farther on, when the Supervisor's
horse went down in a small bog-hole, and Berrie's pony escaped only by
the most desperate plunging.The girl laughed, but Wayland was appalled
and stood transfixed watching McFarlane as he calmly extricated himself
from the saddle of the fallen horse and chirped for him to rise."You act as if this were a regular part of the journey," Wayland said to
Berrie.Daniel travelled to the bedroom."It's all in the day's work," she replied; "but I despise a bog worse
than anything else on the trail.I'll show you how to go round this one."Thereupon she slid from her horse and came tiptoeing back along the edge
of the mud-hole.McFarlane cut a stake and plunged it vertically in the mud."That means
'no bottom,'" he explained.cried Barney, "it's a bit ago we were ravin' at our
luck: It's givin' thanks we should be this minute."Inza is safe, Rolf Raymond
is dead, and----"
