he exclaimed, "how do you come to be here?There was general silence for a moment; but these boys had been taught
by pious parents to speak the truth always, whatever came of it.that is the right principle to go on, dear children; TELL THE TRUTH when
you have done anything wrong, even if you are sure of being punished
when that truth is known.Daniel went back to the garden.So George, as the eldest, with one brave look at his comrades, frankly
related everything that had happened; beginning at the quarrel with
Tom, down to the escape from the bull.To describe the varied expression
of his auditor's face between delight and vexation, would require a
painter; and when George at last said, "Do you think we deserve to be
punished, sir?or have we paid well enough already for our court

and he would have given sixpence for any way of getting out but by
