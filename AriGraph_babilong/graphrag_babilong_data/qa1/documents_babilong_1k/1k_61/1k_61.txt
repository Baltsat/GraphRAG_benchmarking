And that disease is not
money madness, but _failurephobia_.The fear of failing, or of being called a failure, dominates the
professional world as no other power could.It claims thousands of poor
fellows who were brought up to the active, worth-while life of the farm or
of a trade, and chains them to a miserable, sham, death-in-life sort of
existence, that they come to loathe, but dare not leave because of their
disease, failurephobia.Succeed in your business or profession,
by honest means if you can, but _succeed_!At least, keep up the
appearance of succeeding, and you may keep your place in society.It may
be known that your business is poor, and that you go to your office and
sit in solitude day in and day out, and that you starve and skimp at home,
but so long as you keep up the _show_, you are a "professional man!"What
mighty courage it takes to acknowledge what everybody else knows, and
_quit_!A writer in a medical journal told of a young physician in Boston
who put an ad.in a daily paper asking for a job in which a strong man
could use the strength a manly man ought to be proud of, to earn an honest
living.If men only had the courage, I wonder how many such ads.would
appear in the columns of our papers!An old schoolmate, who is a lawyer in a Western city, told me that of the
more than two hundred lawyers of that city, twenty had practically all the
law business, and of that twenty a half dozen got the big cases in which
there was most money.It is largely so in every city and town.And what
applies to the lawyer applies to the physician, though perhaps not to so
great an extent.And while the fortunate few get most of the practice,
and make most of the money, what are the unfortunate many doing?Holding
on, starving, skimping, keeping up appearances, and, while young, hoping
against hope for better days.But when hope long deferred has made the
soul sick, and hope itself dies, what then?Keep up appearances, you are a
professional man.It would be humorous, were it
not so pathetic, to see the old doctor who has dragged along for years,
barely eking out a living, put on the silk hat of his more ambitious days
and wear it with dignity along with his shiny threadbare trousers and
short coat, making a desperate spurt to keep up with the dashing young
fellow just out of school._Failurephobia!_ Among professional men what a terrible disease it is!I
have known it to drive a young man, who might have been happy and useful
as a farmer or mechanic, into a suicide's grave.Who are the M.D.s whose pictures and glaring ads.appear in
those 15-cent papers published in Augusta, Me., and in many daily and even
religious papers?Are they men who took to graft and disgraced their
profession because they loved that kind of life, and the stigma it brings?Most ofJohn moved to the kitchen.Daniel went back to the bedroom.
