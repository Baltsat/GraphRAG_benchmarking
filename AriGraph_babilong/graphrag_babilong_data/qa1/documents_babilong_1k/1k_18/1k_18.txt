Mary moved to the bathroom.“Of course they couldn’t prevent us going,
but they’d put up a kick that would make it unpleasant.”

“Indeed they would!” answered Jimmie.“But, at the same time, they’d go
themselves if they’d got hold of the idea first.I suggested it, you
know, and that’s one reason why they would reject it.”

Arrived at the hotel, Jimmie and Carl had no difficulty in getting a
double room, although their chums looked rather suspiciously at them as
they all entered the elevator.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.“Now,” said Ben, “don’t you boys get into any mischief to-night.Quito
isn’t a town for foreigners to explore during the dark hours!”

“I’m too sleepy to think of any midnight adventures!” cried Jimmie with
a wink and a yawn.“Me, too!” declared Carl.“I’ll be asleep in about two minutes!”

It was about ten o’clock when the boys found themselves alone in a large
room which faced one of the leading thoroughfares of the capital city.Quito is well lighted by electricity, and nearly all the conveniences of

and we don’t want to lose any time.”

Before leaving the room the boys saw that their automatic revolvers and
searchlights were in good order.Sandra journeyed to the garden.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Sandra travelled to the hallway.They also made neat packages of the
woolen blankets which they found on the bed and carried them away.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.“Now,” said Jimmie as they reached a side street and passed swiftly
along in the shadow of a row of tall buildings, “we’ve got to get into a
cab without attracting any attention, for we’ve stolen the hotel’s
blankets, and we can’t talk Spanish, and if a cop should seize us we’d
have a good many explanations to make.”

“I don’t think it’s good sense to take the blankets,” Carl objected.“Aw, you’ll think so when we get a couple of thousand feet up in the
