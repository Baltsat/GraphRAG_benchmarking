John went to the bathroom.New floors were being put in where the
old ones were decayed, and upstairs two of the rooms were being made
into one by demolishing the parting wall and substituting an iron
girder.John journeyed to the kitchen.Some of the window frames and sashes were so rotten that they
were being replaced.Some of the ceilings and walls were so cracked and
broken that they had to be replastered.Openings were cut through
walls and doors were being put where no doors had been before.Old
broken chimney pots were being taken down and new ones were being taken
up and fixed in their places.All the old whitewash had to be washed
off the ceilings and all the old paper had to be scraped off the walls
preparatory to the house being repainted and decorated.Mary travelled to the garden.The air was
full of the sounds of hammering and sawing, the ringing of trowels, the
rattle of pails, the splashing of water brushes, and the scraping of
the stripping knives used by those who were removing the old wallpaper.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Sandra journeyed to the garden.Besides being full of these the air was heavily laden with dust and
disease germs, powdered mortar, lime, plaster, and the dirt that had
been accumulating within the old house for years.In brief, those
employed there might be said to be living in a Tariff Reform
Paradise--they had Plenty of Work.At twelve o'clock Bob Crass--the painters' foreman--blew a blast upon a
whistle and all hands assembled in the kitchen, where Bert the
apprentice had already prepared the tea, which was ready in the large
galvanized iron pail that he had placed in the middle of the floor.By
the side of the pail were a number of old jam-jars, mugs, dilapidated
tea-cups and one or two empty condensed milk tins.Each man on the
'job' paid Bert threepence a week for the tea and sugar--they did not
have milk--and although they had tea at breakfast-time as well as at
dinner, the lad was generally considered to be making a fortune.Daniel went to the bathroom.Two pairs of steps, laid parallel on their sides at a distance of about
eight feet from each other, with a plank laid across, in front of the
fire, several upturned pails, and the drawers belonging to the dresser,
formed the seating accommodation.The floor of the room was covered
with all manner of debris, dust, dirt, fragments of old mortar and
plaster.Sandra went back to the bedroom.A sack containing cement was leaning against one of the
walls, and a bucket containing some stale whitewash stood in one corner.Now, naturally, the people who are engineering the ghost
lights and all that sort of thing there see the fellows coming and get
the apparatus out of sight before the visitors arrive.”

“Does Mr.Daniel went back to the hallway.Havens know all about this?” asked Jimmie.“You’re dense, my son!” whispered Ben
