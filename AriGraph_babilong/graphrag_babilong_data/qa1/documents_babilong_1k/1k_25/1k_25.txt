It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not remain:
    And so for quiet I rowed away
      To the waterfall amain:
    But there I drowned while bright was the sky:
    If you made this, it cannot be I.'Only three more such sunny days, and we shall get in all the hay,'
said mother, as she went to make my bed."Arne when a child had not cared much for fairy-tales; but now he
began to love them, and they led him to the sagas and old ballads.He
also read sermons and other religious books; and he was gentle and
kind to all around him.But in his mind arose a strange deep longing:
he made no more songs; but walked often alone, not knowing what was
within him.Many of the places around, which formerly he had not even noticed,
now appeared to him wondrously beautiful.At the time he and his
schoolfellows had to go to the Clergyman to be prepared for
confirmation, they used to play near a lake lying just below the
parsonage, and called the Swart-water because it lay deep and dark
between the mountains.John travelled to the kitchen.He now often thought of this place; and one

hesitation, and entered the hardware store.Tenney was alone in the little office partitioned off by wood and
glass from the open store.He received the account given by Horace of
his visit to the Minster mansion with no indication of surprise, and
with no outward sign of satisfaction.“So far, so good,” he said, briefly.Then, after a moment’s meditation,

standing: “Did you say anything about your terms?”

“Of course not.You don’t show price-lists like a
storekeeper, in the _law!_”

Mr.Tenney smiled just a little at Horace’s haughty tone--a smile of
furtive amusement.“It’s just as well,” he said.“I’ll talk with you
about that later.The old lady’s rather close-fisted.We may make a
point there--by sending in bills much smaller than old Clarke’s used to
be.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Luckily it wasn’t needed.”

The matter-of-fact way in which Mr.Tenney used this “we” grated
disagreeably on the young man’s ear, suggesting as it did a new
partnership uncomfortably vague in form; but he deemed it wise not to
touch upon the subject.His next question, as to the identity of Judge
Wendover, brought upon the stage, however, still a third partner in the
shadowy firm to which he had committed himself.“Oh, Wendover’s in with us.He’s all right,
