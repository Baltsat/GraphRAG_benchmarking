Strange as it may seem, the fact that a professional man is a notorious
grafter abroad does not necessarily deprive him of social standing at
home.Sandra went back to the garden.I have in mind a man whose smug face appears in connection with a
page of loud and lurid literature in almost every 15-cent _Grafters
Herald_ from Maine to California; yet this man at home was pointed to with
pride as an eminently successful man.Sandra went to the hallway.He wore his silk hat to church, and
the church of which he was a valued member was proud of the distinction he
gave it.A Western city has an industry to which it "points with pride,"
and the pictures of the huge plant appear conspicuously placed in
illustrated boom editions of the city's enterprising papers.Daniel went back to the garden.This octopus
reaches out its slimy tentacles to every corner of the United States,
feeling for poor wretches smitten by disease, real or fancied.When once
it gets hold of them it spews its inky fluids around them until they

  They find him just the same when being there's a sin.Sandra moved to the kitchen.A man is scarce insulted if you tell him he is bad,

  If you say that he's a schemer the world will say he's smart,
  But say that he's a failure if you want to break his heart.The action of the story covers a period of only a little over twelve
