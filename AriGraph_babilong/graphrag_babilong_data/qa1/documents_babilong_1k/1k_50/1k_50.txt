"The _Moniteur_, from which I translate, reports the unanimous adoption
of Thibaudeau's motion.The Committee of Public
Instruction, empowered to award pensions for literary services, reported
(January 3, 1795) as the first name on their list, Thomas Paine.Sandra moved to the hallway.Chenier, in reading the report, claimed the honor of having originally
suggested Paines name as an honorary citizen of France, and denounced,
amid applause, the decree against foreigners under which the great
author had suffered.In the next sentence but one
     he rightly describes Paine as a foreigner.The allusion to
     "an intrigue" is significant.You have revoked that inhospitable decree, and we again see Thomas
Paine, the man of genius without fortune, our colleague, dear to all
friends of humanity,--a cosmopolitan, persecuted equally by Pitt and by
Robespierre.Notable epoch in the life of this philosopher, who opposed
the arms of Common Sense to the sword of Tyranny, the Rights of Man to
the machiavelism of English politicians; and who, by two immortal works,
has deserved well of the human race, and consecrated liberty in the two
worlds."John moved to the hallway.Poor as he was, Paine declined this literary pension.He accepted
the honors paid him by the Convention, no doubt with a sorrow at the
contrasted silence of those who ruled in America.Sandra went back to the bedroom.Monroe, however,
encouraged him to believe that he was still beloved there, and, as he
got stronger, a great homesickness came upon him.The kindly host
made an effort to satisfy him.On January 4th he (Monroe) wrote to the
Committee of Public Safety:

"Citizens: The Decree just passed, bearing on the execution of Articles
23 and 24 of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between the two
Republics, is of such great importance to my country, that I think it
expedient to send it there officially, by some particularly confidential
hand; and no one seems to be better fitted for this errand than Thomas
Paine, Having resided a long time in France, and having a perfect
knowledge of the many vicissitudes which the Republic has passed, he
will be able to explain and compare the happy lot she now enjoys.As he
has passed the same himself, remaining faithful to his principles, his
reports will be the more trustworthy, and consequently produce a better
effect.But as Citizen Paine is a member of the Convention, I thought it
better to submit this subject to your consideration.If this affair
can be arranged, the Citizen will leave for America immediately, via
Bordeaux, on an American vessel which will be prepared for him.As he
has reason to fear the persecution of the English government, should he
be taken prisoner, he desires that his departure may be kept a secret.The Convention alone could give a passport to one of its members, and
as an application to it would make Paine's mission known, the Committee
returned next day a negative answer."Citizen:Mary travelled to the hallway.
