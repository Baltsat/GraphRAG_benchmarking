Day after day, I could see the dreadful ravages of this
secret horror; doubly terrible, since they dared not divulge it.Still,
do all that we could, the money could not be obtained.The day preceding
the last one given, Summerfield was summoned before the committee, and
full information given him of the state of affairs.Obdurate, hard and
cruel, he still continued.Finally, a proposition was started, that an
attempt should be made to raise the other half of the money in the city
of New York.To this proposal Summerfield ultimately yielded, but with
extreme reluctance.It was agreed in committee, that I should accompany
him thither, and take with me, in my own possession, evidences of the
sums subscribed here; that a proper appeal should be made to the lending
capitalists, scholars and clergymen of that metropolis, and that, when
the whole amount was raised, it should be paid over to Summerfield, and
a bond taken from him never to divulge his awful secret to any human
being.With this, he seemed to be satisfied, and left us to prepare for his
going the next morning.As soon as he left the apartment, the bishop arose, and deprecated the
action that had been taken, and characterized it as childish and absurd.He declared that no man was safe one moment whilst "that diabolical
wretch" still lived; that the only security for us all, was in his
immediate extirpation from the face of the earth, and that no amount of
money could seal his lips, or close his hands.It would be no crime, he
said, to deprive him of the means of assassinating the whole human
family, and that as for himself he was for dooming him to immediate
death.With a unanimity that was extraordinary, the entire committee coincided.A great many plans were proposed, discussed and rejected, having in view
the extermination of Summerfield.Daniel went to the hallway.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.In them all there was the want of that
proper caution which would lull the apprehensions of an enemy; for
should he for an instant suspect treachery, we knew his nature well
enough to be satisfied, that he would waive all ceremonies and carry his
threats into immediate execution.This circumstance of my rearing has at least delivered me
from certain mistakes of classification which I observe in many of my
superiors, who have apparently no affectionate memories of a goodness
mingled with what they now regard as outworn prejudices.Indeed, my
philosophical notions, such as they are, continually carry me back to
the time when the fitful gleams of a spring day used to show me my own
shadow as that of a small boy on a small pony, riding by the side of a
larger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy uplands which we used to
dignify with the name of hills, or along by-roads with broad grassy
borders and hedgerows reckless of utility, on our way to outlying
hamlets, whose groups of inhabitants were as distinctive to my
imagination as if they had belonged to different regions of the globe.From these we sometimes rode onward to the adjoining parish, where also
