EPISODIC MEMORY: ['be remedied with stones.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.In this fortress a reservoir paved with\nDutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,\nbut it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets\nand may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in', "be taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened\nthat some of the Company's servants sent natives on their behalf,\nwho then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This\nwas mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,"]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about Daniel's location. I will look for sentences that mention Daniel and a place he travelled to or is currently at. 
I found two relevant facts from my memory: 'daniel, travelled to, garden' and 'daniel, went back to, bedroom'. Since the fact 'daniel, went back to, bedroom' implies a more recent action than 'daniel, travelled to, garden', I will use it as the basis for my answer.

Direct answer: Bedroom
