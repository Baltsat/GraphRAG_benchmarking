The Chevrolet Colorado and its counterpart, the GMC Canyon, is a series of compact and later mid-size pickup trucks marketed by American automaker General Motors. They were introduced in 2004 to replace the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15/Sonoma compact pickups. It is named for the U.S. state of Colorado. Along with rival Ford Ranger, the GM twins were the last compact pickup trucks on sale until 2012.
