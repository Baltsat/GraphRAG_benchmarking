Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic - era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a Deva (god) only in the Purana s and the Hindu epics. The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his demon half - brother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the ``glory ''and`` splendours'' of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.
