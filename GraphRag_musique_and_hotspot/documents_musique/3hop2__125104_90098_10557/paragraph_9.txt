Louis, Duke of Burgundy and later Dauphin of France (16 August 1682 â€“ 18 February 1712) was the eldest son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, and father of Louis XV, and briefly heir-apparent to the throne from his father's death in April 1711 to his own death 10 months later. Until he became the official Dauphin of France upon his father's death in 1711, he was known as Le Petit Dauphin to distinguish him from his father, who was known as "le Grand Dauphin". His legitimate male progeny died out in 1883.
