The heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the President and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the ``nuclear option ''during the 113th US Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by ​ ⁄ supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in and then begin their duties.
