"...To Be Loved" is the first single from the band Papa Roach's fourth album, "The Paramour Sessions", and eighth released single in total. The song is a slight return to the band early work, starting with a rapping introduction, but as the introduction goes the rapping then goes into fast screaming making it different from the usual rapping of the band's early releases. Most of the song is singing with Jacoby singing in the verses and also choruses. The song follows the band's hard rock sound of their previous album. The song hit American radio stations on August 7, 2006. The song was played in full on Kerrang! Radio in the United Kingdom on August 1, 2006 and has since become available to download via the iTunes Store and Walmart Downloads store as a radio edit version. On September 18 the single became available in UK stores as a 7" vinyl picture disc with a complimentary Papa Roach sticker. The CD was released on October 11, 2006. The song was used as the official theme song for "WWE Raw" on the USA Network from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009. The song has risen to #8 on the "Mainstream Rock Tracks" and #14 on the "Modern Rock Tracks" and played during the theatrical trailer of the 2008 film Never Back Down.
