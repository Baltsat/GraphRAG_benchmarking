In 1848, Austria was the predominant German state. It was considered the successor to the Holy Roman Empire, which had been dissolved by Napoleon in 1806, and was not resurrected by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.  German Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich had dominated Austrian politics from 1815 until 1848.
