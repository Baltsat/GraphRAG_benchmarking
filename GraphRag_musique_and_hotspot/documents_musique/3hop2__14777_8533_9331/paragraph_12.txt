Germany: Minister of State (Staatsminister in German) is the title given to a parliamentary state secretary (a member of parliament serving as a political aide to a cabinet minister) serving in the Foreign Office or the Chancellor's Office. Accordingly, Minister of State ranks between a Secretary of State and a Federal Minister. It is also used as the title of cabinet ministers of certain German states. Historically, the same title was used (sometimes alternating with other styles), notably as head of government in certain of the many constituent monarchies of pre-reunion Germany, e.g. in Hesse - Darmstadt, Hesse - Kassel (or Hesse - Cassel), Lippe, Schaumburg - Lippe, in Hannover, Mecklenburg - Strelitz, Reuss - Schleiz - Gera and Reuss Junior Line, electorate / kingdom Saxony, Saxe - Altenburg, Saxe - Coburg - Gotha, Saxe - Meiningen, Saxe - Weimar - Eisenach, Schwarzburg - Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg - Sondershausen.
