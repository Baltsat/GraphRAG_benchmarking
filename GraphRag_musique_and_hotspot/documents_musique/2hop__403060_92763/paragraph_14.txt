Hurricane Charley was the first of four individual hurricanes to produce winds of at least 75 mph in Florida in a single season -- Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. It was the third named storm, the second hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15, and at its peak intensity it attained 150 mph (240 km / h) winds, making it a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir - Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength, making it the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in 1992.
