The Mercedes - Benz G - Class, sometimes called G - Wagen (short for Gel√§ndewagen, ``cross country vehicle ''), is a mid-size four - wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr - Daimler - Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes - Benz. In certain markets, it has been sold under the Puch name as Puch G. The G - wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body - on - frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes - Benz GL - Class in 2006, the G - Class is still in production and is one of the longest produced Mercedes - Benz in Daimler's history, with a span of 35 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.
