Washington, D.C. is the current federal capital city of the United States, as it has been since 1800. Each U.S. state has its own capital city, as do many of its Insular areas. Historically, most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.
