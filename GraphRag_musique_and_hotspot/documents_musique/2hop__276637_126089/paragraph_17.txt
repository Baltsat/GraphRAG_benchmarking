In the English NHS charges are made for prescription drugs, and the majority of adults (though not a majority of patients) are required to pay them. Charges were abolished in NHS Wales in 2007, Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland in 2010 and by NHS Scotland in 2011. In 2010 / 11, in England, Â£450m was raised through prescription charges, some 0.5% of the total NHS budget.
