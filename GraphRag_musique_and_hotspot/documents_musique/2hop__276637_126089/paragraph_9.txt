The Shanghai Bull, the Bund Financial Bull or the Bund Bull are monikers associated with a derivative of Arturo Di Modica's "Charging Bull" installed in late April 2010 and unveiled on The Bund in Shanghai on May 15, 2010. The work of art is said to have the same height, length and weight as the New York City "Charging Bull". The bull is reddish as a tribute to the country that commissioned the work. It leans to right instead of the left like "Charging Bull" and has a more menacing tail. The Bull's popularity has been a problem for local authorities.
