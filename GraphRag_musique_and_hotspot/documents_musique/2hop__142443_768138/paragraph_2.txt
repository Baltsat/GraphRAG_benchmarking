Harbinger is the second album released by Dan Seals as a solo artist. Two tracks "Can't Get You Out of My Head", and "I Could Be Lovin' You Right Now" were both released as singles, but both failed to chart. This is his last album for Atlantic, before switching to Liberty/Capitol in 1983. This album was finally released on CD on October 17, 2006.
