Vancouver Opera is the second largest performing arts organization in British Columbia and the largest opera company in western Canada. Its mainstage performances occur in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, other venues in Vancouver and occasionally elsewhere in British Columbia. Vancouver Opera has one of only two professional opera orchestras in Canada (the other being Torontoâ€™s Canadian Opera Company). After many regular seasons with four mainstage productions a year, the company will see its first festival season in 2017. Vancouver Opera also runs a school touring and education program, and various community events.
