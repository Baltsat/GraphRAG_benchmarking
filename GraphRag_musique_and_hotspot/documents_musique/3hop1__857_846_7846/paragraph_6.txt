The Hundred Days' Reform was a failed 104 - day national, cultural, political, and educational reform movement from 11 June to 22 September 1898 in late Qing dynasty China. It was undertaken by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform - minded supporters. Following the issuing of the reformative edicts, a coup d'Ã©tat (``The Coup of 1898 '', Wuxu Coup) was perpetrated by powerful conservative opponents led by Empress Dowager Cixi.
