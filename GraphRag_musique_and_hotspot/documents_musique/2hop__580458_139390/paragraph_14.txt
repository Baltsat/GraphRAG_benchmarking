Huston played Howard in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), directed by his son, John Huston. The film was based on B. Traven's novel, which told the story of three gold diggers in 1920s post-revolution Mexico. Walter Huston won the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film, while John Huston won the Best Director Academy Award, thus making them the first father and son to win at the same ceremony. His last film was the western "The Furies" (1950) with Barbara Stanwyck, where his final lines are "there will never be another one like me".
