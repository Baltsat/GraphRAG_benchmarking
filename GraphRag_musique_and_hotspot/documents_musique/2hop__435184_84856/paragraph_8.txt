Sicilian pizza is pizza prepared in a manner that originated in Sicily, Italy. Sicilian pizza is also known as "sfincione" or focaccia with toppings. In the United States, the phrase "Sicilian pizza" is often synonymous with thick-crust pizza derived from the Sicilian "sfincione" .This type of pizza became a popular dish in western Sicily by the mid-19th century and was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily until the 1860s.
