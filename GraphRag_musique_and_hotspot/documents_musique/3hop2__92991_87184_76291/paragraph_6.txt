According to the Origination Clause of the United States Constitution, all bills for raising revenue, generally tax bills, must originate in the House of Representatives, similar to the Westminster system requirement that all money bills originate in the lower house. Traditionally, though, appropriation bills also originate in the House of Representatives. House appropriations bills begin with ``H.R. '', meaning`` House of Representatives''. In reference to revenue bills, the Constitution also states that the ``Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. ''As with revenue bills, the Senate and House each drafts and considers its own appropriation bill. The Senate then`` cuts - and - pastes,'' substituting the language of its version of a particular appropriation bill for the language of the House bill, then agrees to the bill as amended.
