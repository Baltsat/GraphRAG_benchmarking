John Graham McCrorey (October 11, 1860 â€“ November 20, 1923) was an American businessman who made his fortune as a retailer. McCrorey was the founder of a chain of five and dime stores that bore his name, known as McCrory Stores. The company was so named because McCrorey did not want to pay for extra letters on his store signs, and he eventually changed his legal last name to "McCrory" so as to avoid confusion. The first McCrory store opened in Scottsdale, Pennsylvania in 1882.
