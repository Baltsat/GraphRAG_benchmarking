Orano Cycle, formerly COGEMA ("Compagnie générale des matières nucléaires") and Areva NC, is a French nuclear company. It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: "Atomic Energy Commission"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to "Areva NC" in March 2006. In 2018, it changed its name to Orano Cycle to reflect the restructuring of Areva.
