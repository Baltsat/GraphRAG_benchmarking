The Denmark Place fire occurred on 16 August 1980 at 18 Denmark Place in Central London, United Kingdom. The fire, caused by arson, killed 37 people of eight different nationalities, most of whom were Spanish or Latin American, who were patrons of two unlicensed bars in the building. At the time, "The Sunday Times" suggested that it could be "the worst mass murder in British history".
