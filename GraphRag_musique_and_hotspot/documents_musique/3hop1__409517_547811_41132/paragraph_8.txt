The skeleton of an adult human consists of 206 bones. It is composed of 270 bones at birth, which decreases to 80 bones in the axial skeleton (28 in the skull and 52 in the torso) and 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton (32 × 2 in the upper extremities including both arms and 31 × 2 in the lower extremities including both legs). Many small and variable supernumerary bones, such as some sesamoid bones, are not included in this count.
