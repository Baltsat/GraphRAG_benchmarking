Acral necrosis is a symptom common in bubonic plague. The striking black discoloration of skin and tissue, primarily on the extremities (``acral ''), is commonly thought to have given rise to the name`` Black Death,'' associated both with the disease and the pandemic which occurred in the 14th century. The term in fact came from the figural sense of ``black '', that is ghastly, lugubrious or dreadful.
