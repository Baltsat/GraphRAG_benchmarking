Upon independence in August 1947, the title of Viceroy was abolished. The representative of the British Sovereign became known once again as the Governor - General. C. Rajagopalachari became the only Indian Governor - General. However, once India acquired independence, the Governor - General's role became almost entirely ceremonial, with power being exercised on a day - to - day basis by the Indian cabinet. After the nation became a republic in 1950, the President of India continued to perform the same functions.
