Mila Kunis is the voice of the character named Meg Griffin. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. Kunis described her character as ``the scapegoat ''. She further explained,`` Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14 - year - old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what - not. She's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation. And it's fun.''
