Critical reception for ``Blagsnarst, a Love Story ''was mostly positive. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode an A - stating:`` The episode features Kim Kardashian, a move that should feel like shameless stunt - casting, except she's on hand to play a furry pink alien; this is in keeping with American Dad's admirable habit of reeling in impressive guest voices and casting them in unrecognizable roles. The episode features Roger and Stan at their most casually sociopathic, yet both find just enough hidden emotional depth for the episode to not feel completely mean - spirited.''
