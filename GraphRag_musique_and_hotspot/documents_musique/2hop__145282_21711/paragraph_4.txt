As the principal and most remarkable feature of King Louis XIV of France's third building campaign of the Palace of Versailles (1678â€“1684), construction of the Hall of Mirrors began in 1678. To provide for the Hall of Mirrors as well as the "salon de la guerre" and the "salon de la paix", which connect the "grand appartement du roi" with the "grand appartement de la reine", architect Jules Hardouin Mansart appropriated three rooms from each apartment as well as the terrace that separated the two apartments.
