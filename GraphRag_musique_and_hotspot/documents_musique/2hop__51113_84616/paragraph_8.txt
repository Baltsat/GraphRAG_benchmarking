``The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress ''(sometimes titled as`` The Moon's a Harsh Mistress'') is a song by American songwriter Jimmy Webb. It has become a much - recorded standard, without ever having charted as a single. Webb appropriated the title from the 1966 science fiction novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein. The song is especially associated with Glen Campbell, who performed the song on his farewell tour, Judy Collins, and Joe Cocker, who first recorded the song in 1974.
