The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars. One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons) and Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano - British leader who fought against the invading Anglo - Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum, a 9th - century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single - handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum.
