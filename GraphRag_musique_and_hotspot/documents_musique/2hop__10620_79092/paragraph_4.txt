After the Anglo - Saxon period, Britain was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae (c. 1136) refers to the island as Britannia major (``Greater Britain ''), to distinguish it from Britannia minor (`` Lesser Britain''), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany, which had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by migrants from Britain. The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily the daughter of Edward IV of England, and James the son of James III of Scotland, which described it as ``this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee ''. It was used again in 1604, when King James VI and I styled himself`` King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland''.
