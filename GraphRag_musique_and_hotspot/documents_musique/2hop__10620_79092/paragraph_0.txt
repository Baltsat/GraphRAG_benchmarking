Catellus () was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth's work "Historia Regum Britanniae". According to Geoffrey, he was the son of King Gerennus and was succeeded by his son, Millus. In some versions of the "Brut y Brenhinedd", a series of Welsh versions of Geoffrey's "Historia", Catellus is succeeded by his son Coel, who is then succeeded by his own son Porrex II.
