John Petrie was born 15 January 1822 in Edinburgh, the eldest son of Andrew Petrie and Mary Cuthbertson. He arrived in Sydney with his family in 1831 and was educated at John Dunmore Lang's school. In 1837 he went to Moreton Bay, where his father had been appointed clerk of works, and accompanied him on explorations to the west and north of Brisbane; he also became a champion oarsman. Aware that his son might be unduly influenced by the incarcerated men at the penal colony, his father only selected workmen that he considered beyond reproach to come to his home in the evening to teach his sons cabinet making and carpentry skills.
