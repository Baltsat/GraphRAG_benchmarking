HMAS "Doomba was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) warship of World War II. Built for the Royal Navy around the end of World War I as the Hunt-class minesweeper HMS "Wexford, the ship only saw two years of service before she was decommissioned in 1921 and sold to the Doomba Shipping Company. The vessel was renamed SS "Doomba", converted into a passenger ship, and operated in the waters around Brisbane until 1939, when she was requisitioned by the RAN for wartime service. Serving first as an auxiliary minehunter, then an auxiliary anti-submarine vessel, HMAS "Doomba" was purchased outright by the RAN in 1940, and served until early 1946, when she was sold and converted into a linseed oil lighter. "Doomba" was scuttled off Dee Why, New South Wales in 1976.
