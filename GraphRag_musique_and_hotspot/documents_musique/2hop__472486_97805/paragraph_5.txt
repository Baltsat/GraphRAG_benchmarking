Bremse was built as an artillery training ship (Artillerieschulschiff ) of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" with a secondary function as a testbed for new marine diesel engines later installed in German panzerschiffs. During World War II, she operated as an escort ship until her sinking in September 1941.
