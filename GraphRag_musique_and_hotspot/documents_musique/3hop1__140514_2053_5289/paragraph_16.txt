New York Times Youth Forum was a public affairs program, sponsored by "The New York Times" and aired Sundays at 5pm EST on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network from September 14, 1952, to June 14, 1953. The host was Dorothy Gordon (born Dorothy Lerner, 1889-1970), who continued to host the show on WABD from the time the network closed in 1956 until 1958 when it moved to WRCA-TV (now WNBC).
