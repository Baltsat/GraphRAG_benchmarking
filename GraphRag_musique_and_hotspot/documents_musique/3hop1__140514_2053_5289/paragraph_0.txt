Cannonball Run 2001 is a reality television series broadcast on the USA Network in 2001. It was inspired by the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an outlaw road race of the 1970s which was the source for the famous "Cannonball Run" movies. The show featured a series of five location-specific challenges along a New York-to-Los Angeles course, as in the original race.
