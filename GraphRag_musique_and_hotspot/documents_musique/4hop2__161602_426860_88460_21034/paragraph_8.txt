The current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation (s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation (s) over a period of about a month.
