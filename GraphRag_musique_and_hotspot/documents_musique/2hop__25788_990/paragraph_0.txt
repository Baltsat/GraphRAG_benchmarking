MS - DOS (/ ˌɛmˌɛsˈdɒs / em - ess - DOSS; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system for x86 - based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS - DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS - DOS, are sometimes referred to as ``DOS ''(which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS - DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.
