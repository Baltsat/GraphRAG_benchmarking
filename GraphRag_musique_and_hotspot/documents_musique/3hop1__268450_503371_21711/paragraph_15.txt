The execution of Louis XVI, by means of the guillotine, a major event of the French Revolution, took place on 21 January 1793 at the Place de la RÃ©volution (``Revolution Square '', formerly Place Louis XV, and renamed Place de la Concorde in 1795) in Paris. The National Convention had convicted the king (17 January 1792) in a near - unanimous vote (while no one voted`` not guilty'', several deputies abstained) and condemned him to death by a simple majority.
