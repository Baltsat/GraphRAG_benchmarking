When the field is configured for American football, the Patriots have their ``Flying Elvis ''logo painted on the field at dead center of the 50 - yard line. Off to both sides along the 50 - yard line, the Gillette Stadium logo is also painted on the field. This is a gray - and - yellow stylized representation of the bridge and tower at the north entrance of the stadium.
