DU Stadium (sometimes referred to as Hilltop Stadium) was a stadium in the western United States, on the campus of the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. Built in 1926, the crescent-shaped main grandstand design on the west sideline was based on other similar-sized stadiums from the same the time period, Brown Stadium and Cornell's Schoellkopf Field, both in the Ivy League.
