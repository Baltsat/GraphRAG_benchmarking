Kirby's Dream Land is an action platform video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. Released in 1992, it is the first video game in the "Kirby" series and the debut of Kirby. As the inaugural "Kirby" title it created many conventions that would appear in later games in the series. However, Kirby's iconic copy ability would not appear until "Kirby's Adventure", released less than one year later.
