Tetrisphere is a falling block puzzle video game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) console. Developed by Canadian company H2O Entertainment, a nearly complete version of the game was originally slated for release on the Atari Jaguar in early 1995. After Nintendo obtained its publishing rights, "Tetrisphere" was reworked for the N64 and released on the platform in North America on August 11, 1997, and the PAL regions in February 1998.
