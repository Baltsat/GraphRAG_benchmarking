University Heights is a 2004 film written and directed by Scott Beck and produced by Bryan Woods and Bluebox Limited Films. "University Heights" boasts a sweeping ensemble cast in the story of four lives on a college campus - a drug-dealing professor, a teacher struggling with his homosexuality, a drug-abusing student, and a bigot trying to escape his hateful tendencies. Chronicled with tales of love, loss, abuse, and frayed relationships, "University Heights" is ultimately a story of redemption. The film was shot entirely in Iowa and many scenes were filmed on at The University of Iowa. The film was subsequently recognized by MTV and the filmmakers signed a development deal with MTV Films.
