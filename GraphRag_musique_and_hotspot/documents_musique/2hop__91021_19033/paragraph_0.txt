The 1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships. In the final, Bj√∂rn Borg defeated John McEnroe 1 -- 6, 7 -- 5, 6 -- 3, 6 -- 7, 8 -- 6 to win the match. It was regarded at the time as the greatest match ever played. It would be another 28 years before the 2008 Wimbledon men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal would rival the match as the greatest ever played.
