Live at the Palace 2008 is the first DVD release from Canadian rock band Three Days Grace. Three Days Grace dedicated this DVD, in loving memory, to their manager and friend Stuart Sobol. The DVD was originally released as a Best Buy exclusive in August 2008, but is now available at other retailers.
