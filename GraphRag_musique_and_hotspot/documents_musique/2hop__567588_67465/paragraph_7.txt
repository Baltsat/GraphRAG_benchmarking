Imaginary Day is a jazz album by the Pat Metheny Group, released in 1997 by Warner Bros. Records. The album overall was strongly inspired by world music from Iran and Indonesia, and won the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. The song "The Roots of Coincidence" won a Grammy award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance; critic Richard Ginnell of Allmusic described the song as a dramatic departure for the group: "[an] out-and-out rock piece with thrash metal and techno-pop episodes joined by abrupt jump cuts."
