The Secret Sin is a surviving 1915 silent film drama produced by Jesse Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Frank Reicher and starred Blanche Sweet, Thomas Meighan and Sessue Hayakawa. This film often thought lost actually survives at the Library of Congress and along with a few other surviving Lasky features from 1915-17 allows viewing of Blanche Sweet during her Paramount period immediately after she left D. W. Griffiths employ. In this film Sweet has a rare chance to act in a double exposure scene playing two different characters.
