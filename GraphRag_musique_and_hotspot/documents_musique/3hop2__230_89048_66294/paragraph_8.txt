John Ritter voiced Clifford in all episodes. This was originally done by Brent Titcomb in the 1988 direct - to - video series. Generally speaking, Ritter's schedule dictated the production of Clifford the Big Red Dog. By the time the last of the 68 half - hour cartoons and the subsequent film Clifford's Really Big Movie were completed, Ritter was back on ABC's prime - time schedule, starring in 8 Simple Rules. Ritter's death on September 11, 2003 came less than a week before PBS debuted Clifford's Puppy Days, a show that kept Clifford's legacy going.
