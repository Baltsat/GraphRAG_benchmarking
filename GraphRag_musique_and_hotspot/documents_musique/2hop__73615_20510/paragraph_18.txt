Founded in 1998, Indian River Charter High School enrolls 750 students in grades 9 through 12. Located next door to Indian River State College’s Mueller Campus, students are encouraged to participate in dual enrollment. IRCHS has regularly rated an “A” or “B” school by Florida’s School Rating System and has been the highest rated high school in Indian River County for the past ten years. Students shoulder a great deal of responsibility within the school environment, from the open campus, to Homebase expectations, and participation in community projects such as cultural events, government meetings, and volunteer activities. Each student is expected to follow a seven point behavior contract in order to remain a student at IRCHS. All students, staff and board members are required to submit to random drug testing in order to remain in the school.
