In 1936, Geoghegan became Attorney General of Ireland, serving for less than two months. In spite of his brief tenure he assisted the government in the preparation and enactment of the External Relations Act, before being appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court on 22 December 1936. He immediately resigned his DÃ¡il seat. Geoghegan remained on the bench of the Supreme Court until his retirement, due to ill health, in April 1950. His son, Hugh Geoghegan enjoyed the distinction in 2000 of being the first appointee to Ireland's Supreme Court to follow in his father's footsteps.
