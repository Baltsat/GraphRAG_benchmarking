Lake Michigan -- Huron (also Huron -- Michigan) is the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which are joined through the 5 - mile (8.0 km) wide, 20 - fathom (120 ft; 37 m) deep, open - water Straits of Mackinac. Huron and Michigan are hydrologically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near - equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake Michigan -- Huron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either.
