Changes Two is an album by Charles Mingus. It was recorded on 27, 28, and 30 December 1974 at Atlantic Studios in New York Cityâ€”the same sessions which resulted in Mingus' album "Changes One". Accordingly, Atlantic Records initially released the record. In 1993, it was issued on CD by Rhino Records.
