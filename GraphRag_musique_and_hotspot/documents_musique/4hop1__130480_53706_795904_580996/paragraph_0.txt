The Patapsco Swinging Bridge is located in the Avalon/Orange Grove area of Patapsco Valley State Park in central Maryland, United States. It is a suspension bridge consisting of a wooden deck supported by large cables. The Patapsco Valley has a history of "swinging" bridges built for pedestrian travel from one side of the river to the other. The Orange Grove Flour Mill was one such popular crossing and is where the current bridge now stands. The first bridge was built by the Orange Grove Flour Mill for employees to cross the river. The new swinging bridge, built by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, is one of the most well known and most popular attractions at the Patapsco Valley State Park.
