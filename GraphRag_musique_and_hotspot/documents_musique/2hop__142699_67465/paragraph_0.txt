The song was written in collaboration with Lori Lieberman, who recorded the song in late 1971. In 1973 it became a number - one hit in the US and Canada for Roberta Flack, also reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart. Many artists have covered the song; the version by the Fugees won the 1997 Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.
