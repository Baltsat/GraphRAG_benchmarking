Jam Session is a live album by American trumpeters Clifford Brown, Clark Terry and Canadian trumpeter Maynard Ferguson featuring tracks recorded in early 1954 and released on the EmArcy label. The album was recorded at the same session that produced Dinah Washington's "Dinah Jams" and is often credited to the Clifford Brown All Stars.
