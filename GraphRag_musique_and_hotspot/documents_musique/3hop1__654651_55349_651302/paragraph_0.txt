Jerome ``Chef ''McElroy is a cartoon character on the Comedy Central series South Park who was voiced by Isaac Hayes. A cafeteria worker at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef is generally portrayed as more level - headed than the other adult residents of the town, and sympathetic to the children. His guidance is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists -- Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick -- as he is usually the only adult whom they consistently trusted. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song.
