The Voice of ``Stan ''(Stephen Full) is the James - Jennings family's new dog who blogs and talks. He keeps his secret of talking from Ellen and Bennett, and the only people who know that Stan can talk are Avery, Tyler, Chloe, Karl, and Grandma James. Stan hates noisy pomeranians and has a deep love of poodles. It is shown that Avery is his favorite child which is also based on the fact they talk to each other the most of the three kids. As shown in`` World of Woofcraft'', he likes the game ``Realm of the Tower ''. Although at times he seems almost human, he is still a dog and has many dog qualities and is very sensitive about it. Stan, while he does not like to admit it, is also part cat and blames the fact that his dog ancestor`` married'' his one cat ancestor because it was the 1970s. Stan has a beloved toy monkey named Robert who is his companion. Grandma James found Robert while cleaning the family room and announced that the toy was so disgustingly filthy, it was going straight to the trash. Stan panicked and shouted Robert's name right in front of her, exposing his secret and making Grandma James faint. Stan is also very sensitive about being called ``just a dog '', which Avery called him in the episode`` Stan Runs Away''. After a year of secretly writing a blog about his experiences with the family, Avery, Chloe, and Tyler soon discover Stan's blog in ``The Kids Find Out Stan Blogs ''.
