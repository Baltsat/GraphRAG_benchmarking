The Hampton Bluffs () are a group of three rock bluffs on the east side of Larsen Inlet, Graham Land, Antarctica. They were mapped from surveys by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) (1960â€“61), and were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for Ian F.G. Hampton, an FIDS physiologist at Hope Bay in 1959 and 1960.
