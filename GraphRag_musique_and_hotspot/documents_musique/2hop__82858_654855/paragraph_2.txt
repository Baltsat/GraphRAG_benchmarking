Socialist Workers' Current () is a far-left Trotskyist political organisation in Brazil, created in 1992 by a split of the Socialist Convergence. CST is an active tendency of the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) and the Brazilian section of the International Workers' Unity – Fourth International. CST split from Worker's Party (PT) when its federal deputy Babá was expelled from PT, after voting against the pension reform proposed by ex-president Lula.
