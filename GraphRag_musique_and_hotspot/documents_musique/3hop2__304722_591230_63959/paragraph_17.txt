Everton Football Club have a long and detailed history. The club's roots loosely lie with a Methodist New Connexion congregation who had a chapel on the corner of Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale in Everton, Liverpool. Initially formed as St. Domingo FC, named after the location of the chapel, the football team was renamed Everton in 1878 after the district of Everton. Since then Everton have had a successful history winning the Cup Winners' Cup, the league title nine times and the FA Cup five times. They are the only club to have played over 100 seasons in the top flight of English football, the 2014 -- 15 season being their 112th.
