The Urdu lyrics, written by the Pakistani Urdu - language poet, Hafeez Jullundhri in 1952, have commonality with Persian, making them understandable in both languages. No verse in the three stanza lyrics is repeated. The anthem has heavy Persian poetic vocabulary and only uses one exclusively Urdu word 'kā'.
