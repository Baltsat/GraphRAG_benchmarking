``In Plenty and In Time of Need ''is the national anthem of the country of Barbados. It was written by Irving Burgie (1926 --) and was composed by C. Van Roland Edwards (1912 -- 1985). As one part of the West Indies Federation from 1958 -- 1962, Barbados' anthem was supposed to be Forged from the Love of Liberty (which is currently the national anthem of Trinidad and Tobago), however the current anthem was created with Barbados' moves toward full independence. This song was then adopted by Barbados when it became independent in 1966.
