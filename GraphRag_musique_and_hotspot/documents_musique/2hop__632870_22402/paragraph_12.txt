Black Cobain attended Virginia State University, graduated magna cum laude, and obtained employment at the Boys & Girls Club, uncertain he could make a viable living and income from his ambitions as an emcee. During this time, he linked with long-time friend and mentor, Le'Greg O. Harrison, and under his direction began to professionalize his sound and actively exploit his talent through local performances, collaborations, sets, and freestyles. In 2009, Black signed to The Board Administration as their first official signee and shortly thereafter left full-time employment to fully pursue emceeing as a career.
