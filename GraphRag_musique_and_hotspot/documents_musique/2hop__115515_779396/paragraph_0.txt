Founded in 1880 by Mathias Hatz, the company began to build engines in 1904. In 1910, Hatz began to produce hot bulb engines for stationary use. Based on that engine, the first Hatz water-cooled diesel engine, the H-series, was developed (max. power: 6 kW; engine speed: 500 rpm; weight: 430 kg). Three years later, a new plant was built at the present location and Hatz started to export engines to South America. In 1936, a two stroke engine with horizontal cylinder layout, the L2, which was especially intended for the use by the construction industry (max. power: 8 kW; engine speed: 1100 rpm; weight: 360 kg) was developed.
