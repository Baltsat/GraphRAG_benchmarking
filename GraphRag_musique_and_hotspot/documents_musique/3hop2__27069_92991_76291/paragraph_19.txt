A filibuster in the United States Senate is a dilatory or obstructive tactic used in the United States Senate to prevent a measure from being brought to a vote. The most common form of filibuster occurs when one or more senators attempts to delay or block a vote on a bill by extending debate on the measure. The Senate rules permit a senator, or a series of senators, to speak for as long as they wish, and on any topic they choose, unless ``three - fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn ''(usually 60 out of 100) bring the debate to a close by invoking cloture under Senate Rule XXII.
