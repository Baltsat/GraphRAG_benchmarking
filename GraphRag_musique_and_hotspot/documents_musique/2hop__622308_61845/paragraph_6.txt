Graham joined Barnsley from non-league Hall Green in 1953, while still working as a miner at Haigh Colliery. He stayed with Barnsley for several seasons, but left when the club was relegated at the end of the 1958–59 season. After a brief spell at Bristol City, he moved to Leyton Orient for £8000 on 20 June 1960.
