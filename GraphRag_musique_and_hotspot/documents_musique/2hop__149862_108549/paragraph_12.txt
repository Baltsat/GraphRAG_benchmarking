BULLET::::- Cosmic Boy, along with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, made his live-action debut in the eleventh episode of the eighth season of the CW series "Smallville", portrayed by actor Ryan Kennedy. In the episode, Rokk is seen as the silent leader type. The most determined of the group, Rokk comes the closest to killing Chloe Sullivan, only to be stopped by Clark Kent, who informs Rokk that any Legion inspired by him should never resort to murder. When the group does defeat Brainiac by extracting him from Chloe - Rokk playing a crucial role as he magnetically extracts the particles of Brainiac from her body - Rokk changes the Legion rules accordingly. Just before he leaves, Rokk warns Clark of the days ahead, telling him to be careful. Though mainly referred to as Rokk, Lightning Lad calls him "Cos" at one point in the episode. He later returns in the season finale to give Clark a new Legion ring after his was destroyed in "Infamous" and warns him that nothing can stop Doomsday from killing him. He gives Clark the ring and tells him to send Doomsday to the future, as the Legion is prepared to fight him there.
