Vytautas Bacevičius (born Vytautas Bacewicz in Łódź, Poland (then Russian Empire), 9 September 1905 – New York City, United States, 15 January 1970) was a Lithuanian composer of radical and modernistic leanings. Most of his works are in an atonal idiom of his own devising. He developed a theory of 'cosmic music' and came to regard Schoenberg's 12-note music as out-dated, regarding himself as a successor to Scriabin, André Jolivet and Varèse.
