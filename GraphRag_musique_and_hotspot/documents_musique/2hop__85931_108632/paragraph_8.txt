The Schmidt Artist Lofts, located in the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, was originally built to brew beer for Schmidt Brewery. The Schmidt Brewery was vacant for 11 years until a massive community and developer effort resulted in a plan for a revitalization of the brewery's historic building into the creation of the Schmidt Artist Lofts in 2013.
