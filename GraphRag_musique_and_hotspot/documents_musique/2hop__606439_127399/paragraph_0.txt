Sony released the first consumer camcorder in 1983, the Betamovie BMC - 100P. It used a Betamax cassette and rested on the operator's shoulder, due to a design not permitting a single - handed grip. That year, JVC released the first VHS - C camcorder. Kodak announced a new camcorder format in 1984, the 8 mm video format. Sony introduced its compact 8 mm Video8 format in 1985. That year, Panasonic, RCA and Hitachi began producing camcorders using a full - size VHS cassette with a three - hour capacity. These shoulder - mount camcorders were used by videophiles, industrial videographers and college TV studios. Full - size Super-VHS (S - VHS) camcorders were released in 1987, providing an inexpensive way to collect news segments or other videographies. Sony upgraded Video8, releasing the Hi8 in competition with S - VHS.
