999 or 112 is used to contact the emergency services upon witnessing or being involved in an emergency. In the United Kingdom, the numbers 999 and 112 both connect to the same service, and there is no priority or charge for either of them. Callers dialling 911, the USA's emergency number, will be transferred to the 999 call system if the call is made within the United Kingdom.
