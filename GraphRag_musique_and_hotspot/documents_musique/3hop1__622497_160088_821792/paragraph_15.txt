Women's political status without the vote was promoted by the National Council of Women of Canada from 1894 to 1918. It promoted a vision of ``transcendent citizenship ''for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public - spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation - building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race - based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from`` racial degeneration.''
