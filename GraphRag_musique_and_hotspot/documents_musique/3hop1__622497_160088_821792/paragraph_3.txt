Whiskeytown is an unincorporated community in Shasta County, California, United States. The ZIP Code is 96095. The community is inside area code 530. Although once a bustling mining town, there are very few people living in Whiskeytown as of today. The entire town of Whiskeytown was flooded to make way for Whiskeytown Lake in 1962. The ZIP Code of 96095 is now defunct as it has been taken over by ZIP Code 96033 in nearby French Gulch. The town of Whiskeytown is now properly part of French Gulch as the original post office and store (that were moved to higher ground in 1962) closed after 40 years. But Whiskeytown appears on many maps. All that remains is the relocated store, a few residences, mostly occupied by National Recreation Area personnel, and old mines that are above the water level of the lake. Whiskeytown is registered as a California Historical Landmark.
