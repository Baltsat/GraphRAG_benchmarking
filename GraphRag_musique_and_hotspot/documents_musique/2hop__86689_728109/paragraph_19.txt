Despite having the lowest odds, the Orlando Magic surprisingly won the first pick in the 1993 NBA Draft Lottery. It was the second year in a row the Magic won the draft lottery. The Magic drafted Chris Webber with the number one overall pick, but only minutes later, executed a blockbuster trade. The Magic traded Webber to the Golden State Warriors for their first round pick (# 3 overall) Penny Hardaway and three of Golden State's future first - round draft selections.
