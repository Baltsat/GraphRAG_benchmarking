LeBron James returned to the Cavs in 2014 -- 15 and led the team back to the playoffs for the first time since 2010, where they claimed their second Eastern Conference championship. The following season, Cleveland again won the Eastern Conference and returned to the NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship and first major sports title in the city since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing three games to one. Through the 2016 -- 17 season, the Cavs have made 21 playoff appearances, and won six Central Division titles, four Eastern Conference titles, and one NBA title.
