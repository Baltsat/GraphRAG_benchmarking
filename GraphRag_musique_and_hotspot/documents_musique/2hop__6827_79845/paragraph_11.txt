Tantalizingly Hot is the sixth album by American recording artist Stephanie Mills, released in 1982 and was produced by James Mtume & Reggie Lucas and Ashford & Simpson. It was her first release, by default, on Casablanca Records. In 1981, oil magnate and industrialist Marvin Davis (1925–2004) and financier Marc Rich (1934–2013) bought Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, which owned her previous label, 20th Century-Fox Records, for a grand total of $703 million.
