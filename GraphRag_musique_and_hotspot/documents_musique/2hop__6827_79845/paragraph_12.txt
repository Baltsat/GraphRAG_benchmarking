Henry Slesar (June 12, 1927 â€“ April 2, 2002) was an American author, playwright, and copywriter. He is famous for his use of irony and twist endings. After reading Slesar's "M Is for the Many" in "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine", Alfred Hitchcock bought it for adaptation and they began many successful collaborations. Slesar wrote hundreds of scripts for television series and soap operas, leading "TV Guide" to call him "the writer with the largest audience in America."
