While many NHL, NBA, and NFL draftees will eventually reach their respective leagues, the vast majority of players selected in the first - year player draft will never play in a single MLB game, including many first - rounders. For example, only 31 of 52 first - round draft picks in the 1997 draft eventually made a big - league appearance, and only 13 of those 31 appeared in more than 100 games as of 2009. In 1997's sixth round, only five of the 30 players selected eventually made a big league appearance, and only two of those five (Tim Hudson and Matt Wise) played more than 40 innings in the majors. Further illustrating the unpredictability of the draft's middle and later rounds, none of the 30 players selected in the 18th round ever reached the major leagues, but the 19th round eventually produced an all - star and World Series MVP, David Eckstein.
