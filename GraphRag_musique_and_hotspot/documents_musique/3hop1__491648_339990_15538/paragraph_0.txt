The Socialist Party of Oregon in Columbia County, Oregon began around the First Red Scare. The first year (1914) it went mainstream, the Socialist party had 27 more registered members than the Prohibition Party, who were some members of the Suffrage movement. The Socialist party was similar to the Progressive Party in the county, as it tried from the outskirts of government to make change. While Socialism failed its first year, it still received attention from the press who was aware of the October Revolution (1918) in Russia (Now the Soviet Union) by a similarly named government led by Vladimir Lenin.
