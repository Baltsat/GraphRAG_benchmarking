Talkdemonic was established by O'Connor in December 2002 after he moved from Pullman, Washington to Portland. It began as a musical project to express his obsession with instrumental hip hop and electronic music. O'Connor said he was at a local club when he heard a voice utter the word "talkdemonic" and he felt it fit his new project perfectly.
