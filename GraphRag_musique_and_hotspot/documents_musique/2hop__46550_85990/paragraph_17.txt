The Elections for the United States House of Representatives on 5 November 2002 was in the middle of President George W. Bush's first term. Although it was a midterm election, the Republican Party gained a net eight seats, solidifying their majority. Together with gains made in the Senate, it was one of the few mid-term elections that the party in control of the White House increased their number of seats in the House (the other such mid-term elections were in 1934 and 1998).
