Planet E Communications is an independent electronic music recording label that started in 1991 in Detroit, Michigan. The label is the brainchild of DJ/Producer Carl Craig. Evolving from Craigâ€™s desire to have creative independence from the major label industry, Planet E would manage, in a short time, to become one of the most ground-breaking independent labels in the genre. When a number of independent techno camps entered a stage of dormancy, Planet E consistently released music that mutated the conventional arrangements of the genre. Planet E has gained its burgeoning success by persistently experimenting with sound, expanding the genre of electronic music beyond the commonplace landscape it has traveled.
