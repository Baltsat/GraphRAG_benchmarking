Ain't Living Long Like This is the debut studio album by American country music singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell, released in 1978 by Warner Bros. Records. It failed to enter the Top Country Albums chart. The songs, "Elvira", "Baby Better Start Turnin' 'Em Down" and "(Now and Then, There's) A Fool Such as I" were released as singles but they all failed to chart within the top 40. Despite this, "Ain't Living Long Like This" is considered one Crowell's best and most influential albums. Brett Hartenbach of Allmusic says it ""not only showcases his songwriting prowess, but also his ability to deliver a song, whether it's one of his own or the work of another writer"". Most of the songs on this album were later covered by other artists including The Oak Ridge Boys and Alan Jackson. When the album was re-released in 2002 the font on the cover was enlarged to make it more legible.
