After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke to record pop music. Serving as her manager, C.L. agreed to the move and helped to produce a two - song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a ``five - percent artist ''. During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin's father to have his label, RCA sign Franklin. He had also been courted by local record label owner Berry Gordy to sign Franklin and her elder sister Erma to his Tamla label. Franklin's father felt the label was not established enough yet. Franklin's first Columbia single,`` Today I Sing the Blues'', was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top ten of the Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers chart.
