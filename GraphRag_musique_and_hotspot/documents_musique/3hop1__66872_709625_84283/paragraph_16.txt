Hux Records is a British record label based in England, which was launched in 1998. They specialise in releasing old material, especially in unreleased BBC recordings such as John Peel Sessions and BBC Radio 1 concerts. Hux has gained a reputation as an excellent independent record label, offering an eclectic selection of classic archive recordings. Hux has also re-released recordings by such artists as Malcolm Morley's Sam Apple Pie and Help Yourself; and Man's debut album, which was recorded in 1976 but not released latterly (the master tapes were lost and only discovered recently).
