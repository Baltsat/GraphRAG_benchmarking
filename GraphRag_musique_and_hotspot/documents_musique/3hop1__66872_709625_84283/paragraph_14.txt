Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet (later retitled Blues in Time) is a jazz album by Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan released in 1957 on the Verve label. The idea for this album was born in 1954, then postponed till summer of 1957 when Desmond suggested to record some pieces together. Producer Norman Granz managed to set up the recording date for the first session in August. "Blues in Time" was also reissued on Verve V 8478 with a different cover (see below).
