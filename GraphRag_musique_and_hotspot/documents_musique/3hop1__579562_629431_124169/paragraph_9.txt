Coles Bashford (January 24, 1816 â€“ April 25, 1878) was an American lawyer and politician who became the fifth Governor of Wisconsin, and one of the founders of the U.S. Republican Party. His one term as governor ended in a bribery scandal that ended in him fleeing Wisconsin, but he was later instrumental in the government of the newly formed Arizona Territory.
