After her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in All the Year Round, edited by Charles Dickens, wrote of her in 1865 that ``(t) he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it. ''It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue - twister`` She sells seashells on the seashore'' by Terry Sullivan. In 2010, one hundred and sixty - three years after her death, the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.
