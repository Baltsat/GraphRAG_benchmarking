I'll Cry If I Want To was the debut album of Lesley Gore. The album included her hit singles "It's My Party" and its follow-up, "Judy's Turn to Cry".

Besides the hit singles, the album included pop standards such as "Misty", "Cry Me a River" and "What Kind of Fool Am I?". The album reached #24 on the "Billboard" 200. Edsel Records released the album on Compact Disc in 2000 in combination with Gore's second album, "Lesley Gore Sings of Mixed-Up Hearts". The album was named the 181st best album of the 1960s by "Pitchfork".
