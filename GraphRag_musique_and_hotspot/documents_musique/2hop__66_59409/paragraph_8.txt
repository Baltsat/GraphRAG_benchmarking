"Dirty Sticky Floors" is the first solo single by Depeche Mode vocalist Dave Gahan and is the lead track on his 2003 debut album, "Paper Monsters". It was released in late May 2003 as the lead single from that album, reaching No.18 in the UK Singles Chart (see 2003 in British music). The song would also reach #5 in "Billboard" magazine's Hot Dance Club Play Chart. The song was slightly remixed in two different forms for its single release and an extended version for the music video.
