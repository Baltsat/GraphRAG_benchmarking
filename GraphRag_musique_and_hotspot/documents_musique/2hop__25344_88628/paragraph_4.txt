After ``Normal ''aired, internet sources began to summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting`` JFK! FDR!'' and walking on chairs. As the cast did not understand the game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to ``have fun, dig in, jump in ''and play it as if`` they'd been playing this thing for years and years and years.'' The high - energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode. Fox subsequently released a set of official rules for the game, which can be summarized ``There are no real rules ''. The characters also played True American in`` Cooler'', the 15th episode of the second season, in ``Mars Landing '', the 20th episode of the third season and in`` Wedding Eve'' the 21st episode of the fifth season.
