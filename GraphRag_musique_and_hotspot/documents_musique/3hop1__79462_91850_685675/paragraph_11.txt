Writers of Sporting News described hitting four home runs in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game as ``baseball's greatest single - game accomplishment ''. Eighteen players have accomplished the feat to date, the most recent being J.D. Martinez of the Arizona Diamondbacks on September 4, 2017 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. No player has done this more than once in his career and no player has ever hit more than four in a game. Bobby Lowe was the first to hit four home runs in a single game, doing so on May 30, 1894. Fans were reportedly so excited that they threw $160 in silver coins ($4,400 today) onto the field after his fourth home run.
