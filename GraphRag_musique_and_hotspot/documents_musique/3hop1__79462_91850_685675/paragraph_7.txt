After the 1972 baseball season, the Royals moved to Royals Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex. The Royals won the final game (and event) at Municipal Stadium, a 4 -- 0 win over the Texas Rangers on October 4, 1972, in also the final Major League game managed by Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Amos Otis scored the final run in Municipal Stadium history and Ed Kirkpatrick had the final hit. Four days prior Gene Tenace of the Oakland A's hit the final home run, and John Mayberry hit the final Royals home run the night before.
