The aortic and pulmonary valves are located at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk respectively. These are also called the ``semilunar valves ''. These two arteries receive blood from the ventricles and their semilunar valves permit blood to be forced into the arteries, and prevent backflow from the arteries into the ventricles. These valves do not have chordae tendineae, and are more similar to the valves in veins than they are to the atrioventricular valves. The closure of the semilunar valves causes the second heart sound.
