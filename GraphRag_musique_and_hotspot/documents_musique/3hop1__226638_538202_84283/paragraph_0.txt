Happiness Is You is the 24th album by country singer Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in 1966 (see 1966 in music). It contains, among others, "Guess Things Happen That Way", a re-recording of one of Cash's earliest Sun songs. The record reached No. 10 on the Country charts. The LP was originally to be titled "That's What You Get For Lovin' Me", taking its title from the Gordon Lightfoot tune included in the album, and promo copies and some early commercial pressings show this title on the label.
