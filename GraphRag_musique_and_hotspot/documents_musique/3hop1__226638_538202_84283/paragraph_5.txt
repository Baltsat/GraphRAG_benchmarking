Hellos & Goodbyes by Buck-O-Nine was released in 2000 on Offramp Records, and consists of fifteen tracks recorded at a live performance in Japan in 1999, plus five previously unreleased studio tracks. This album features drummer Jeff Hawthorne, who became the band's permanent drummer in 1998, and bassist John Bell, who joined the band just a few weeks prior to their tour of Japan. In fact, Bell's first live performances with the band were on this tour. The studio tracks were recorded later in 1999, at the same studio where "Libido" was recorded. Offramp Records was a label started by singer Jon Pebsworth and his wife Laura. The label also released an album by The Scrimmage Heroes, band Buck-O-Nine toured with on its last U.S. tour. The tour ended prematurely when John Bell became ill and required emergency surgery.
