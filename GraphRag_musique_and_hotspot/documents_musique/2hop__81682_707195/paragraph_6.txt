Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (Japanese: BORUTO - ボルト - NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS) is a Japanese manga series written by Ukyō Kodachi (ja) and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto (ja). Serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Boruto is a spin - off of and sequel to Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto, and follows the exploits of Naruto Uzumaki's son Boruto and his ninja team while following a path to follow once they grow up. An anime television series adaptation directed by Noriyuki Abe started airing on TV Tokyo on April 5, 2017. Unlike the manga that started as a retelling of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, the Boruto anime acts like a prequel, before Boruto and his friends became ninjas before the later arc.
