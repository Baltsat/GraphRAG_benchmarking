Jagiellonian Library (, popular nickname "Jagiellonka") is the library of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and with almost 6.7 million volumes, one of the largest libraries in Poland, serving as a public library, university library and part of the Polish national library system. It has a large collection of medieval manuscripts, for example Copernicus' "De Revolutionibus" and Jan Długosz's "Banderia Prutenorum", and a large collection of underground literature (so-called "drugi obieg" or samizdat) from the period of communist rule in Poland (1945–1989). The Jagiellonian also houses the "Berlinka" art collection, whose legal status is in dispute with Germany.
