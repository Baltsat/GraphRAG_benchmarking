In April 2010 the California Fair Political Practices Commission handed down a decision that Tony Strickland and Strickland for State Senate, a member of the California State Senate, and his candidate-controlled committee sent out a mass mailing without the name of the committee on the outside of the mailing. The Commission levied a $3,000 fine.
