The Affordable Health Care for America Act (or HR 3962) was a bill that was crafted by the United States House of Representatives in October 29th of 2009. It never became law as originally drafted. At the encouragement of the Obama administration, the 111th Congress devoted much of its time to enacting reform of the United States' health care system. Known as the ``House bill '', HR 3962 was the House of Representatives' chief legislative proposal during the health reform debate.
