Private Romeo is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" by Alan Brown made in 2011. The film is a reenactment of the play exclusively spoken in an all-male high school military academy called McKinley Military Academy. Amidst this recitation is a gay love blossoming between the two cadets, Sam Singleton / Romeo played by Seth Numrich and Glenn Mangan / Juliet played by Matt Doyle. The film was Brown's take on Don't ask, don't tell, the official United States policy on gays serving in the military from December 21, 1993, to September 20, 2011 (the law was repealed after the production of the film).
