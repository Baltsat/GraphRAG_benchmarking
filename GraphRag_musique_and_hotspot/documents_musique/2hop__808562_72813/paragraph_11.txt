"Don't Ask Me Why" is a Billy Joel song released in 1980. The track contains all acoustic and Latin percussion instruments performing in an Afro-Cuban rhythmic style. An eclectic, instrumental "Latin Ballroom" piano solo, played over the bridge section after the second verse, is also featured in part of the song; Joel states that the mix for the midsection includes "fifteen pianos overdubbed on top of each other." The song spent two weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and peaked at number nineteen on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
