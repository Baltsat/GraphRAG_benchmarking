"I Don't Wanna Take This Pain" is a single performed by Australian singer Dannii Minogue for her debut album "Love and Kisses" (1991). A personal favourite of Minogue's, its original mix was released as the third single in Australia, where it peaked at #92 on the ARIA singles chart in December 1990. A re-recorded and remixed version of the song (by L.A. Mix) was released in the United Kingdom as the fifth and final single in the fourth quarter of 1991, and received a mixed reception from music critics. "I Don't Wanna Take This Pain" became one of Minogue's least successful singles, only just reaching the top forty in the United Kingdom.
