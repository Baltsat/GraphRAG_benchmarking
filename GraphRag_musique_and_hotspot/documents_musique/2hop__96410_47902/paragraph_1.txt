Producer Frank Marshall said Universal Pictures is hoping to plan a sequel to Jason Bourne, making it the sixth Bourne film. He also stated that a sequel to The Bourne Legacy featuring Renner's Cross is unlikely although he did not explicitly rule it out. However, in March 2017, Matt Damon cast doubt upon a sequel, hinting that people ``might be done ''with the character.
