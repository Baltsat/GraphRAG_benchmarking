The second generation Apple TV was unveiled on September 1, 2010, and was the first to run on a variant of iOS. The device was now housed in a very small all - black case, one - quarter the size of the original. The new model did away with an internal hard drive and had 8 GB internal flash storage, enough local storage for buffering purposes; all media was now streamed, instead of synced. The new device could also stream rented content from iTunes and video from computers or iOS devices via AirPlay. All content is drawn from online or locally connected sources.
