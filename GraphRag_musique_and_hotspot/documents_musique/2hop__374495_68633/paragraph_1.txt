The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer and highest - ranking member of the House. The Speaker's duties include maintaining order within the House, recognizing members during debate, ruling on procedural matters, appointing members to the various committees and sending bills for committee review. The Speaker pro tempore is primarily a ceremonial position, but does, by long - standing tradition, preside over the House during its consideration of local and consent bills.
