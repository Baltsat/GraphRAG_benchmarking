Drassanes is a Barcelona Metro station located underneath "Portal de la Santa Madrona", just off "La Rambla" in the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona. It is named after the nearby "Drassanes Reials de Barcelona", the old shipyards that are now the home of the "Museu Mar√≠tim de Barcelona". It is the closest station to the Port of Barcelona and one of the network's closest stations to the sea, and is served by TMB-operated Barcelona Metro line L3.
