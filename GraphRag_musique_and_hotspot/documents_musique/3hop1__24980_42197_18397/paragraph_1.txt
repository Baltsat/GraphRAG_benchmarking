Though not officially belligerent during the Korean War (1950 -- 1953), the Soviet Union played a significant, covert role in the conflict. It provided material and medical services, as well as Soviet pilots and aircraft, most notably MiG 15 fighter jets, to aid the North Korean - Chinese forces against the United Nations Forces.
