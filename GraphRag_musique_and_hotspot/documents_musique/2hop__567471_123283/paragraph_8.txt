The Walhalla Cricket Ground is a landmark in Walhalla, Victoria, Australia. Linked by a walking track from Walhalla Road, the cricket ground is perched at the top of a hill. Because there was a lack of flat ground in the township the mining community, in their spare time, carved the top off the mountain to construct a ground, this work being completed in 1882. It is claimed that the half-hour climb up the hill to reach the ground, in conjunction with the long trip to Walhalla itself, ensured a home advantage.
