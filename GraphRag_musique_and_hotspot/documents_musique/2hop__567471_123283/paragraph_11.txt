John Krasinski as Jack Ryan, an analyst working for the Central Intelligence Agency. Krasinski's interpretation of the character is said to be inspired by Ford's portrayal in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Director and executive producer Daniel Sackheim said: ``What was so great about the Harrison Ford movies was that they were about an everyman hero. He was a guy who was n't a superhero. He was heroic, but he was vulnerable. He was n't afraid to be scared. He was a regular man and a hero. ''
