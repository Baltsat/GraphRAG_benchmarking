The 1847 Colt Walker was the largest and most powerful black powder repeating handgun ever made. It was created in the mid-1840s in a collaboration between Texas Ranger Captain Samuel Hamilton Walker (1817 -- 47) and American firearms inventor Samuel Colt (1814 -- 62), building upon the earlier Colt Paterson design. Walker wanted a handgun that was extremely powerful at close range.
