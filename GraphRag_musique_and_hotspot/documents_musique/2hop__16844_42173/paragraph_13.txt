After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels very quickly reached Delhi and declared its 81 - year - old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, as Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, they also captured large tracts of the North - Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857 and Delhi by the end of September. Even so, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company - controlled India -- the Bengal Presidency, the Bombay Presidency and the Madras Presidency -- remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikhs crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states (Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir), as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the words of Governor - General Lord Canning, as ``breakwaters in a storm.
