Terry Nelson Skinner (born August 24, 1947) was an American disc jockey from Russellville, Alabama, United States. Together with a group of studio musicians, Nelson released a single in 1971 under the name C. Company featuring Terry Nelson. The single, entitled "Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley", was a spoken-word recording with a musical background which defended William Calley and the incident at My Lai, for which Calley was court-martialed in 1970-71. Originally issued on a small local label, Quickit Records, it was reissued nationally on Plantation Records in April 1971. The single reached No. 37 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 charts and No. 49 on Hot Country Songs.
