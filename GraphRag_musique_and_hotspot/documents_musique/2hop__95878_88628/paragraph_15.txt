"Britannia Hospital" is the final part of Anderson's trilogy of films, written by David Sherwin, that follow the adventures of Mick Travis (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell) as he travels through a strange and sometimes surreal Britain. From his days at boarding school in "if..." (1968) to his journey from coffee salesman to film star in "O Lucky Man!" (1973), Travis's adventures finally come to an end in "Britannia Hospital", which sees Mick as a muckraking reporter investigating the bizarre activities of Professor Millar, played by Graham Crowden, whom he had had a run-in with in "O Lucky Man". All three films have characters in common. Some of the characters from "if..." that did not turn up in "O Lucky Man" return for "Britannia Hospital".
