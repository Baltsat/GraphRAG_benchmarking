Ceville is a humorous graphic adventure video game developed by the German game studio Realmforge Studios and published by Kalypso Media. Despite the game's use of 3D environments and models, the gameplay is very true to the graphical point-and-click adventure tradition of gameplay, immortalized by game series like Monkey Island from LucasArts and the King's Quest series from Sierra Online.
