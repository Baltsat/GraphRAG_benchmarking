Rooster Cogburn is a 1975 American Western adventure film directed by Stuart Millar and starring John Wayne (in his penultimate film), reprising his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, and Katharine Hepburn. Written by Martha Hyer, based on the character Rooster Cogburn created by Charles McColl Portis in his 1968 western novel "True Grit", the film is about an aging one-eyed lawman whose badge was recently suspended for a string of routine arrests that ended in bloodshed. To earn back his badge, he is tasked with bringing down a ring of bank robbers that has hijacked a wagon shipment of nitroglycerin. He is helped by a spinster searching for her father's killer. "Rooster Cogburn" is a sequel to the 1969 film "True Grit".
