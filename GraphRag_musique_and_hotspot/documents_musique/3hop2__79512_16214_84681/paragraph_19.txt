The One Ring is an artefact that appears as the central plot element in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954 -- 55). It is described in an earlier story, The Hobbit (1937), as a magic ring of invisibility. In the sequel, The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien ascribes to the Ring a darker character, with malevolent power going far beyond conferring invisibility: it was created by Sauron the Dark Lord as part of his design to win domination over Middle - earth. The Lord of the Rings concerns the quest to destroy the Ring to keep Sauron from fulfilling his design.
