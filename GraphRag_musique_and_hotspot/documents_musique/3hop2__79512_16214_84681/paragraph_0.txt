Bret McKenzie, half of the musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords and a Wellington native, first landed a small role as an extra in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He appears sitting next to Aragorn during the council in Rivendell scene. When it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed, Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor, and Elrond proclaims the formation of the Fellowship of the Ring. The elf was dubbed ``Figwit ''by Tolkien fan Iris Hadad; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring, saying`` I will take it'', the film switches to a shot where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right, and Hadad's initial reaction was ``Frodo is grea... who is THAT?!? ''Later, Hadad corresponded with her university friend Sherry de Andres, and the two created the first Figwit fan website, www.figwitlives.net, calling him`` Legolas for the thinking woman''.
