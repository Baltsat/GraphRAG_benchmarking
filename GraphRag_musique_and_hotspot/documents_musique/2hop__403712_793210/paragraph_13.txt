Benjamin Stillingfleet was born in Wood Norton, Norfolk, in 1702 to Mary Ann and Edward Stillingfleet, a physician. He was one of four children, and the only son. His grandfather, a bishop, had died in 1699, but left no money to Benjamin's father as he disapproved of his father's opinions and his marriage.
