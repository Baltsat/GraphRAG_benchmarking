Arthur Robert Peter Baden-Powell, 2nd Baron Baden-Powell, FRSA (30 October 1913 â€“ 9 December 1962) was the son of Lieutenant-General Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, and Olave St. Clair Soames. He was also the nephew of Agnes Baden-Powell, Baden Baden-Powell, and Warington Baden-Powell, and the grandson of the Rev. Baden Powell. Peter was named Arthur after his mother's brother, Robert after his father, and Peter after Peter Pan, a character in a play by James Barrie, of whom Peter's father, the first Lord Baden-Powell, was a great fan. Likewise, Peter Baden-Powell named his daughter Wendy after another character in the play.
