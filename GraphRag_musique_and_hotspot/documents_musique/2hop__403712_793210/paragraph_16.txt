Profumo was born in London, the son of former British government minister John Profumo and his wife, actress Valerie Hobson. The Profumo family is of Italian origin. David Profumo would have succeeded his father as 6th Baron Profumo in the nobility of the Kingdom of Sardinia, if the nobility of Italy had not been legally abolished after WW2. Like his father, he does not use this title.
