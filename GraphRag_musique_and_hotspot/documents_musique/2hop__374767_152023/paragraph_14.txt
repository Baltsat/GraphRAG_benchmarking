In 1979, Musselwhite recorded "The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite" in London for Kicking Mule Records, intended to accompany an instructional book; the album became so popular that it was released on CD. In June 2008, Blind Pig Records reissued the album on 180-gram vinyl with new cover art.
