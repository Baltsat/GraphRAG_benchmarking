``This Land Is Your Land ''is one of the United States' most famous folk songs. Its lyrics were written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940, based on an existing melody, a Carter Family tune called`` When the World's on Fire'', in critical response to Irving Berlin's ``God Bless America. ''When Guthrie was tired of hearing Kate Smith sing`` God Bless America'' on the radio in the late 1930s, he sarcastically wrote ``God Blessed America for Me ''before renaming it`` This Land Is Your Land.''
