The Nissan Fuga (Japanese: 日産・フーガ "Nissan Fūga") is a mid-size luxury sedan produced by Japanese automaker Nissan since October 2004. It is built on a wider, stretched wheelbase version of the Nissan FM platform. After the Nissan Cima and Nissan President were discontinued in August 2010, the Fuga became Nissan's flagship vehicle. In North America and Europe, the Fuga is sold as the second and third-generation Infiniti M (Q70 from 2014), where it has been the flagship of the Infiniti luxury division of Nissan since 2006.
