Alfredo Ormando (15 December 1958 in San Cataldo â€“ 23 January 1998 in Rome) was a gay writer from Palermo who died as a result of setting himself on fire outside Saint Peter's Basilica. His self-immolation was an act of protest against the Roman Catholic Church's ongoing condemnation of homosexuality.
