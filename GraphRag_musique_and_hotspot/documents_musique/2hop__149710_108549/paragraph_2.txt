A Prairie Home Companion is a weekly radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician Chris Thile took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed Live from Here. A Prairie Home Companion aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other US cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue - in - cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, ``News from Lake Wobegon '', was the show's best - known feature during his long tenure.
