In the "Smallville" episode, "Absolute Justice", Hawkgirl's weaponry and mask are on display at the JSA brownstone. Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled "Shield". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode "Icarus", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.
