Trafikmagasinet ("The Traffic magazine") was a Swedish TV-show about traffic and motoring, broadcast on the Swedish public service network SVT from 1978 to 2003. Aside from reviewing new cars (which were graded by awarding "steering wheels"), "Trafikmagasinet" featured news, educational content, and consumer reports. The show was created by Carl Ingemar Perstad who also hosted the show until 2002. Christer Glenning co-hosted the show and was responsible for car testing until his death in 1998.
