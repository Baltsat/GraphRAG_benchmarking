The ballets of the late 19th Century -- particularly of those of Marius Petipa -- introduced the concept of the grand pas de deux, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of entr√©e and adagio by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale. During the 20th century, the grand pas de deux became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.
