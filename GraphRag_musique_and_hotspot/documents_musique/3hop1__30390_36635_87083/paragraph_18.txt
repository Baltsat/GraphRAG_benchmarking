The United Nations Security Council ``veto power ''refers to the power of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to veto any`` substantive'' resolution. A permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. However, the veto power does not apply to ``procedural ''votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary - General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors.
