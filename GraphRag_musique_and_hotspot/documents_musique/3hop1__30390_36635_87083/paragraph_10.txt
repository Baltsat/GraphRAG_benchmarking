Following Mark's eviction, the HouseGuests were splattered in the Everyone's A Wiener Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must brace themselves with handholds and footholds inside their hot dog bun. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Jason was the winner. For being the first two people to drop in the Head of Household competition, Kevin and Matt became Have - Nots for the week. On Day 66, the Tree of Temptation turned red. However, nobody accepted the temptation. On Day 66, Jason nominated Matt and Raven, with Matt as the target. On Day 67, Jason, Matt, Raven, Josh, Paul, and Kevin went on the lookout in the Hide and Go Veto Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had three minutes to individually hide their locked veto card in the House. Then, one at a time, HouseGuests entered the House and had one minute to attempt to find a veto card. If a HouseGuest's veto card is found, they will be eliminated, though the owner of the veto cards will not be revealed until the end of the competition. The HouseGuest who hides their veto card the best will win the Power of Veto. Jason was the winner. On Day 69, Jason decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 71, Matt broke the Have - Not rules and earned a penalty vote on eviction night. On Day 72, Matt was evicted by a 6 - 0 vote. He became the fourth member of the jury.
