Eudamidas I (Greek: Εὐδαμίδας, reigned 331 BC – c. 305 BC) was a Spartan king of the Eurypontid line, son of Archidamus III and brother of Agis III, whom he succeeded. He married the wealthy Archidamia, and they had two children, Archidamus IV and Agesistrata. There is evidence that Eudamidas I owned the half of his wife's wealth in land. His reign Sparta was a time of peace. Pausanias devotes more space to Agis II (427–400 BC) and Agesilaus II (400–360 BC) than to other kings, such as Agis III (338–330 BC) and Eudamidas I, whose lives he passed by briefly, as the Eurypontid line ‘fades’.
