In 1926, British wizard and ``magizoologist ''Newt Scamander arrives by ship to New York en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (`` No - Maj'' or ``Muggle '') who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. While Newt listens to her speech about how witches and wizards are real and dangerous, a`` Niffler'' -- a small platypus - like creature which hoards shiny objects -- escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase and slips into a nearby bank. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No - Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted Auror (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase, one of them biting Jacob on the neck.
