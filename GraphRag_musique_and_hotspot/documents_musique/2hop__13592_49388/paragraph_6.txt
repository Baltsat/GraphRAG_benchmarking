Vic Washington first starred with the CFL's Ottawa Rough Riders in 1968 and 1969, winners of back-to-back Grey Cup Championships in 1968 & 1969 against the Calgary Stampeders and the Saskatchewan Roughriders, respectively. In the first of the two title matches, Washington received the Most Valuable Player award for his game-winning 80-yard touchdown run from scrimmage, establishing a Grey Cup record that still stands. He played one more season in the CFL with the 1970 B.C.Lions before leaving for the NFL.
