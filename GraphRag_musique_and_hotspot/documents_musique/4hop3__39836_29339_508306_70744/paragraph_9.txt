From 1991 to 2005, the Braves were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times (omitting the strike - shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions), and producing the greatest pitching rotation in the history of baseball. The Braves won the NL West 1991 -- 93 and the NL East 1995 -- 2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 17 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships -- in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.
