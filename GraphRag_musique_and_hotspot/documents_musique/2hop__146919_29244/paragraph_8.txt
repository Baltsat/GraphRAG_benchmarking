The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and Beauvais-Till√©. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014. There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows.
