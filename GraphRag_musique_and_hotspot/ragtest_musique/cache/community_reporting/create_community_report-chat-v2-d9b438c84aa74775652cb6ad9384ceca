It was formed in 1922 when Armenia became part of the Soviet Union, and it remained so until declaring independence in 1991. The Soviet Union was a union of republics that faced dissolution in the post-Cold War era, eventually leading to its collapse. During its existence, the Soviet Union was involved in several significant events, including the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a neutrality agreement with Nazi Germany, and the Warsaw Pact, which it played a key role in creating and maintaining. In an attempt to restructure the state, Gorbachev sought to transform the Soviet Union into a federation of independent republics.
