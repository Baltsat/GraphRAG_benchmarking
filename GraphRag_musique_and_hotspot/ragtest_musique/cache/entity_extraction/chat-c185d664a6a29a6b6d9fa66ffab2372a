Other major cities include Austin, the second most populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso. Texas is nicknamed ``The Lone Star State ''to signify its former status as an independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The`` Lone Star'' can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texan state seal. The origin of Texas's name is from the word ``Tejas, ''which means`` friends'' in the Caddo language.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3:70b-instruct-q6_K", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
