Using the Eurofest 2007 format on 15 December 2006, televoting narrowed down fifteen performers to Dmitry Koldun, selected by televoting, and Diana Gurtskaya and The Project, selected by the professional jury. The three competitors entered the superfinal where they could change their song if they wished. On 22 January 2007, the three performed their song in front of a strict government jury, which decided that Dmitry Koldun was the most suitable performer to represent Belarus. The song was written by Karen Kavaleryan and composed by Philip Kirkorov.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3:70b-instruct-q6_K", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
