{"id":"0681ae66b1c9386c27f0406eb19628cd","chunk":"An electric field is a field that surrounds electric charges. It represents charges attracting or repelling other electric charges by exerting force. Mathematically the electric field is a vector field that associates to each point in space the force, called the Coulomb force, that would be experienced per unit of charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point. The units of the electric field in the SI system are newtons per coulomb (N \/ C), or volts per meter (V \/ m). Electric fields are created by electric charges, and by time - varying magnetic fields. Electric fields are important in many areas of physics, and are exploited practically in electrical technology. On an atomic scale, the electric field is responsible for the attractive force between the atomic nucleus and electrons that holds atoms together, and the forces between atoms that cause chemical bonding. The electric field and the magnetic field together form the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.","chunk_id":"0681ae66b1c9386c27f0406eb19628cd","document_ids":["398d513021df7b31ce918a5877c8beb0"],"n_tokens":193,"entities":[{"name":"\"COULOMB

{"id":"12bd99f0db34d702fc89b4ddfb3b996c","chunk":"The nucleus was discovered in 1911, as a result of Ernest Rutherford's efforts to test Thomson's ``plum pudding model ''of the atom. The electron had already been discovered earlier by J.J. Thomson himself. Knowing that atoms are electrically neutral, Thomson postulated that there must be a positive charge as well. In his plum pudding model, Thomson suggested that an atom consisted of negative electrons randomly scattered within a sphere of positive charge. Ernest Rutherford later devised an experiment with his research partner Hans Geiger and with help of Ernest Marsden, that involved the deflection of alpha particles (helium nuclei) directed at a thin sheet of metal foil. He reasoned that if Thomson's model were correct, the positively charged alpha particles would easily pass through the foil with very little deviation in their paths, as the foil should act as electrically neutral if the negative and positive charges are so intimately mixed as to make it appear neutral. To his surprise, many of the particles were deflected at very large angles. Because the mass of an alpha particle is about 8000 times that of an electron, it became apparent that a very strong force must be present if it could deflect the massive and fast moving alpha particles. He realized that the plum pudding model could not be accurate and that the deflections of the alpha particles could only be explained if the positive and negative charges were separated from each other and that the mass of the atom was a concentrated point of positive charge. This justified the idea of a nuclear atom with a dense center of positive charge and mass.","chunk_id":"12bd99f0db34d702fc89b4ddfb3b996c","document_ids":["966d7c7cb0bb3aa199c02024eedb3fc8"],"n_tokens":315,"entities":[{"name":"\"J.J.

This was before the discovery of the particle by J.J. Thomson in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as ``elementary charge '',`` fundamental unit of charge'', or simply as ``e ''. A measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge e, even if at large scales charge seems to behave as a real quantity. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging of a capacitor, or in the fractional quantum Hall effect.","chunk_id":"fd4780b37d8c459e004282c34eee4e0d","document_ids":["cd926c5a4f0fb4180d573dbd117002d8"],"n_tokens":136,"entities":[{"name":"\"J.J.
