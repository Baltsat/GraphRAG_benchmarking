Several sources indicate that there were actually three versions, with this one being the last. The name Rondanini refers to the fact that the sculpture stood for centuries in the courtyard at the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome. Certain sources point out that biographer Giorgio Vasari had referred to this Piet\u00e0 in 1550, suggesting that the first version may already have been underway at that time. The work is now in the Museum of Rondanini Piet\u00e0 of Sforza Castle in Milan.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

From Lewis Hallam's early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest, and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. He was the third of four sons including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Klemens Philipp Friedrich Justinian, the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. His mother was Caroline Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg, n\u00e9e Gr\u00e4fin von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gr\u00e4fin von Hohenthal.The titles \"Graf\" and \"Gr\u00e4fin\" mean count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which was Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility. Article 109 also stated, \"Legal privileges or disadvantages based on birth or social standing are to be abolished. Noble titles form part of the name only; noble titles may not be granted any more.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac. Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet all\u00e9gorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\". Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince. The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"op\u00e9ra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French \"fanfare\" (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern \"\"guinche\"\" (slang for \"\"guinguette\"\") appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French \"fanfare\" (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern \"\"guinche\"\" (slang for \"\"guinguette\"\") appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

From Lewis Hallam's early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest, and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac. Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet all\u00e9gorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\". Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince. The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"op\u00e9ra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. He was the third of four sons including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Klemens Philipp Friedrich Justinian, the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. His mother was Caroline Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg, n\u00e9e Gr\u00e4fin von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gr\u00e4fin von Hohenthal.The titles \"Graf\" and \"Gr\u00e4fin\" mean count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which was Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility. Article 109 also stated, \"Legal privileges or disadvantages based on birth or social standing are to be abolished. Noble titles form part of the name only; noble titles may not be granted any more.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. He was the third of four sons including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Klemens Philipp Friedrich Justinian, the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. His mother was Caroline Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg, n\u00e9e Gr\u00e4fin von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gr\u00e4fin von Hohenthal.The titles \"Graf\" and \"Gr\u00e4fin\" mean count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which was Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility.

The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac. Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet all\u00e9gorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\". Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince. The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"op\u00e9ra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French \"fanfare\" (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern \"\"guinche\"\" (slang for \"\"guinguette\"\") appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac. Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet all\u00e9gorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\". Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince. The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"op\u00e9ra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. He was the third of four sons including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Klemens Philipp Friedrich Justinian, the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. His mother was Caroline Schenk Gr\u00e4fin von Stauffenberg, n\u00e9e Gr\u00e4fin von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gr\u00e4fin von Hohenthal.The titles \"Graf\" and \"Gr\u00e4fin\" mean count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which was Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility. Article 109 also stated, \"Legal privileges or disadvantages based on birth or social standing are to be abolished.
