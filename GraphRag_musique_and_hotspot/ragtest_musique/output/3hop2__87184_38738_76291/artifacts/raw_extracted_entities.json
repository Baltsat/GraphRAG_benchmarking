{"id":"41c446f116ec4f63db8f427893492640","chunk":"The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660. By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right. The English Bill of Rights 1689 had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament. Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. Parliament initially contended that the colonists had virtual representation, but the idea ``found little support on either side of the Atlantic ''. John Dunmore Lang wrote in 1852,`` The person who first suggested the idea (of Parliamentary representation for the colonies) appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I. It was afterwards put forward with approbation by the celebrated Dr. Adam Smith, and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Dr. Benjamin Franklin.''","chunk_id":"41c446f116ec4f63db8f427893492640","document_ids":["034dbb700fc34f3faec2d7dcd7a4efe1"],"n_tokens":184,"entities":[{"name":"\"JOHN DUNMORE LANG\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"John Dunmore Lang is a person who wrote about the idea of Parliamentary representation for the colonies in 1852.\"","source_id":"41c446f116ec4f63db8f427893492640"},{"name":"\"OLDMIXON\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Oldmixon is an American annalist who first suggested the idea of Parliamentary representation for the colonies during the era of Queen Anne or George I.\"","source_id":"41c446f116ec4f63db8f427893492640"},{"name":"\"DR.

It guarantees civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, religious and cultural freedom and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo Warranto. Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process. However, in case of fundamental rights violation, the Supreme Court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man.","chunk_id":"1bb823adfc809a1b59967e7b2cf2ea38","document_ids":["0d16f40af551b10d91615017a08950e2"],"n_tokens":309,"entities":[{"name":"\"INDIA\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"India is a

It guarantees civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law freedom of speech and expression, religious and cultural freedom and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo Warranto. Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process. However, in case of fundamental rights violation, Supreme court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of

The bill passed first and second reading in Nigeria's Parliament and was presented to Committee on Constitutional Review. For any constitutional amendments to become a law in Nigeria, the amendments needed to be presented to all the House of Assemblies of 36 states of federation and not less than 24 states are expected to vote Yes to the amendments.

The Speaker of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders earn more: $223,500 for the Speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders). A cost - of - living - adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes to not accept it. Congress sets members' salaries; however, the Twenty - seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary (but not COLA) from taking effect until after the next election of the whole House. Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years. Outside pay is limited to 15% of congressional pay, and certain types of income involving a fiduciary responsibility or personal endorsement are prohibited.","chunk_id":"3b75e55d7fd9a3f39f555852b1fbd45c","document_ids":["7510c537f54b227f1ef8f20a17dcf918"],"n_tokens":163,"entities":[{"name":"\"SPEAKER OF THE

Roosevelt's New Deal legislative program. Section 7 (a) of the bill, which protected collective bargaining rights for unions, proved contentious (especially in the Senate), but both chambers eventually passed the legislation. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The Act had two main sections (or ``titles ''). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, authorizing the promulgation of industrial codes of fair competition, guaranteed trade union rights, permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined petroleum products and their transportation. Title II established the Public Works Administration, outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in. Title II also provided funding for the Act.","chunk_id":"0ae0bbc4de3199eee3201274f8f07cb8","document_ids":["8f851ff9f90a7c3193c32c6f661ddd04"],"n_tokens":166,"entities":[{"name":"\"UNITED STATES\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"The United States is the country where the legislation was enacted during the Great Depression.\"\n\"The United States is a country where Tucson, Pima County, and Arizona are located.\"","source_id":"0ae0bbc4de3199eee3201274f8f07cb8","entity_type":"\"GEO\""},{"name":"\"NEW DEAL\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The New Deal was a legislative program initiated by President Franklin D.

It guarantees civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law freedom of speech and expression, religious and cultural freedom and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo Warranto. Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process. However, in case of fundamental rights violation, Supreme court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32.

The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state to state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in nearby India and on the islands that are now Indonesia. The Qing response, successful for a time, was in 1756 to establish the Canton System, which restricted maritime trade to that city and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their
