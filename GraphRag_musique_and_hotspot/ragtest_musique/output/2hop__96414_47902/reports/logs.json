Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first \"Bourne\" novel, \"The Bourne Legacy\", the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first \"Bourne\" novel, \"The Bourne Legacy\", the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first \"Bourne\" novel, \"The Bourne Legacy\", the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first \"Bourne\" novel, \"The Bourne Legacy\", the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
