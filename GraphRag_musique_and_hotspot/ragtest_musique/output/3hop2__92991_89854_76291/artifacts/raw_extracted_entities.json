{"id":"5e0fef04d6763b93c3162b9fa9bc6b03","chunk":"The Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States as President of the United States Senate. The Constitution also calls for a President pro tempore to serve as the leader of the body when the President of the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President pro tempore -- customarily the most senior (longest - serving) Senator in the majority party -- actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior Senators of the majority party. Since the Vice President may be of a different party than the majority and is not a member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role. For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate. This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.","chunk_id":"5e0fef04d6763b93c3162b9fa9bc6b03","document_ids":["04de9d5088b95e29c12d415dbfdb3c79"],"n_tokens":200,"entities":[{"name":"\"PRESIDENT PRO

A cost - of - living - adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes to not accept it.

{"id":"4519601cd0420b1a1649441f6f474a6d","chunk":"The prosperous Shang dynasty saw its rule filled with many outstanding accomplishments. Notably, the dynasty lasted for a considerable time during which 31 kings ruled over an extended period of 17 generations. During this period, the dynasty enjoyed a period of peace and tranquility in which citizens could make a good living. The government was originally able to control most of its internal affairs due to the firm support provided by the people. As time went on, however, the rulers' abuse of the other social classes led to social unrest and instability. The corruption in this dynasty created the conditions necessary for a new ruling house to rise -- the Zhou dynasty. Rebellion against the Shang was led by Zhou Wu. They created the Mandate of Heaven to explain their right to assume rule and presumed that the only way to hold the mandate was to rule well in the eyes of Heaven. They believed that the Shang ruling house had become morally corrupt, and that the Shang leaders' loss of virtue entitled their own house to take over. The overthrow of the Shang Dynasty, they said, was in accordance with the mandate given by Heaven.","chunk_id":"4519601cd0420b1a1649441f6f474a6d","document_ids":["767c63543c65bdd8f9d28cb3fcbb55a3"],"n_tokens":225,"entities":[{"name":"\"ZHOU WU\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Zhou Wu

It is recognized by the state of Oregon as a major political party, along with the Oregon Republican Party. The State Central Committee, made up of two delegates elected from each of Oregon's 36 counties and one additional delegate for every 15,000 registered Democrats, is the main authoritative body of the party. After Oregon was admitted into the Union in 1859, the Democratic party controlled the state. Oregon elected twice as many Democrats as Republicans between 1859 and 1879 in statewide elections for governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, and congressmen. The party holds 38 members in the State House that has 60 representatives total, and 18 members in the State Senate, out of 30 delegates total. The party also holds the Governor's office (Kate Brown), Attorney General (Ellen Rosenblum), Labor Commissioner (Val Hoyle), and State Treasurer (Tobias Read). The Democrats also have both U.S senate positions in their state and send four of the five U.S House representatives from Oregon to D.C.","chunk_id":"8d58dd0e6783d0552627cc325dce2d9d","document_ids":["8fdd09d2582112739b171c9f05ad4f43"],"n_tokens":234,"entities":[{"name":"\"OREGON REPUBLICAN

In reference to revenue bills, the Constitution also states that the ``Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. ''As with revenue bills, the Senate and House each drafts and considers its own appropriation bill. The Senate then`` cuts - and - pastes,'' substituting the language of its version of a particular appropriation bill for the language of the House bill, then agrees to the bill as amended.","chunk_id":"71eece064595e49c2f1923920d9ec129","document_ids":["e7025256bd021e541ac89d8a877ba7a1"],"n_tokens":161,"entities":[{"name":"\"HOUSE OF
