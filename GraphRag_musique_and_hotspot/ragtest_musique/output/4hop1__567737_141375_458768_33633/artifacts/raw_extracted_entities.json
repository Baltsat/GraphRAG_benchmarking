The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Cresp\u00ed on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs (Serra Springs), that were reminiscent of the tears that Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.","chunk_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7","document_ids":["2e7ba7f71a99e4d891562a6de3a5bfbe"],"n_tokens":165,"entities":[{"name":"\"TONGVA PEOPLE\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Tongva people are an indigenous group that originally inhabited Santa Monica, with their own language and culture.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"GASPAR DE PORTOL\u00c0\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 is an explorer who led the first non-indigenous group to set foot in Santa Monica in 1769.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"SAINT MONICA\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Saint Monica is a historical figure, mother of Saint Augustine, whose feast day may have inspired the naming of Santa Monica.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"JUAN CRESP\u00cd\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Juan Cresp\u00ed is a person who named Santa Monica, possibly due to the resemblance of local springs to Saint Monica's tears.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"SANTA MONICA\"","type":"","description":"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"PIMA COUNTY\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Pima County is a county in Arizona, United States, with Tucson as its county seat.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The University of Arizona is an educational institution located in Tucson, Arizona.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"ARIZONA\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Arizona is a state in the United States, where Tucson and Phoenix are located.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"PHOENIX\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Phoenix is a city in Arizona, United States, and the largest populated city in the state.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"UNITED STATES\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"The United States is a country where Tucson, Pima County, and Arizona are located.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"U.S.-MEXICO BORDER\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"The U.S.-Mexico border is an international border between the United States and Mexico, located near Tucson.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"OPTICS VALLEY\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Optics Valley is a nickname for Tucson due to its involvement in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"MEXICO\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Mexico is a country that shares an international border with the United States, near Tucson.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"COUNTY SEAT\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"A county seat is an administrative center for a county, such as Pima County.\"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"},{"name":"\"TUCSON\"","type":"","description":"","source_id":"a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;TONGVA PEOPLE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Tongva people are an indigenous group that originally inhabited Santa Monica, with their own language and culture.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">a5e00956775d7de209480dbdb038a9b7<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;GASPAR DE PORTOL&#192;&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Gaspar de Portol&#224;

{"id":"6d04595b3a27e3744d341daba0572f9b","chunk":"Just Be Free is a demo album released by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on \"The New Mickey Mouse Club\", a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music with the understanding that they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and \"Just Be Free\" has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.","chunk_id":"6d04595b3a27e3744d341daba0572f9b","document_ids":["6babffd77086a36e9de52b9048795256"],"n_tokens":212,"entities":[{"name":"\"WARLOCK
