Measuring 3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine of any major city on Earth. Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States. On average, there are 107 days annually with a high of at least 100 \u00b0 F (38 \u00b0 C) including most days from late May through early October. Highs top 110 \u00b0 F (43 \u00b0 C) an average of 18 days during the year. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all - time recorded high of 122 \u00b0 F (50 \u00b0 C). Despite the city's claim to the most extreme heat in summer, however, it does not have the highest average annual temperature in the contiguous United States. In that respect, it comes second to Miami; Phoenix has an average daily temperature of 75 \u00b0 F (24 \u00b0 C), compared to Miami's 77 \u00b0 F (25 \u00b0 C).\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), but can drop below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) with severe wind chills. In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s \u00b0C (70s \u00b0F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 \u00b0C (77 to 86 \u00b0F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Owing to its position on the Romanian Plain, the city's winters can get windy, though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation. Winter temperatures often dip below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), sometimes even to \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). In summer, the average temperature is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) (the average for July and August). Temperatures frequently reach 35 to 40 \u00b0C (95 to 104 \u00b0F) in midsummer in the city centre. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer are low, occasional heavy storms occur. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between 17 and 22 \u00b0C (63 and 72 \u00b0F), and precipitation during spring tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), but can drop below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) with severe wind chills. In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s \u00b0C (70s \u00b0F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 \u00b0C (77 to 86 \u00b0F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).\n######################\nOutput:"}}
