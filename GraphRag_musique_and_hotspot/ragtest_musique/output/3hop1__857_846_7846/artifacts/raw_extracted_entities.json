The Treaty marks the political and constitutional involvement and the beginning of British rule in India. Based on the terms of the agreement, Alam granted the East India Company Diwani rights, or the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Emperor from the eastern province of Bengal - Bihar - Orissa. Thus East India Company got appointed as the imperial tax collector for the Eastern province (Bengal - Bihar - Orissa). These rights allowed the Company to collect revenue directly from the people of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. In return, the Company paid an annual tribute of twenty - six lakhs of rupees (equal to 260,000 pounds sterling) while securing for Shah Alam II the districts of Kora and Allahabad. The tribute money paid to the emperor was for the maintenance of the Emperor's court in Allahabad. The accord also dictated that Shah Alam be restored to the province of Varanasi as long as he continued to pay certain amount of revenue to the Company. Awadh was returned to Shuja - ud - Daulah, but Allahabad and Kora were taken from him. The Nawab of Awadh also had to pay fifty - three lakhs of rupees as war indemnity to the East India Company.","chunk_id":"28b7ee1d87b52c24ff2ff3f881c2d48b","document_ids":["1864eb09dce2d53121e0b431be29ee35"],"n_tokens":317,"entities":[{"name":"\"ROBERT, LORD

To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the \"Chronicon Athanasianum\" (XXXV) as a \"philosopher\", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.","chunk_id":"e17ba11cad191e2e3d714da84e930089","document_ids":["1d4b79b18d2a1db1e3eaa193a98ba569"],"n_tokens":226,"entities":[{"name":"\"JULIAN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Julian

This brought an end to over 2,000 years of Imperial China and began an extended period of instability of warlord factionalism. The unorganized political and economic systems combined with a widespread criticism of Chinese culture led to questioning and doubt about the future. In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo in 1932, with Puyi, as the emperor.

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.","chunk_id":"e31694bfa82b38b9ad97b051015fb758","document_ids":["a1c809048928a425280b153a6d74af8d"],"n_tokens":195,"entities":[{"name":"\"YONGLE

{"id":"c19bbc5d46b4e9e0095f2e4ad9b75f7f","chunk":"Some scholars note that Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in civil war and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r. 1260\u20131294) and his spiritual superior Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa (1235\u20131280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402\u20131424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384\u20131415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.","chunk_id":"c19bbc5d46b4e9e0095f2e4ad9b75f7f","document_ids":["d47dfc82fc67c2ee03d81065a134b698"],"n_tokens":206,"entities":[{"name":"\"MING
