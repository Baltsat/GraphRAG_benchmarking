The J30 went into production on April 7, 1992 as a 1993 model to replace the M30 (which was a coupe), and was launched in the United States after its competitor, the Lexus GS. The car was designed to slot between the smaller G20 and the larger Q45, as Infiniti's first mid-size sedan to compete directly with the Acura Legend. Also, it was fairly small but featured rounded styling uncharacteristic of the crowded executive car class, that is now reminiscent of a four-door coup\u00e9. Chief designer for the J30 was Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International (NDI) and exterior designer Doug Wilson in 1988-1989. Design work was frozen in 1989. In a promotional video produced in 1994, it was referred to as a \"personal luxury sedan\" as attempt to define it as a four-door coup\u00e9. It has the round looks of the Nissan Altima/Bluebird U13.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
