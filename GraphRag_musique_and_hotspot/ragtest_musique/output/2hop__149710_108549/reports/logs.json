The series, initially broadcast by The WB, premiered on October 16, 2001. After \"Smallville\"s fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster. \"Smallville\", which ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011, follows Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes known as Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five \"Smallville\" ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the \"Daily Planet\" and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled \"Shield\". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode \"Icarus\", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

A Prairie Home Companion aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other US cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue - in - cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor.

Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled \"Shield\". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode \"Icarus\", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The show's first season, The Joe Schmo Show, aired in 2003, and its second season, Joe Schmo 2, aired in 2004. The first season's hoax was conducted as a typical reality competition show while the second hoax was a \"Bachelor\"-like dating series.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled \"Shield\". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode \"Icarus\", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The series, initially broadcast by The WB, premiered on October 16, 2001. After \"Smallville\"s fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster. \"Smallville\", which ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011, follows Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes known as Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five \"Smallville\" ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the \"Daily Planet\" and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In 2016, musician Chris Thile took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed Live from Here. A Prairie Home Companion aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other US cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue - in - cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, ``News from Lake Wobegon '', was the show's best - known feature during his long tenure.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The series was broadcast in the U.S. on the cable network Spike. The show's premise is that a target person or people are led to believe that they are contestants on a reality television show; in reality, all of the other participants in the purported show \u2013 including the host \u2013 are actors, and their actions and the outcome of the purported show are all scripted in an attempt to elicit comedic reactions from the targets. The show's first season, The Joe Schmo Show, aired in 2003, and its second season, Joe Schmo 2, aired in 2004. The first season's hoax was conducted as a typical reality competition show while the second hoax was a \"Bachelor\"-like dating series.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled \"Shield\". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode \"Icarus\", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The series, initially broadcast by The WB, premiered on October 16, 2001. After \"Smallville\"s fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster. \"Smallville\", which ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011, follows Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes known as Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five \"Smallville\" ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the \"Daily Planet\" and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The series was broadcast in the U.S. on the cable network Spike. The show's premise is that a target person or people are led to believe that they are contestants on a reality television show; in reality, all of the other participants in the purported show \u2013 including the host \u2013 are actors, and their actions and the outcome of the purported show are all scripted in an attempt to elicit comedic reactions from the targets. The show's first season, The Joe Schmo Show, aired in 2003, and its second season, Joe Schmo 2, aired in 2004. The first season's hoax was conducted as a typical reality competition show while the second hoax was a \"Bachelor\"-like dating series.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The series, initially broadcast by The WB, premiered on October 16, 2001. After \"Smallville\"s fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster. \"Smallville\", which ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011, follows Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes known as Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five \"Smallville\" ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the \"Daily Planet\" and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
