This practice is considered exploitative by many international organisations. Legislation across the world prohibit child labour. These laws do not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, certain categories of work such as those by Amish

Students are also exposed to mathematics and language arts. Since it is a magnet school, there is no district boundary placed by the school district, meaning any high school age student within the Wichita city limits, can attend the school without requiring a

{"id":"61f1deefd4f4e4b5efcf45360665a5fb","chunk":"Andr\u00e9 S. Dreiding (22 June 1919 in Z\u00fcrich \u2013 24 December 2013 in Herrliberg near Zurich) was a Swiss chemist. He finished his high school studies in Z\u00fcrich and then studied at Columbia University in New York where he was awarded BS and MS degrees. After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952. In 1954, Dreiding turned to Switzerland and University of Zurich, where he became professor, and stayed until his retirement in 1987, after which he has been emeritus professor.","chunk_id":"61f1deefd4f4e4b5efcf45360665a5fb","document_ids":["8fc72b37e2a957391a48596cb041fffa"],"n_tokens":226,"entities":[{"name":"\"COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"Columbia University is an educational institution in New York where Andr\u00e9 S.

His extra-curricular activities included track and pole vaulting, and he served as vice-president of the Outing Club. He later enrolled in the innovative Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education (Antioch University New England) Master's degree program and in 1972 was awarded a Ph.D in education from Harvard University. Coperthwaite's Harvard research examined the process of instructing groups of students on yurt construction. His dissertation was on native Alaskan culture. One of the many yurts he built leading student groups (in 1976 on the new campus of World College West in Marin County, California) became the subject of a student-composed song; \"Yurt Fever\". Its final verse concluded with \"...a person can stray all over the place, but a Yurt is always a

{"id":"3dd765f23cf5c0b0abb0778fa1c9aece","chunk":"The main campus in Provo, Utah, United States sits on approximately 560 acres (2.3 km2) nestled at the base of the Wasatch Mountains and includes 295 buildings. The buildings feature a wide variety of architectural styles, each building being built in the style of its time. The grass, trees, and flower beds on BYU's campus are impeccably maintained. Furthermore, views of the Wasatch Mountains, (including Mount Timpanogos) can be seen from the campus. BYU's Harold B. Lee Library (also known as \"HBLL\"), which The Princeton Review ranked as the No. 1 \"Great College Library\" in 2004, has approximately 8\u00bd million items in its collections, contains 98 miles (158 km) of shelving, and can seat 4,600 people. The Spencer W. Kimball Tower, shortened to SWKT and pronounced Swicket by many students, is home to several of the university's departments and programs and is the tallest building in Provo, Utah. Furthermore, BYU's Marriott Center, used as a basketball arena, can seat over 22,000 and is one of the largest on-campus arenas in the nation. Interestingly absent on the campus of this church owned university is a campus chapel. Notwithstanding, each Sunday LDS Church services for students are conducted on campus, but due to the large number of students attending these services, nearly all of the buildings and possible meeting spaces on campus are utilized (in addition, many students attend services off campus in LDS chapels in the surrounding communities).","chunk_id":"3dd765f23cf5c0b0abb0778fa1c9aece","document_ids":["ea59fe15e68f0372500ee9b79ed324aa"],"n_tokens":318,"entities":[{"name":"\"HAROLD B.

Graduates who are exempted from the service include those above the age of thirty (30) and those with physical disability, therefore completing the service year entitles one to employment. During the service year, Corps members have the opportunity of learning of the cultures of other people, an opportunity many Nigerians never get in their lifetime. The program has also helped in creating entry - level jobs for many Nigerian youth. An NYSC forum dedicated to the NYSC members was built to bridge the gap amongst members serving across Nigeria and also an avenue for corpers to share job information and career resources as well as getting loans from the National Directorate Of Employment.","chunk_id":"d3419d8b915bd66d4ebc26c9ac3fb814","document_ids":["f9441b6f53307edaaffa24e63643c1e7"],"n_tokens":157,"entities":[{"name":"\"NATIONAL DIRECTORATE OF
