It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006. In 2018, it changed its name to Orano Cycle to reflect the restructuring of Areva.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Founded in 1979, it was one of the companies that produced the \"passenger-utility\" type of vehicle popular in Greece at the time for tax categorization reasons. Its creators were former executives of \"Autokinitoviomihania Ellados\" (meaning 'Greek Car Industry') a company founded in 1975 to also produce vehicles of this type \u2013 it assembled Italian Fissore models based on Fiat products, as well as other Fiat models and variants. Automeccanica followed a different path, building the \"Zebra\" model, a passenger-utility car based on the \"Daihatsu Charade\", as well as assembling the \"Charade\" itself. In 1985, when the law favoring the \"Zebra\"-type vehicles changed, Automeccanica stopped its production (after about 2,000 units had been built) and started licence production of the Soviet Lada Niva model, while it developed its own cabrio-version of the car. In 1988 it acquired its former \"father\" company, \"Autokinitoviomihania Ellados\" and the latter's factory in Thiva. Automeccanica went out of the car-construction business in 1995.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In 1985, when the law favoring the \"Zebra\"-type vehicles changed, Automeccanica stopped its production (after about 2,000 units had been built) and started licence production of the Soviet Lada Niva model, while it developed its own cabrio-version of the car. In 1988 it acquired its former \"father\" company, \"Autokinitoviomihania Ellados\" and the latter's factory in Thiva.

It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006. In 2018, it changed its name to Orano Cycle to reflect the restructuring of Areva.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Founded in 1979, it was one of the companies that produced the \"passenger-utility\" type of vehicle popular in Greece at the time for tax categorization reasons. Its creators were former executives of \"Autokinitoviomihania Ellados\" (meaning 'Greek Car Industry') a company founded in 1975 to also produce vehicles of this type \u2013 it assembled Italian Fissore models based on Fiat products, as well as other Fiat models and variants. Automeccanica followed a different path, building the \"Zebra\" model, a passenger-utility car based on the \"Daihatsu Charade\", as well as assembling the \"Charade\" itself. In 1985, when the law favoring the \"Zebra\"-type vehicles changed, Automeccanica stopped its production (after about 2,000 units had been built) and started licence production of the Soviet Lada Niva model, while it developed its own cabrio-version of the car. In 1988 it acquired its former \"father\" company, \"Autokinitoviomihania Ellados\" and the latter's factory in Thiva.

The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006.

It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006. In 2018, it changed its name to Orano Cycle to reflect the restructuring of Areva.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006.

The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006. In 2018, it changed its name to Orano Cycle to reflect the restructuring of Areva.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is the main subsidiary of Orano S.A. The company was created in 1976 from the production division of the French government's CEA (English: \"Atomic Energy Commission\"). It is an industrial group active in all stages of the uranium fuel cycle, including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and recycling. In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie to form the larger group Areva; the subsidiary's name was changed to \"Areva NC\" in March 2006.
