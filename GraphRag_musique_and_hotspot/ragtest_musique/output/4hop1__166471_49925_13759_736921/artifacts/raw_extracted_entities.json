{"id":"828a09874dfe5ab3f137afb526fb8a76","chunk":"Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name \"Paul\" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.","chunk_id":"828a09874dfe5ab3f137afb526fb8a76","document_ids":["1b0e7fc1f2664de29ea5f3e8486048b4"],"n_tokens":302,"entities":[{"name":"\"JOHN XXIII\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"John XXIII was the predecessor of Paul VI, whose death automatically closed the Second Vatican Council.\"","source_id":"828a09874dfe5ab3f137afb526fb8a76"},{"name":"\"APOSTLE ST.

The restoration of papal authority was celebrated by the majority of the nation and enforced by the Marian persecutions against Protestants.

The English it seems were quite caught up with the reforming movement on the Continent. At the time they were neither Calvinist nor Lutheran, but certainly leaning toward Protestantism (and by the late 16th century, were certainly Protestant).","chunk_id":"15d6f7e21e0589423b378920f3c8ddb7","document_ids":["5d2b57697e846cea1717f1f9d62dc0a0"],"n_tokens":138,"entities":[{"name":"\"QUEEN MARY

{"id":"896a702a29cd9f47d5911569ee25d90e","chunk":"Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:","chunk_id":"896a702a29cd9f47d5911569ee25d90e","document_ids":["b6355f58a6b3da2f58a86685cca0d059"],"n_tokens":377,"entities":[{"name":"\"POPE PIUS

{"id":"b4ba0c3a1fb1b9efeee0cb4cef676604","chunk":"Luke -- Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it. Luke -- Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or ``apology ''for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law. On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews, and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah.","chunk_id":"b4ba0c3a1fb1b9efeee0cb4cef676604","document_ids":["d47122753770222ac2baba728e8e8273"],"n_tokens":183,"entities":[{"name":"\"JESUS\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Jesus is

{"id":"cae8a505bc47dbdc5e9ddb521bce3e1a","chunk":"Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.","chunk_id":"cae8a505bc47dbdc5e9ddb521bce3e1a","document_ids":["e4fbbec82367392c77f261274fefa3fe"],"n_tokens":220,"entities":[{"name":"\"JAN HUS\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Jan

The objective is to start a regular \"Bible study\" with any person who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members. Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching. They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly \"Field Service Report\". Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed \"irregular\" and may be counseled by elders; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed \"inactive\".","chunk_id":"6e5be2f5718b612e18ac2b1834bf0832","document_ids":["f94cb8a4909b873f3f0f2da48ffdf709"],"n_tokens":178,"entities":[{"name":"\"WATCH TOWER
