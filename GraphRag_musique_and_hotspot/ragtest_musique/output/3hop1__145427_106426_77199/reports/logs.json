It was formulated an hour after the Infamy Speech of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Japan had sent a message for the United States to its embassy in Washington earlier, but because of problems at the embassy in decoding the very long message -- the high security level assigned to the declaration meant that only personnel with very high clearances could decode it, which slowed down the process -- it was not delivered to the U.S. Secretary of State until after the Pearl Harbor attack. Following the U.S. declaration, Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States, bringing the United States fully into World War II.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is part of the macroregion of Baj\u00edo. It is 274 km (170 mi) from Mexico City, 86 km (53 mi) from Queretaro, and 97 km (60 mi) from the state capital of Guanajuato. Historically, the town is important as being the birthplace of Mexican General Ignacio Allende, whose surname was added to the town's name in 1826, as well as the first municipality declared independent of Spanish rule by the nascent insurgent army during the Mexican War of Independence. San Miguel de Allende was also a critical epicenter during the historic Chichimeca War (1540 - 1590) where the Chichimeca Confederation defeated the Spanish Empire in the initial colonization war. Today, the town is a proclaimed World Heritage Site, attracting thousands of tourists and new residents from abroad every year.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It is part of the macroregion of Baj\u00edo. It is 274 km (170 mi) from Mexico City, 86 km (53 mi) from Queretaro, and 97 km (60 mi) from the state capital of Guanajuato. Historically, the town is important as being the birthplace of Mexican General Ignacio Allende, whose surname was added to the town's name in 1826, as well as the first municipality declared independent of Spanish rule by the nascent insurgent army during the Mexican War of Independence. San Miguel de Allende was also a critical epicenter during the historic Chichimeca War (1540 - 1590) where the Chichimeca Confederation defeated the Spanish Empire in the initial colonization war. Today, the town is a proclaimed World Heritage Site, attracting thousands of tourists and new residents from abroad every year.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Under these circumstances, the Germans had to continue the war, yet could not pin down any proper military opposition in their vicinity. As the bulk of the remaining French armies were digging-in near Paris, the German leaders decided to put pressure upon the enemy by attacking Paris. By September 15, German troops reached the outskirts of the fortified city. On September 19, the Germans surrounded it and erected a blockade, as already established at Metz.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
