The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, de facto leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party. Neither does the Speaker regularly participate in floor debates nor

Despite the variability of these factors, there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position. Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book. Others have devolved upon the position in other ways. To be sure, the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources\u2014beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative\u2014to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions. Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader, because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda, partisan ratios on committees, staff resources, administrative operations, and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities.","chunk_id":"52b7d939e00921ff27a0e23527849f4d","document_ids":["354556ce33f6de3bf1c4528c77531764"],"n_tokens":192,"entities":[{"name":"\"WHITE

The main cause was opposition to the Kansas -- Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting of the general ``anti-Nebraska ''movement where the name`` Republican'' was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854, in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party.","chunk_id":"89d290e1a2eaf5e23dbbb32649e440b7","document_ids":["551a4a8bc24840f926d1c35c12c9f24f"],"n_tokens":153,"entities":[],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\" \/><\/graphml>"}
