The Seine d\u00e9partement had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity. This problem was 'resolved' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\" (Paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three departments surrounding it. The Paris region was renamed \"\u00cele-de-France\" in 1977, but the \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today. Paris was reunited with its suburbs on January 1, 2016 when the M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris came into existence.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
