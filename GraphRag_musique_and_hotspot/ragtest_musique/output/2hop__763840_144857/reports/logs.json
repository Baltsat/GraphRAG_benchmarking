After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department. Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered $600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the Detroit People Mover.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Originally standing 346\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) tall, the structure grew to 416\u00a0feet (127\u00a0m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \"crown\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972. It was the second-tallest building in the city after the slightly older Foshay Tower for many years, and stands slightly taller than the tower of its neighbor, Minneapolis City Hall.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Originally standing 346\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) tall, the structure grew to 416\u00a0feet (127\u00a0m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \"crown\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972.

Indie/folk acts Cat Power and Iron & Wine are based in the city, while alternative hip hop artist Sage Francis, electro artist Uffie, and the electroclash duo Avenue D were born in Miami, but musically based elsewhere. Also, ska punk band Against All Authority is from Miami, and rock/metal bands Nonpoint and Marilyn Manson each formed in neighboring Fort Lauderdale. Cuban American female recording artist, Ana Cristina, was born in Miami in 1985.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Originally standing 346\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) tall, the structure grew to 416\u00a0feet (127\u00a0m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \"crown\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972. It was the second-tallest building in the city after the slightly older Foshay Tower for many years, and stands slightly taller than the tower of its neighbor, Minneapolis City Hall.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Named for its current owner, it was previously known as the Qwest Building and the Northwestern Bell Telephone Building. Originally standing 346\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) tall, the structure grew to 416\u00a0feet (127\u00a0m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \"crown\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972. It was the second-tallest building in the city after the slightly older Foshay Tower for many years, and stands slightly taller than the tower of its neighbor, Minneapolis City Hall.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The bikeshare program called Hubway launched in late July 2011, logging more than 140,000 rides before the close of its first season.

Originally standing 346\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) tall, the structure grew to 416\u00a0feet (127\u00a0m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \"crown\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972. It was the second-tallest building in the city after the slightly older Foshay Tower for many years, and stands slightly taller than the tower of its neighbor, Minneapolis City Hall.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
