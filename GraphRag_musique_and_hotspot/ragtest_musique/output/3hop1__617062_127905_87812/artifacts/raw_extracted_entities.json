{"id":"c74693683650d4dc1f3e497c670baba6","chunk":"Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).","chunk_id":"c74693683650d4dc1f3e497c670baba6","document_ids":["025c6d3a1aef7ed202cd368132090e59"],"n_tokens":165,"entities":[{"name":"\"WORLD SERIES\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The

(Okkonen, p. 36, p. 120) In 1929, numbers were first added on the backs of uniforms by the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. By 1932, all major league baseball teams had numbers on their players' uniforms. The Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1952, became the first baseball team to add numbers to the fronts of their uniforms. In 1960, the Chicago White Sox were the first team to place players' names on the back of their jerseys, doing so on their road jerseys; within a few years, this practice became almost universal in MLB, though to this day the Yankees only wear names on their uniforms for Players Weekend, a yearly event where alternate uniforms with nicknames are used.","chunk_id":"9c636c6dbba1afb887d77d11a68f7f88","document_ids":["38c4462605847a638d189439e0f075ee"],"n_tokens":184,"entities":[{"name":"\"NEW YORK
