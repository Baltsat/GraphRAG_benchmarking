The vessel was renamed SS \"Doomba\", converted into a passenger ship, and operated in the waters around Brisbane until 1939, when she was requisitioned by the RAN for wartime service. Serving first as an auxiliary minehunter, then an auxiliary anti-submarine vessel, HMAS \"Doomba\" was purchased outright by the RAN in 1940, and served until early 1946, when she was sold and converted into a linseed oil lighter. \"Doomba\" was scuttled off Dee Why, New South Wales in 1976.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city.

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Ut\u00f6 and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines (\"Vesikko\" and \"Saukko\") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The Royal Australian Navy operated HMAS Samuel Benbow, while the United States Navy commissioned several ships, including the USS Admirable (AM-136), USS Brooklyn (CL-40), USS Catbird, USS Chanticleer, and USS Rhodes (DE-384). These ships played a significant role in military operations, serving as convoy escorts, providing fire support for amphibious landings, and participating in other naval activities. Additionally, the Crosley-class high speed transport ships and the 'Elizabeth C. Stanton' class transport ship were also involved during this period.

The Royal Australian Navy operated HMAS Samuel Benbow, while the United States Navy commissioned several ships, including the USS Admirable (AM-136), USS Brooklyn (CL-40), USS Catbird, USS Chanticleer, and USS Rhodes (DE-384). These ships played a significant role in military operations, serving as convoy escorts, providing fire support for amphibious landings, and participating in other naval activities. Additionally, the Crosley-class high speed transport ships and the 'Elizabeth C. Stanton' class transport ship were also involved during this period.

The Royal Australian Navy operated HMAS Samuel Benbow, while the United States Navy commissioned several ships, including the USS Admirable (AM-136), USS Brooklyn (CL-40), USS Catbird, USS Chanticleer, and USS Rhodes (DE-384). These ships played a significant role in military operations, serving as convoy escorts, providing fire support for amphibious landings, and participating in other naval activities. Additionally, the Crosley-class high speed transport ships and the 'Elizabeth C. Stanton' class transport ship were also involved during this period.
