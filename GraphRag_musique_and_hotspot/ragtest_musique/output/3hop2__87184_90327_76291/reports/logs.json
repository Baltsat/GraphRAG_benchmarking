Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.

Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was ``a states' - rights rebuff to desegregation.
