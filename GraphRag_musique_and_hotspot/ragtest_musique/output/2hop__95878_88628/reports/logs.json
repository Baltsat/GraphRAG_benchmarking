Written by Martha Hyer, based on the character Rooster Cogburn created by Charles McColl Portis in his 1968 western novel \"True Grit\", the film is about an aging one-eyed lawman whose badge was recently suspended for a string of routine arrests that ended in bloodshed. To earn back his badge, he is tasked with bringing down a ring of bank robbers that has hijacked a wagon shipment of nitroglycerin. He is helped by a spinster searching for her father's killer. \"Rooster Cogburn\" is a sequel to the 1969 film \"True Grit\".\n######################\nOutput:"}}
