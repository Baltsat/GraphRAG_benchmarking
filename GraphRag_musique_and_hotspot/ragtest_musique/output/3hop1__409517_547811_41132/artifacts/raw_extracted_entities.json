Secondly, the Festal Epistles state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328.

{"id":"37cd0027eafcdee1adc7cf101c5bf0ae","chunk":"Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30\u201375% and symptoms including fever of 38\u201341 \u00b0C (100\u2013106 \u00b0F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.","chunk_id":"37cd0027eafcdee1adc7cf101c5bf0ae","document_ids":["426361ab9b96073f82c7922a9032a267"],"n_tokens":217,"entities":[{"name":"\"PNEUMONIC

Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.

It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli.","chunk_id":"3ff65807e582a43140266b502ed00a18","document_ids":["c7616493a615ce818b0b11d8a8d7c3ca"],"n_tokens":162,"entities":[{"name":"\"ANTONIO

That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the Miasma theory.
