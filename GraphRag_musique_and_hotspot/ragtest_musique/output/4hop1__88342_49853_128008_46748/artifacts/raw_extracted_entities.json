{"id":"6cd92408ff4a79880d27152e5ce77641","chunk":"In Major League Baseball (MLB), the wild - card teams are the two teams in each of the two leagues (American and National) that have qualified for the postseason despite failing to win their division. Both teams in each league possess the two best winning percentages in their respective league after the three division winners. The wild card was first instituted in MLB in 1994, with one wild - card team per league advancing to the Division Series in the postseason to face a division winner. In 2012, the system was modified to add a second wild - card team per league and pit each league's wild - card teams against each other in a play - in game -- the MLB wild - card game -- the winner of which would then advance to the Division Series and play the team with the best record. This system ensures that the team with the second - best record in each league, after the three division winners and the team with the first - best record in the league that is a non-division winner, will also get a postseason berth, even if it is n't a division champion.","chunk_id":"6cd92408ff4a79880d27152e5ce77641","document_ids":["00278f4b01d3ec8949422c73550d9ccc"],"n_tokens":220,"entities":[{"name":"\"AMERICAN

The Patriots have since become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, winning 14 AFC East titles in 16 seasons since 2001, without a losing season in that period. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten - year period (126, in 2003 -- 2012), an undefeated 16 - game regular season in 2007, the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21 - game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (won eight straight division titles from 2009 to 2016). The team owns the record for most Super Bowls reached (seven) and won (five) by a head coach -- quarterback tandem. The Patriots are tied with the 49ers and Cowboys for the second most Super Bowl wins with five. The Steelers are in front with six.","chunk_id":"b4532eb99fa4cc35ce40a97f70ca43b8","document_ids":["575ebe2f1950090f7432842fa1c52207"],"n_tokens":238,"entities":[{"name":"\"BILL

{"id":"514a21d9ca254e6c937368a9d642c2e9","chunk":"Brady has been honored with four Super Bowl MVP awards (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI), the most ever by a single player, has won two league MVP awards (2007 and 2010), has been selected to 12 Pro Bowls, and has led his team to more division titles (14) than any other quarterback in NFL history. As of the end of the 2016 season, Brady is fourth all - time in career passing yards, fourth in career touchdown passes, and third in career passer rating. His career postseason record is 25 -- 9, winning more playoff games than any other quarterback, and he has appeared in more playoff games than any player at any position. Brady has never had a losing season as a starting quarterback in the NFL. His combined regular - season and postseason wins are also the most of any quarterback in NFL history. Because of his accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest ``steal ''in the history of the NFL Draft.","chunk_id":"514a21d9ca254e6c937368a9d642c2e9","document_ids":["e23dc576e3bd8eb82ace694ee5d97ca7"],"n_tokens":235,"entities":[{"name":"\"NFL\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The

Baltimore Orioles players have won the most awards for a single franchise (with six); players from the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants are tied for the most in the NL with five each. Five players have won the award twice: Willie Mays (1963, 1968), Steve Garvey (1974, 1978), Gary Carter (1981, 1984), Cal Ripken, Jr. (1991, 2001), and Mike Trout (2014, 2015). The award has been shared by multiple players once; Bill Madlock and Jon Matlack shared the award in 1975. Two players have won the award for a game in which their league lost: Brooks Robinson in 1966 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. One pair of awardees were father and son (Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr.), and another were brothers (Roberto Alomar and Sandy Alomar, Jr.). Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim became the first player ever to win the MVP award in back - to - back years in the 86 - year history of the MLB All - Star Game when he accomplished the feat in both 2014 and 2015. Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros is the most recent MLB All - Star Game MVP, winning the award in 2018. Only six players have won the MVP award in the only All - Star Game in which they appeared; LaMarr Hoyt, Bo Jackson, J.D.
