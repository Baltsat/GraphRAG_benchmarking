Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954 -- 55). It is described in an earlier story, The Hobbit (1937), as a magic ring of invisibility. In the sequel, The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien ascribes to the Ring a darker character, with malevolent power going far beyond conferring invisibility: it was created by Sauron the Dark Lord as part of his design to win domination over Middle - earth. The Lord of the Rings concerns the quest to destroy the Ring to keep Sauron from fulfilling his design.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He appears sitting next to Aragorn during the council in Rivendell scene. When it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed, Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor, and Elrond proclaims the formation of the Fellowship of the Ring. The elf was dubbed ``Figwit ''by Tolkien fan Iris Hadad; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring, saying`` I will take it'', the film switches to a shot where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right, and Hadad's initial reaction was ``Frodo is grea... who is THAT?!? ''Later, Hadad corresponded with her university friend Sherry de Andres, and the two created the first Figwit fan website, www.figwitlives.net, calling him`` Legolas for the thinking woman''.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

After European settlement increased, traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes. In the 17th century, faced with a continuing, critical labor shortage, colonists primarily in the Chesapeake Bay Colony, imported Africans as laborers, sometimes as indentured servants and, increasingly, as slaves. African slaves were also imported into New York and other northern ports by the Dutch and later English. Some African slaves were freed by their masters during these early years.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

When it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed, Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor, and Elrond proclaims the formation of the Fellowship of the Ring. The elf was dubbed ``Figwit ''by Tolkien fan Iris Hadad; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring, saying`` I will take it'', the film switches to a shot where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right, and Hadad's initial reaction was ``Frodo is grea... who is THAT?!?

Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 ``Big Read ''survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the`` Nation's best - loved book''. In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia also found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite ``book of the millennium ''. The Lord of the Rings was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In the sequel, The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien ascribes to the Ring a darker character, with malevolent power going far beyond conferring invisibility: it was created by Sauron the Dark Lord as part of his design to win domination over Middle - earth. The Lord of the Rings concerns the quest to destroy the Ring to keep Sauron from fulfilling his design.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 ``Big Read ''survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the`` Nation's best - loved book''. In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia also found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite ``book of the millennium ''. The Lord of the Rings was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954 -- 55). It is described in an earlier story, The Hobbit (1937), as a magic ring of invisibility. In the sequel, The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien ascribes to the Ring a darker character, with malevolent power going far beyond conferring invisibility: it was created by Sauron the Dark Lord as part of his design to win domination over Middle - earth. The Lord of the Rings concerns the quest to destroy the Ring to keep Sauron from fulfilling his design.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
