Since then Everton have had a successful history winning the Cup Winners' Cup, the league title nine times and the FA Cup five times. They are the only club to have played over 100 seasons in the top flight of English football, the 2014 -- 15 season being their 112th.","chunk_id":"5e892be64bf5e97242183fa5f904c11c","document_ids":["03b6aaba171c2969bdf81c519ac390b4"],"n_tokens":142,"entities":[{"name":"\"ST.

MWR was also the last original Toyota team in the Sprint Cup Series to still be in operation, as Bill Davis Racing and Red Bull Racing Team have both ceased

Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their \"lucky\" yellow and blue strip, which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982\u201383.

After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998.

With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) - Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-league winners of the FA Cup. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902) being the last finalist from outside the top two
