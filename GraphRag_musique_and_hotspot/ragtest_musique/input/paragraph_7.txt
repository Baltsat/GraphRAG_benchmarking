Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing The Dark Knight, downplayed claims that Heath Ledger's Joker was the highlight of the film, saying, ``the best performance in the film, by a mile, is Gary Oldman's... it would be lovely to see him get a (n Academy Award) nomination because actually, he's the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this. ''Oldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer's supernatural thriller The Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli.
