Friends of the People is an American sketch comedy television series.
 It was slated to premiere on TruTV in summer 2014, but was pushed to October 28, 2014, as part of the network's shift in their programming direction.
 Many of the cast members (Jennifer Bartels, Jermaine Fowler, and Lil Rel Howery) were originally reported to be cast members of a planned revival of In Living Color which never materialized.
 The show's first season consists of 10 episodes.
 This makes it the network's first sketch comedy show.
 The series holds a TV-14 rating, though select episodes are rated TV-MA--also a first for the truTV network.
