Hot Package is an Adult Swim entertainment variety show, created by Derrick Beckles.
 The show parodies network entertainment shows such as "Entertainment Tonight" and "Access Hollywood".
 Instead of sourcing its news from real celebrities, TV shows, and films, all of Hot Package's "entertainment" news comes from found footage, including clips from forgotten B Films and bizarre TV shows.
 The show is hosted by Derrick Beckles, Pat O'Brien, Anastasia Roark, and Mark McGrath, and features colorful guests, makeovers, and interview segments.
 "Hot Package", produced by Abso Lutely Productions, Abominable Pictures, TV Carnage, and Williams Street, premiered on October 4, 2013, and has currently aired eleven episodes.
 On May 9, 2014, Adult Swim confirmed that Hot Package would be returning for a second season.
