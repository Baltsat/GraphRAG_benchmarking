In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from April 15, 1990, to May 19, 1994.
 Brothers Keenen and Damon Wayans created, wrote and starred in the program.
 The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California.
 The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented "in living color" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream color television.
 It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast were black, unlike other sketch comedy shows such as "Saturday Night Live" whose casts are mostly white.
 It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray African-American humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as "The Cosby Show", causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.
