The Spyker F1 Team, known as the Etihad Aldar Spyker F1 Team for sponsorship reasons was a Formula One team that competed in the 2007 Formula One World Championship, and was created by Spyker Cars after their buyout of the short-lived Midland F1 (formerly Jordan Grand Prix) team.
 The change to the Spyker name was accompanied by a switch in racing livery from the red and white previously used by Midland, to an orange and silver scheme—already seen on the Spyker Spyder GT2-R—orange being the national colour and the auto racing colour of the Netherlands.
 At the end of the 2007 season the team was sold and renamed Force India.
