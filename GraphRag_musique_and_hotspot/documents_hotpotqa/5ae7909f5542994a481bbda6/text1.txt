ByKolles Racing, formally known as Kodewa GmbH & Co.
 KG, is an auto racing team based in Greding, Germany.
 Founded in 2000 by Romulus Kolles and his son Colin Kolles as Kolles Racing, the company initially participated in German Formula 3 before moving to the F3 Euro Series from 2003 to 2005.
 Colin left the team to become director of the Jordan Grand Prix Formula One team at the start of the 2005 season, a position he held until 2009.
 With Colin away, Romulus moved the team to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters series with Audi under the sponsorship title Futurecom TME.
 The Kolles team shifted their interest to sports car racing by participating in the Le Mans Series and later the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, again with customer Audi prototypes.
 Colin returned to Formula One to helm the HRT F1 team in 2010, with Kodewa's workshop in Greding serving as a base of operations for the new team before HRT's new owners chose to release Kolles from the team and move their operations to Spain in 2012.
 Kodewa participated in the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship with the backing of Lotus Cars under the title Lotus LMP2.
 In 2014 they lost their Lotus backing and rebranded as ByKolles Racing with a new LMP1 prototype, the CLM P1/01.
