 Most of the poetry sung in this genre pertain to subjects like love, nature, philosophy etc., and the genre itself is not much different from Ghazals, though ghazals are bound to a peculiar metre.
 This genre is quite popular in many parts of India, notably in Karnataka and Maharashtra.
 This genre may be called by different names in other languages.
