Pacific Myth is a subscription-based serial album and the fifth major release by the Canadian progressive metal band Protest the Hero, distributed through the online music subscription service Bandcamp.
 Following the independent release of their crowdfunded 2013 album "Volition", the band sought to explore alternative release methods and decided upon a subscription-like platform wherein subscribers could get access to the scheduled arrival of a new song every month.
 Each of the songs, including artwork, lyrics, liner notes, instrumental versions, and high-quality downloads, were released through Bandcamp each month starting on October 15, 2015 with the first track, "Ragged Tooth," and ending on March 15, 2016 with the final track, "Caravan."
 The six songs effectively make up the band's fifth EP, and 11th overall release.
 It is the band's only release with Cam McLellan on bass and the first with Mike Ieradi on drums.
