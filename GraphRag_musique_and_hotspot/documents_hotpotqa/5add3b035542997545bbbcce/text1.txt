Killer BiSH is the third album by Japanese idol group BiSH released through Avex Trax on October 5, 2016.
 The album is the first full album by the group to be released from a major label.
 The album is the first release to feature new member Ayuni D, who joined the group in August 2016 following the departure of Hug Mii.
 Unlike their independent label albums, songs from the album were not released as free downloads prior to release.
 However, the album was released in its entirety in digital format a month prior to the physical release.
 The first 24 hours of the digital release had all of the group's releases including KiLLER BiSH priced at 300 yen.
 The album was preceded by the single "DEADMAN", released on May 4, 2016.
 The music video for the track "Orchestra" was posted on Youtube on September 9.
 RUKA from Visual-kei band Nightmare, a well known fan of BiSH and BiS, provided the music for the track "IDOL is SHiT".
 The track title is an homage to BiS's album IDOL is DEAD while the track is an homage to the song "IDOL" from that album.
