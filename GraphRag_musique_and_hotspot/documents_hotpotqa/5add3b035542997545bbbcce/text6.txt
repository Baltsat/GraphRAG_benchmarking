Change is the ninth album by American jazz pianist Andrew Hill featuring performances recorded and scheduled for release in 1966 on the Blue Note label.
 The album was originally scheduled for issue in 1967 as BST 84233, but was held back from release until 1975, when the tracks appeared under Sam Rivers' name, as part of the double LP set "Involution", which combined them with tracks recorded under Rivers' leadership which would eventually see release as "Dimensions & Extensions".
 The first release under Hill's name occurred in 1995 as part of the Mosaic box set "The Complete Blue Note Andrew Hill Sessions (1963-66)".
 The album features Hill's quartet performing six original compositions.
 In 2007, two alternate takes, previously included in the Mosaic set, were added to the 2007 CD release.
 The first one, a shorter take of "Violence", was initially chosen as master track for the piece.
