Utopia is the upcoming ninth studio album by Icelandic musician Björk, scheduled for release in November 2017 through One Little Indian Records.
 During a Facebook Live event held on 15 September 2017, the release date of the album's first single, Björk gave insight into the album's theme of utopia in an uncertain political environment: "We have Trump, we have Brexit, we have our issues in Iceland, we have our environmental issues.
 I think if there ever was an urgency or necessity to come up with another Utopian model, how we're going to live our lives, I think it's now, and (these are) my proposals."
