"Green Island Serenade" (; also known as "Serenade of Green Island") is a Mandarin Chinese classic song composed in 1954 by Zhou Lanping (周藍萍), first performed by Zi Wei (紫薇).
 Although many people believed that Teresa Teng had made this song famous, there is no evidence that Teresa Teng had sung this song.
 The lyrics of this song were probably written by either Pan Yingjie (潘英傑) or Gao Yudang.
