A Tribute to Teresa Teng - A Rocking Farewell (告别的摇滚) is a May 1995 tribute album by many of the leading lights of Beijing's first generation rock bands.
 Although the take of hardcore rock acts like Zang Tianshuo and 1989 on the gentle songs of Teresa Teng is rough edged, like Faye Wong's tribute Decadent Sound of Faye (菲靡靡之音) which appeared two months later, the album was a genuine and sincere tribute to the childhood appreciation of Teng as one of the first pop singers to be heard in China.
