The Cane Belt Railroad was chartered in the U.S. state of Texas in 1898.
 Formed by a group of businessmen from Eagle Lake, the short-line railroad was intended to bring the area's sugarcane to market.
 In 1902 a disagreement between two of the railroad's chief promoters proved deadly.
 By 1904 the line was in operation from Sealy to Matagorda on the Gulf of Mexico.
 That year the company's stock was bought by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the line continued operations under lease to the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway starting in 1905.
 By the 1920s, the local sugarcane industry collapsed but the railroad was saved by the discovery of two nearby sulphur mines.
 In 1948, the Cane Belt was merged into the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway.
 In the 1990s most of the original line was abandoned after the last sulphur mine closed.
 By 2013, only a small portion of the line south of Bay City was operating as part of the BNSF Railway.
