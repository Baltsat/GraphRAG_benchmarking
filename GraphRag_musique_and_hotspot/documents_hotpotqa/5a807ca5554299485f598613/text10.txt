The Indiana and Ohio Railway (reporting mark IORY) is an American railroad that operates 570 mi of track in Ohio, southern Michigan, and parts of southeastern Indiana.
 It is owned and operated by Genesee & Wyoming, who acquired the railroad in the 2012 purchase of RailAmerica.
 The Indiana and Ohio Railroad (reporting mark INOH) (merged into the IORY in 1997) was formed in 1978 to operate a branch between Valley Junction, Ohio and Brookville, Indiana.
 The IORY's original line, acquired in 1985, connected Mason and Monroe, Ohio.
 The IORY set up a tourist operation known as the Indiana and Ohio Scenic Railway which operated over this line.
 The tourist train still operates out of Lebanon, Ohio under the ownership of the Cincinnati Railway Company (CRC) under the name Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad.
 Another line, acquired in 1986, runs from Norwood to Brecon, Ohio.
 In 1991, the former DT&I between Washington Court House, Ohio and Springfield, Ohio came into the system via a designated operator agreement with the West Central Ohio Port Authority.
 The system expanded north into Michigan in 1997 when it acquired the remainder of the former DT&I mainline between Diann, Michigan and Springfield, Ohio.
 In 1994, it acquired two lines from Conrail in Springfield, Ohio: one between Springfield and Bellefontaine; and one between Springfield and Mechanicsburg.
 The Indiana and Ohio Central Railroad (reporting mark IOCR) was the designated owner of these two lines until 2004.
 One of the I&O's major events took place in 1996 when it was acquired by RailTex.
 In 2000 RailTex was absorbed by RailAmerica and in 2004 the I&O absorbed the Indiana and Ohio Central Railroad.
 Genesee & Wyoming acquired RailAmerica in December 2012.
