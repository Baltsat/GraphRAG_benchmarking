My Inspiration is a full-length studio album, released in the Philippines only, by Filipino singer Jake Zyrus.
 It was released on May 1, 2009 and is credited under the name Charice, which Zyrus used prior to his gender transition.
 It is a concept cover album dedicated to his mother Racquel Pempengco.
 However, despite its ten cover versions (one of which is a remix), this second album by Zyrus features one original song (in both a single and extended version), called "Always You", written by the Metropop Song Festival and Awit Award-winning songwriter Jonathan Manalo.
 The album has been certified platinum.
 Like his previous release, the album was also made available for digital download through Amazon.com MP3 Download on June 23, 2009.
 Some package versions include a second CD, which features a karaoke version of every song, very popular in Asian countries.
