Suanfa tongzong (General Source of Computational Methods) is a mathematical text written by sixteenth century Chinese mathematician Cheng Dawei (1533–1606) and published in the year 1592.
 The book contains 595 problems divided into 17 chapters.
 The book is essentially general arithmetic for the abacus.
 The book was the main source available to scholars concerning mathematics as it developed in China’s tradition.
 Six years after the publication of Suanfa Tongzong, Cheng Dawei published another book titled "Suanfa Zuanyao" ("A Compendium of calculating Methods").
 About 90% of the content of the new book came from the contents of four chapters of the first book with some rearrangement.
 It is said that when Suanfa Tongzong was first published, it sold so many copies that the cost of paper went up and the lucrative sales resulted in unscrupulous people beginning to print pirated copies of the book with many errors.
 it was this that forced the author to print an abridged version.
