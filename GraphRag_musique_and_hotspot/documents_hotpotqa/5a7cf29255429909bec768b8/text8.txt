Gollum is a genus of ground sharks in the family Pseudotriakidae, native to the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
 The genus was described in 1973 by biologist Leonard Compagno, who named it named after the character Gollum from J. R. R. Tolkien's works, noting the species "Gollum attenuatus" (the slender smooth-hound) "bears some resemblance in form and habits".
