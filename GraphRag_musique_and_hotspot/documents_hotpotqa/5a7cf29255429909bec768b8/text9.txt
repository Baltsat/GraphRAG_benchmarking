Ingerophrynus is a genus of true toads with 12 species.
 These species distributed in southern Yunnan and Indochina; peninsular Thailand and Malaya to Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Nias Island, Sulawesi, and the Philippines.
 This genus was established after a major taxonomical revision of frogs.
 Ten of the species in this genus were formerly considered species of the genus "Bufo".
 In 2007 a new species, "Ingerophrynus gollum", was added to this genus.
 This species is named after the character Gollum created by J. R. R. Tolkien.
