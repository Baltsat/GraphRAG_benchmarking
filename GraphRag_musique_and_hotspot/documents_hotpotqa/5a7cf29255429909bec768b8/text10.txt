From Unknown Worlds is an anthology of fantasy fiction short stories edited by John W. Campbell, Jr. and illustrated by Edd Cartier, the first of a number of anthologies drawing their contents from the classic magazine "Unknown" of the 1930s-40s.
 It was first published in magazine format by American company Street & Smith in 1948; the publication was an attempt to determine if there was a market for a revived "Unknown".
 Street & Smith printed 300,000 copies, against the advice of John Campbell, but although it sold better than the original, too many copies were returned for the publisher to be willing to revive the magazine.
 The first British edition was issued by Atlas Publishing in 1952; part of the run was issued in a hardcover binding.
 This edition omitted the story "One Man's Harp."
