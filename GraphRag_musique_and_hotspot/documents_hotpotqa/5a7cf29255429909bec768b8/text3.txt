Ingerophrynus gollum (Gollum's toad) is a species of true toad.
 It has only been recorded from Endau-Rompin National Park, Johor, in closed-canopy lowland forests in the early evening following brief periods of afternoon precipitation.
 It is called "gollum" with reference of the eponymous character of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.
