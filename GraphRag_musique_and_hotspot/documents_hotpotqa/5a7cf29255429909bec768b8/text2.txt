Gollum is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.
 He was introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel "The Hobbit", and became an important supporting character in its sequel, "The Lord of the Rings".
 Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields.
 Originally known as Sm√©agol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and later named Gollum after his habit of making "a horrible swallowing noise in his throat".
