Aaron Dupree Tippin (born July 3, 1958) is an American country music artist and record producer.
 Initially a songwriter for Acuff-Rose Music, he gained a recording contract with RCA Nashville in 1990.
 His debut single, "You've Got to Stand for Something" became a popular anthem for American soldiers fighting in the Gulf War and helped to establish him as a neotraditionalist country act with songs that catered primarily to the American working class.
 Under RCA's tenure, he recorded five studio albums and a Greatest Hits package.
 Tippin switched to Lyric Street Records in 1998, where he recorded four more studio albums, counting a compilation of Christmas music.
 After leaving Lyric Street in 2006, he founded a personal label known as Nippit Records, on which he issued the compilation album "Now & Then".
 A concept album, "In Overdrive", was released in 2009.
