Lou Lombardo (February 15, 1932 â€“ May 8, 2002) was an American filmmaker whose editing of the 1969 film "The Wild Bunch" has been called "seminal".
 In all, Lombardo is credited on more than twenty-five feature films.
 Noted mainly for his work as a film and television editor, he also worked as a cameraman, director, and producer.
 In his obituary, Stephen Prince wrote, "Lou Lombardo's seminal contribution to the history of editing is his work on "The Wild Bunch" (1969), directed by Sam Peckinpah.
 The complex montages of violence that Lombardo created for that film influenced generations of filmmakers and established the modern cinematic textbook for editing violent gun battles."
 Several critics have remarked on the "strange, elastic quality" of time in the film, and have discerned the film's influence in the work of directors John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and the Wachowskis, among others.
 While Lombardo's collaboration with Peckinpah lasted just a few years, his career was intertwined with that of director Robert Altman for more than thirty years.
 Lombardo edited Altman's 1971 film "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" (1971), which had "a radical approach to the use of dialogue and indeed other sound, both in and beyond the frame."
 Towards the end of his career Lombardo edited "Moonstruck" (1987) and two other films directed by Norman Jewison.
 While his editing is now considered "revolutionary" and "brilliant", Lombardo was never nominated for editing awards during his career.
