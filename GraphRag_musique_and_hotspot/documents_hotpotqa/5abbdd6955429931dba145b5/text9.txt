"In the First Place" is a song by the English rock group the Remo Four.
 It was released as a single in January 1999 to accompany the re-release of the 1968 psychedelic film "Wonderwall", directed by Joe Massot.
 The song was written by Colin Manley and Tony Ashton of the Remo Four and recorded in London in January 1968 during the sessions for George Harrison's "Wonderwall Music" soundtrack album.
 Having produced the track for the band, Harrison unearthed the recording 30 years later when supplying Massot with the master tapes for the film's music.
 Ashton and the Remo Four's drummer, Roy Dyke, also recorded the song with their subsequent group, Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, in 1969.
