Rainbow Bridge is a 1971 film directed by Chuck Wein about different countercultural figures interacting on the Hawaiian island of Maui.
 He described it as "a kind of space-age "Candid Camera".
 We're going to place Pat [New York model Pat Hartley, the protagonist] in all kinds of real-life situtations, and film what happens.
 We're going to shoot a lot of film and just see what comes out of it."
 Harry Shapiro adds, "the idea was to shoot an antidote to "Easy Rider", showing the positive side of the youth movement."
