On the Buses is a 1971 British comedy film directed by Harry Booth and starring Reg Varney and Doris Hare.
 The film is the first spin-off film from the TV sitcom "On the Buses" and was followed by two further films "Mutiny on the Buses" (1972) and "Holiday on the Buses" (1973).
 The films are set within a slightly different canon from the TV series; Stan and Jack work for a different bus company (Town & District instead of Luxton & District), and the three films form a loose story arc where Arthur and Olive become parents (despite their apparently sexless marriage).
