"Mary Poppins" is a song from the 2015 stage musical "Love Birds" with music and lyrics by Robert J. Sherman.
 It is sung by "The Original Quack Pack", a penguin barbershop quartet who resemble the penguins from the 1964 Walt Disney motion picture, "Mary Poppins".
 In dialogue leading up to the song, the penguins explain that while they did know the same nanny, (Mary Poppins) they are not the same penguins as in the movie.
 The song expresses their longing for the magical nanny of literary fame.
