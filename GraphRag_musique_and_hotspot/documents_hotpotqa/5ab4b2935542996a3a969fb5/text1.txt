Lucia Brown Berlin (November 12, 1936 â€“ November 12, 2004) was an American short story writer.
 She had a small, devoted following, but did not reach a mass audience during her lifetime.
 She rose to sudden literary fame eleven years after her death, in August 2015, with Farrar, Straus and Giroux's publication of a volume of selected stories, "A Manual For Cleaning Women", edited by Stephen Emerson.
 It hit "The New York Times" bestseller list in its second week, and within a few weeks, had outsold all her previous books combined.
 The collection was ineligible for most of the year-end awards (either because she was deceased, or it was recollected material), but was named to a large number of year-end lists, including the New York Times Book Review's "10 Best Books of 2015."
 It was also a finalist for the Kirkus Prize.
