Robert Seymour Bridges, OM (23 October 1844 – 21 April 1930) was Britain's poet laureate from 1913 to 1930.
 A doctor by training, he achieved literary fame only late in life.
 His poems reflect a deep Christian faith, and he is the author of many well-known hymns.
 It was through Bridges’ efforts that Gerard Manley Hopkins achieved posthumous fame.
