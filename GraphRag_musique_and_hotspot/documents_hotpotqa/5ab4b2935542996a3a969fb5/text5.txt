The White Horse Tavern, located in New York City's borough of Manhattan at Hudson Street and 11th Street, is known for its 1950s and 1960s Bohemian culture.
 It is one of the few major gathering-places for writers and artists from this period in Greenwich Village (specifically the West Village) that remains open.
 The bar opened in 1880 but was known more as a longshoremen's bar than a literary center until Dylan Thomas and other writers began frequenting it in the early 1950s.
 Due to its literary fame, in the past few decades the White Horse has become a popular destination among tourists.
