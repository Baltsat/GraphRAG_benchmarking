Ion Agârbiceanu (September 12, 1882 – May 28, 1963) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian writer, journalist, politician, theologian and Greek-Catholic priest.
 A native of Transylvania, he graduated from Budapest University, after which he was ordained.
 He was initially assigned to a parish in the Apuseni Mountains, which form the backdrop to much of his fiction.
 Before 1910, Agârbiceanu had achieved literary fame in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Romania; his work was disputed between the rival schools of "Sămănătorul" and Poporanism.
