In addition to the show's regular cast of voice actors, guest stars have been featured on "SpongeBob SquarePants", an American animated television series created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon.
 "SpongeBob SquarePants" chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom.
 Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled "The Intertidal Zone", which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s.
 He began developing "SpongeBob SquarePants" into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of "Rocko's Modern Life", which Hillenburg directed.
 The pilot episode first aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 1, 1999.
 The show's ninth season premiered in 2012, and episodes of "SpongeBob SquarePants" have aired.
 A feature-length film adaptation of the show, "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie", was released in 2004; in 2015, a sequel, "", was released.
