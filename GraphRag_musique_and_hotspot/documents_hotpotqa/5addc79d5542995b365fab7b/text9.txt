SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D (also known as SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D Ride, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride or SpongeBob SquarePants 3-D) is a cel-shaded 4-D film based upon the popular television series "SpongeBob SquarePants".
 It can be found at many aquariums and theme parks across the world.
 The ride consists of a pre-show which then leads into a stadium seated auditorium.
 The ride is in 4-D, meaning it is a motion simulator with a 3D movie.
 The effects on the ride vary at different parks.
 Water spray, bubbles, wind, leg ticklers, smoke, and smells are usually found.
