The Thrilla in Manila was the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.
 It was contested in 1975 for the heavyweight championship of the world at the Philippine Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines, on Wednesday, October 1.
 The venue was renamed from Araneta Coliseum, specifically for the match.
 Ali won by technical knockout (TKO) after Frazier's chief second, Eddie Futch, conceded the fight prior to the 15th round.
 The contest's name is derived from the frequent rhyming boast made by Ali that the fight would be a "killa and a thrilla and a chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila."
