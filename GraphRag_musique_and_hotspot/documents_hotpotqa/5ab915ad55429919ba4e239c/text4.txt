George Louis Chuvalo, CM (born September 12, 1937) is a retired Canadian professional boxer who was a five-time Canadian heavyweight champion, and two-time world heavyweight title challenger.
 Chuvalo, who is considered by many to have one of the best chins in boxing history, was never knocked down in his amateur career or his 93-fight professional career and was ranked #4 on ESPN's greatest chin in boxing history list.
 Chuvalo lost to Hall of Fame heavyweights such as Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman, but was credited for his spirited performances.
 He did defeat top contenders such as Yvon Durelle, Doug Jones, Jerry Quarry and Cleveland Williams.
 He fought for the world title twice, losing a controversial decision to Ernie Terrell and another decision in his first fight with Ali.
