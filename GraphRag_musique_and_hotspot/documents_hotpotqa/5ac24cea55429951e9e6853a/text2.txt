Oxford University Liberal Democrats (previously Oxford University Liberal Club and Oxford University Social Democrats) is the student branch of the Liberal Democrats for students at the University of Oxford.
 It is the official successor to both the Oxford University Liberal Club and the Oxford University Social Democrats, which voted to merge early in 1987, about a year in advance of the national parties.
