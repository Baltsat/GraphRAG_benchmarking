Katherine Murray Millett (September 14, 1934 â€“ September 6, 2017) was an American feminist writer, educator, artist, and activist.
 She attended Oxford University and was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors after studying at St Hilda's College, Oxford.
 She has been described as "a seminal influence on second-wave feminism", and is best known for her book "Sexual Politics" (1970), which was based on her doctoral dissertation at Columbia University.
 Journalist Liza Featherstone attributes previously unimaginable "legal abortion, greater professional equality between the sexes, and a sexual freedom" being made possible partially due to Millett's efforts.
