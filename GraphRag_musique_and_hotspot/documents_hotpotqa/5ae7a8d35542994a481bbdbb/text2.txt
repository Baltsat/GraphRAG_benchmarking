Also known as "The Bad Hemingway Contest," The International Imitation Hemingway Competition is an annual writing competition begun in Century City, California.
 Started in 1977 as a "promotional gag", and held for nearly thirty years, the contest pays mock homage to Ernest Hemingway by encouraging authors to submit a 'really good page of really bad Hemingway' in a Hemingway-esque style.
