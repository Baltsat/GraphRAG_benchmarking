Compulsory dances, now called pattern dance in ice dancing, are a part of ice dancing and artistic roller skating in which all the couples or solo dancers perform the same standardized steps and holds to music of a specified tempo and genre.
 One or more compulsory dances were usually skated as the first phase of ice dancing competitions.
 The 2009-10 season was the final season in which the segment was competed in ISU junior and senior level competition.
 In June 2010, the International Skating Union replaced the name "compulsory dance" with "pattern dance" for ice dancing, and merged it into the short dance beginning in the 2010â€“2011 figure skating season.
 Compulsory dances are still skated in international roller skating competitions, however as in ice skating, a new section called the Style Dance was introduced from the 2015/16 season alongside the standard compulsory dances and freedance categories.
 The style dance is very similar in structure to the short dance on ice.
