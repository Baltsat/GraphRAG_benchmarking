Bugaku (舞楽 , court dance and music) is the Japanese traditional dance that has been performed to select elites mostly in the Japanese imperial court, for over twelve hundred years.
 In this way, it has been known only to the nobility, although after World War II, the dance was opened to the public and has even toured around the world in 1959.
 The dance is marked by its slow, precise and regal movements.
 The dancers wear intricate traditional Buddhist costumes, which usually include equally beautiful masks.
 The music and dance pattern is often repeated several times.
 It is performed on a square platform, usually 6 yards by 6 yards.
