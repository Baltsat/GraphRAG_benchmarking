The Frug ( or "froog") was a dance craze from the mid-1960s, which included vigorous dance to pop music.
 It evolved from another dance of the era, the Chicken.
 The Chicken, which featured lateral body movements, was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the Twist.
 As young dancers grew more tired they would do less work, moving only their hips while standing in place.
 They then started making up arm movements for the dance, which prompted the birth of the Swim, the Monkey, the Dog, the Watusi, the Mashed Potato, and the Jerk.
 The Frug is sometimes referred to as the Surf, Big Bea, and the Thunderbird.
