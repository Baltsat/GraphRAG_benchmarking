The Chicken is a popular rhythm and blues dance started in America in the 1950s, in which the dancers flapped their arms and kicked back their feet in an imitation of a chicken.
 The dance featured lateral body movements.
 It was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the Twist.
 The chicken dance gained even more popularity when Rufus Thomas wrote "Do the Funky Chicken", a hit record in 1970.
