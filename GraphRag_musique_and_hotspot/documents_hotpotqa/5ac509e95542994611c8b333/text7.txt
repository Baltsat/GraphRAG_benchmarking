In physics, dynamic speckle is a result of the temporal evolution of a speckle pattern where variations in the scattering elements responsible for the formation of the interference pattern in the static situation produce the changes that are seen in the speckle pattern, where its grains change their intensity (grey level) as well as their shape along time.
 One easy to observe example is milk: place some milk in a teaspoon and observe the surface in direct sunlight.
 You will see a "dancing" pattern of coloured points.
 Where the milk dries on the spoon at the edge, the speckle is seen to be static.
 This is direct evidence of the thermal motion of atoms, which cause the Brownian motion of the colloidal particles in the milk, which in turn results in the dynamic speckle visible to the naked eye.
