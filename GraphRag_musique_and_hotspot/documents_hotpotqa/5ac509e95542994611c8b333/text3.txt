Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing.
 There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A).
 A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)).
 The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B).
 There are another 8 alleles reported in BGMUT, the most discovered reciently in China and Taiwan.
 In the cis-AB genotype, both antigens are expressed, like in a standard (trans) AB genotype.
 In a traditional AB phenotype, A and B antigenes are inherited separately from the father and mother while a cis-AB allele comes from one parent only.
 In a serum test, cis-AB tests almost the same as a traditional AB, but people with this rare type have problems with blood transfusions.
 Some of them need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood.
