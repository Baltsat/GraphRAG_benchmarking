Dance moves or dance steps (more complex dance moves are called dance patterns, dance figures, dance movements, or dance variations) are usually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and use them independently of each other.
 However, more complex movements are influenced by musicality and lyrical relevance to express emotions or refer to a message.
