The Siloam Tunnel (Hebrew: נקבת השילוח‎ ‎ , "Nikbat HaShiloah"), also known as Hezekiah's Tunnel, is a water tunnel that was carved underneath the City of David in Jerusalem in ancient times.
 Its popular name is due to the most common hypothesis of its origin, namely that it dates from the reign of Hezekiah of Judah (late 8th and early 7th century BCE) and corresponds to the Water Works mentioned in in the Bible.
 According to the Bible, King Hezekiah prepared Jerusalem for an impending siege by the Assyrians, by "blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David" ( ).
