The City of David (Hebrew: (Hebrew: עיר דוד‎ , "Ir David"; literal translation to Arabic: مدينة داوود‎ ‎ , "Madina Dawud", common Arabic name: وادي حلوه , "Wadi Hilweh") is an Israeli settlement and the archaeological site which is speculated to compose the original urban core of ancient Jerusalem.
 First suggested in 1920, the name was used officially from the 1970s, following the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel, but today the name is questioned in the archaeological academic community.
 In 1997 management of the park was taken over by Ir David Foundation.
 Although it is located within the Jerusalem Municipality, it is considered a settlement, having been built on land in the West Bank that was occupied by and annexed to Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War and 1980 Jerusalem Law.
 The international community regards Israeli settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
 It is best known for its Iron Age structures attributed to Judean kings, and it also contains older Canaanite infrastructure dated to the Middle Bronze Age.
