Black Bastards (or Bl_ck B_st_rds) is the second and final studio album by KMD (a rap trio featuring an early alias of MF DOOM), completed in 1993 and eventually released in 2001 through ReadyRock.
 Initially, the album was scheduled for release in 1993, but Elektra Records canceled the album, reportedly due to the controversial cover art, which shows a Sambo figure being lynched, and its black nationalist, Five-Percenter lyrics.
 However, the album displayed no obvious Five-Percenter rhetoric, yet the project was racially candid, as demonstrated by the album title, its cover art, and the sample collage intro.
 Zev Love X's brother DJ Subroc was killed when he was struck by a car shortly before the album was completed.
