Powertrippin' is the third studio album released by Scottish heavy metal band The Almighty.
 It was released in the United Kingdom in 1993 by Polydor Records and was the band's last studio album for that label.
 It was The Almighty's first album with new guitarist Pete Friesen who replaced founding guitarist Tantrum who had left the band in 1992.
 Friesen contributed to the songwriting and was a major part of the new sound presented on this album, introducing a heavier, riff based grunge sound compared to the punk leanings of earlier efforts.
 The subject of the cover art is taken directly from a psychedelic concert poster for MC5 designed by the legendary poster artist Gary Grimshaw in 1966, which is tracing of Life magazine cover from December 6, 1954, Jet Age Man by Ralph Morse.
