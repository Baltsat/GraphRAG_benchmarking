X&Y (stylized as X & Y) is the third studio album by the British rock band Coldplay.
 It was released on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States.
 The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple.
 It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them.
 The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code.
