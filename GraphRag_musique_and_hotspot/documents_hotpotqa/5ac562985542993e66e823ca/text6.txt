The Shapingba Railway Station is a railway station of Chengyu Passenger Railway that is located in Shapingba District of Chongqing, People's Republic of China.
 Currently it is closed.
 After having been demolished, construction started in 2013 to rebuild it as an underground train station.
 According to current plans the underground complex will be opened in 2015 and also include stations for two subway lines.
 It will be part of the Chengdu-Chongqing Intercity Railway due to open in 2015, allowing for journeys to Chengdu in around an hours travel time.
 Once completed it was anticipated that the name would change to Chongqing West Railway Station but this has now been given to a new fourth major railway station for Chongqing in nearby Shangqiao area of Shapingba District.
