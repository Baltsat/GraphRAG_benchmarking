How I Met Your Music is the name of two albums (the first being followed by the subtitle (Original Songs from the Hit Series "How I Met Your Mother"), the second being followed by Deluxe) composed of songs from the CBS television series "How I Met Your Mother", the first of which was released hours before the Season 8 premiere.
 It features 20 songs that had appeared in the first seven series on the show and was released only digitally, originally through iTunes.
 A second iteration, titled "How I Met Your Music: Deluxe" album, was released a year later.
 It contains an entirely different play list.
 Many critics have said that the albums reflect the series' consistently effective use of music.
