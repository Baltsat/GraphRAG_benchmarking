Rock Nominees Ltd was part of the business empire of Lord Ashcroft, a Tory peer who has been criticised for offshore tax avoidance.
 It is a company which holds shares on behalf of other companies.
 It had 201,300 shares for Gambier Holdings Inc. (a British Virgin Islands company) and 65,000 shares for Kiwi Ltd. (a Belize company) invested in RCO (Holdings) plc.
 Its stake made up 2.48%.
 RCO itself was in the cleaning, catering and security porterage business.
 In 2000 a company called ISS (UK) Ltd took over RCO, acquiring 96.4% of the shares.
 It made one of RCO's subsidiaries transfer its shares to one of ISS's subsidiaries for Â£30,117,784.
 Rock Nominee's filed for a petition of unfair prejudice on the grounds that this was a transaction at an undervalue.
 It did not reflect the value to the purchaser of the synergies arising from the sale or the value of avoiding risk from a sale on the open market.
