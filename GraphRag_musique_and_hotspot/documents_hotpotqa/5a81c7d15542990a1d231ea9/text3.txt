An Integrated Service Provider (ISP) is a for-hire firm that performs a variety of logistics service activities such as warehousing, transportation, and other functional activities that constitute a total service package.
 In addition, other categories of spend may fall under the ISP's scope such as maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) services.
 Firms that provide such services typically have a good understanding of their customers needs and are responsible for executing services in accordance with contract documents.
 Normally the scope of work (SOW) and the ISP contract are finalized only after an extensive due diligence period.
