Scattergories is a creative-thinking category-based party game originally published by Parker Brothers in 1988.
 Parker Brothers was purchased by Hasbro a few years later, and they published the game internationally under their Milton Bradley brand.
 The objective of the 2-to-6-player game is to score points by uniquely naming objects within a set of categories, given an initial letter, within a time limit.
 The game is based on a traditional game known as Tutti Frutti, Jeu du Baccalaur√©at, Stadt Land Fluss, and many other names.
