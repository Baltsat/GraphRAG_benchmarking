Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Ewok Adventure, also known as Revenge of the Jedi: Game I, is a cancelled 1983 shoot 'em up video game based on the 1983 "Star Wars" film "Return of the Jedi".
 The game was developed by Atari Games and was to be published by Parker Brothers on the Atari 2600.
 Although it was completed, the game was never released for sale, as the marketing department of Parker Brothers considered the controls too difficult to master.
 A prototype cartridge surfaced in 1997.
