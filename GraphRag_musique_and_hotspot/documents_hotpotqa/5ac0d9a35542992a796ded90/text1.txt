Hungry Shark is a series of mobile games developed/published by Future Games of London (prior to Hungry Shark Evolution) and published by Ubisoft (since Hungry Shark Evolution).
 The games allow players to control several unique species of sharks, including mako sharks, great white sharks, hammerhead sharks, reef sharks, and megalodon; to progress, the player must consume other marine animals and grow in size until the next, more powerful shark is available for purchase.
 In May 2016, Hungry Shark World was downloaded 10 million times in six days, reaching the top 10 free iPhone and Android apps.
