Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell was a video game scheduled to be released for the Atari 2600 and published by Parker Brothers, having been announced in their 1983 catalog.
 However, it was never released, and it was believed little or no work done on the game's coding.
 Twenty years later, a former Parker Brothers employee gave a prototype of the game to the operator of the AtariAge website.
 Surprisingly, the game was quite complex and seemed to be complete.
 Several characters from the book make appearances in the game, including Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Aragorn, Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and Glorfindel.
