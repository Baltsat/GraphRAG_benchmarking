Mid-Hudson Civic Center is a venue located in Poughkeepsie, New York, consisting of Mair Hall (a concert and convention hall) and the McCann Ice Arena (an ice skating venue).
 It was built in the 1970s as part of the general attempt at rehabilitation of the central district of the City of Poughkeepsie.
 It is located at 14 Civic Center Plaza, on a segment of what was formerly known as Market Street near the former Main Mall.
 The Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel, at 40 Civic Center Plaza, is adjacent on the same block and was originally designed to be constructed concurrently with the civic center and financed by Hilton, but the hotel construction was abandoned after the foundation was laid.
 Four years after the completion of the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, Radisson Hotels bought the hotel property and after a re-design of the original hotel plans, construction of the hotel resumed.
