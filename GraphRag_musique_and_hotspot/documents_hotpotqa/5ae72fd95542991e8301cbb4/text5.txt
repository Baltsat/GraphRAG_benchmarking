The Colorado State Capitol Building, located at 200 East Colfax Avenue in Denver, Colorado, United States, is the home of the Colorado General Assembly and the offices of the Governor of Colorado and Lieutenant Governor of Colorado.
 The building is intentionally reminiscent of the United States Capitol.
 Designed by Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed in the 1890s from Colorado white granite, and opened for use in November 1894.
 The distinctive gold dome consists of real gold leaf, first added in 1908, commemorating the Colorado Gold Rush.
 The building is part of Denver's Civic Center area.
 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Civic Center Historic District in 1974, and became part of the Denver Civic Center National Historic Landmark District in 2012.
