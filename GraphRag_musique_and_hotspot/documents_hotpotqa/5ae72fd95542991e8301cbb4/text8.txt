A civic center or civic centre is a prominent land area within a community that is constructed to be its focal point or center.
 It usually contains one or more dominant public buildings, which may also include a government building.
 Recently, the term "civic center" has been used in reference to an entire central business district of a community or a major shopping center in the middle of a community.
 In this type of civic center, special attention is paid to the way public structures are grouped and landscaped.
