 He settled on the French Prairie in what is now the state of Oregon where in 1843 he participated in the Champoeg Meetings.
 Pierre was elected one of three Constables.
 He voted affirmative for the measure to form a provisional government at the May 2, 1843 meeting.
 That measure passed and led to the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon.
