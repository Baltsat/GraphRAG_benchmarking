Baron François-Xavier Donzelot (7 January 1764, Mamirolle – 11 June 1843) was a French general and a Governor of the Ionian Islands and Martinique.
 He was the son of François Donzelot and Jeanne–Baptiste Maire and had a brother named Joseph.
 He became a general of the French army in March 1801.
 Months later, he signed the surrender of Egypt to British forces.
 He then returned to France where he served in various high-echelon positions in Napoleon's army.
 Subsequently, he was appointed to serve as the head of the French garrison in Corfu and the Ionian Islands from 1807 to 1814.
 As governor, he resided in Corfu, where his gentle demeanour and mild manners made him popular with the Corfiotes.
 In 1808, he was named Baron of the Empire.
 In 1815, he was a divisional commander of Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Waterloo, during the 100-day return of Napoleon.
 After the defeat at Waterloo, he lost his position and did not work until 1817 when he was appointed governor of Martinique.
