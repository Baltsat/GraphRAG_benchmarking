Jean-Michel de Lepinay was the governor of the French colony of Louisiana (New France) from 1717 to 1718.
 Before serving as governor, Lepinay had been a naval officer and served over twenty years in Canada.
 He was appointed governor by Antoine Crozat, the royally appointed administrator of the colony.
 Lepinay came to the colony with a new Commissary-Commissioner, fifty new colonists, and three companies of infantry.
 However, Lepinay soon found himself at odds with Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, twice governor and an influential leader in the colony.
 Failing to show any improvement over the administration of the former governor, Sieur de Cadillac, Lepinay was replaced as governor by Bienville after Crozat successfully petitioned to be released from his agreement to develop the colony.
