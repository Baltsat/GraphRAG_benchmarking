"Cold Comfort" is the fourth episode of the second series of the British dark comedy anthology television programme "Inside No. 9".
 The episode, which was written and directed by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, was first broadcast on 16 April 2015 on BBC Two.
 Most of "Cold Comfort" is composed of a stream from a fixed camera on the desk of Andy, the protagonist, with smaller pictures on the side of the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed.
 "Cold Comfort" was filmed over two and a half days in Twickenham, and was, like "A Quiet Night In" from "Inside No. 9"'s first series, highly experimental.
 It was Pemberton and Shearsmith's directorial debut.
