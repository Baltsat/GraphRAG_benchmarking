The Special Operation Forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces serve as Jordan's premiere special forces unit.
 Founded on April 15, 1963 on the orders of the late King Hussein, its primary roles include reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, search and evacuation, intelligence gathering combat, and the protection of key sites.
 The Special Operation Forces are also charged with carrying out precision strikes against critical enemy targets.
 The 14,000-strong unit are equipped and trained to be able to operate behind enemy lines for long periods without any logistical support, and is considered one of the finest special forces units in the world.
