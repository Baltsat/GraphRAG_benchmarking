The Mexican Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales (Special Forces Corps) is a special forces unit of the Mexican Army.
 Formerly the "GAFE" (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales | Special-Forces Airmobile Group), the SF Corps has six battalions; one is the "Fuerza especial de reaccion", a quick-response unit, and one is assigned to the Paratroopers Rifle Brigade; the motto of the SF Corps is "Todo por México" (Everything for Mexico).
 Within the SF Corps, there are regular, intermediate, and veteran -service troops.
 The regular-service soldiers usually operate as light infantry.
 The intermediate-service soldiers (lieutenants and captains) usually are instructors.
 The veteran-service soldiers of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales del Alto Mando (GAFE High Command) handle Black-Ops missions.
 Also known as the COIFE, the Special Forces Corps of the Mexican Army is equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces.
