Caladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.
 Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.
 The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.
 The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.
 The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.
 Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state.
