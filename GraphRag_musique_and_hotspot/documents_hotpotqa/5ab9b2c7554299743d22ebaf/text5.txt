Microtis, commonly known as onion orchids or mignonette orchids is a genus of about 20 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.
 Onion orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant.
 They are similar to orchids in the genus "Prasophyllum" in that they have an onion-like leaf.
 The flowers are small but often scented and attractive to their insect pollinators.
 They are widespread in Asia, Australia and some Pacific islands.
