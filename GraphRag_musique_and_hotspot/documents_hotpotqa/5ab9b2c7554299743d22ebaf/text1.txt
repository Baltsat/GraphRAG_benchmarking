Paracaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.
 The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.
 Orchids in this genus are similar to "Caleana major", but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.
 "Paraceleana" orchids, as well as hammer orchids ("Drakaea") are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.
 Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers.
