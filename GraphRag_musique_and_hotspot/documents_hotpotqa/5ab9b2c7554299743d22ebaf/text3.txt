Ornithidium donaldeedodii is a species of orchids "discovered" in April 2010 when DNA analysis showed that a wrongly labeled orchid at the University of California Botanical Garden in Berkeley, California, was actually a distinct new species.
 The "new" orchid, which had been mislabeled as "Maxillaria croceorubens" since the 1990s, was named after orchidologist Donald D. Dod (1912â€“2008), who collected the specimen in the 1980s in Haiti.
 The new orchid was officially described in "Lankesteriana", an international journal on orchidology, by authors James Ackerman of the University of Puerto Rico and W. Mark Whitten of the Florida Museum of Natural History.
