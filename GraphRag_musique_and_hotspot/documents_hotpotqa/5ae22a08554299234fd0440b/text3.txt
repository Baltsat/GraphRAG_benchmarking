Canadian heavy metal music has a long history.
 Going back to the late 1960s, Canada has produced metal bands that have and continue to influence metal bands to this day.
 In 1964, Toronto-based band The Sparrows was formed.
 This band later changed their name to Steppenwolf and featured Canadians John Kay, Goldy McJohn and Jerry Edmonton.
 Steppenwolf's 1968 single "Born to be Wild" was the first use of the words 'heavy metal' in a song's lyric.
 In 1970, Woodstock, Ontario based Warpig released their metal music debut, which, although never reaching mainstream success like fellow heavy metal bands Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer, has become a cult favourite within the Doom metal scene.
