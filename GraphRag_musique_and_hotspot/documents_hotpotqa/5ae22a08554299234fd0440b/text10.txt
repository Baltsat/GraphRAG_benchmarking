Boize was a Canadian heavy metal and glam metal band based in Montreal, Quebec.
 The band was formed in the spring of 1989 in Laval, Quebec when vocalist Perry Blainey responded to an advertisement placed in the Montreal Gazette newspaper by bassist and keyboardist St√©phane Fania and guitarist Robert Kourie.
 Boize was associated with record label Aquarius Records and was managed by Canadian musician star and recording studio owner Bill Hill, under his music production company and management agency Bill Hill Productions.
 The band also had a brief association with South American heavy metal legend Alvacast, when singer Carlos "Charly" Lopez joined Boize as new vocalist in the fall of 1992.
