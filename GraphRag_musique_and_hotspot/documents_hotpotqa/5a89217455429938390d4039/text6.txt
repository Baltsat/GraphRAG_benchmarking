Suzuki F10D engine is an inline 4-cylinder 1061cc engine that was developed in India by Maruti Suzuki for the domestic market.
 It was debuted in the Maruti Wagon-R in India in 2001.
 It was briefly installed in Maruti Alto and it was the engine that the first Maruti Zen Estilo came with.
 This engine is very similar to the 3-cylinder F8D 12-valve engine that was optional on the Maruti 800 at the time.
 The bore and stroke of F10D is the same as that of the smaller sibling and shares quite a few parts like pistons, rings, conrods and valves.
 The cast-iron engine block is very similar to that of the older F10A 970cc engine that powered the earlier Maruti Gypsy and Maruti 1000.
 Both F10A and F10D shares the same stroke length; but interchangeability of parts between these two engines is not known.
