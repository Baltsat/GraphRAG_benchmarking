The Suzuki Cultus Crescent is a compact car that was produced by Suzuki in Japan between 1995 and 2002, with South Asian production continuing until 2007.
 The Cultus Crescent was sold as such in Japan until May 1998, when it was renamed Suzuki Cultus due to the sales discontinuation of the previous Cultus in the Japanese market.
 The Cultus Crescent was also marketed as the Suzuki Esteem in North America, and as the Suzuki Baleno (Japanese: スズキ・バレノ , Suzuki Bareno ) throughout Asia, Australasia, Europe and South America.
 In India where it was manufactured by Maruti Suzuki, the Cultus Crescent was sold as the Maruti Baleno.
 In the Philippines, it was marketed as the Chevrolet Cassia.
