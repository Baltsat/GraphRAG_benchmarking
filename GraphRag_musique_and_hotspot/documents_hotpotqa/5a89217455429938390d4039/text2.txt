The Maruti Eeco was introduced in India by Maruti Suzuki during early 2010.
 This car is essentially a stripped down version of defunct Versa.
 This is an urgent refresh in lines with Maruti Suzuki not being able to come up with a new minivan.
 EECO comes with 5-seater and 7-seater options.
 Eeco is equipped with advanced Engine Management System for optimizing fuel efficiency and performance.
 It is branded by the manufacturer as "a perfect car for every occasion"-a business trip or a picnic with the loved ones.
