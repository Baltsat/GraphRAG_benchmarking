The Somaliland Campaign, also called the Anglo-Somali War or the Dervish War, was a series of military expeditions that took place between 1900 and 1920 in the Horn of Africa, pitting the Dervishes led by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the "Mad Mullah", although he "was neither mad nor a mullah") against the British.
 The British were assisted in their offensives by the Ethiopians and Italians.
 During the First World War (1914â€“1918), Hassan also received aid from the Ottomans, Germans and, for a time, from the Emperor Iyasu V of Ethiopia.
 The conflict ended when the British aerially bombed the Dervish capital of Taleh in February 1920.
