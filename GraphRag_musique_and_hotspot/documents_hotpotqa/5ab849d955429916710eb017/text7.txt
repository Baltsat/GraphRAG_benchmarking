The Battle of El Herri (also known as Elhri) was fought between France and the Berber Zaian Confederation on 13 November 1914.
 It took place at the small settlement of El Herri, near Khénifra in the French protectorate in Morocco.
 The battle was part of the Zaian War, in which the confederation of tribes sought to oppose continued French expansion into the interior of Morocco.
 Having captured the strategic town of Khénifra earlier in the year, the French, under General Hubert Lyautey, entered negotiations with Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, who led the Zaian.
 Lyautey thought that peace could be achieved and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel René Laverdure, who commanded the garrison in Khénifra, not to launch any offensives.
