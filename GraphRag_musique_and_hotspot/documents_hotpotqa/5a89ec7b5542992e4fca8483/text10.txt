O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst is a poem written by Ferdinand Freiligrath, a 19th-century German writer.
 In 1847, Hungarian composer Franz Liszt set the poem to music (soprano voice and piano), and eventually adapted it into his famous Liebesträume No. 3.
 The work is one of Liszt's most famous and poignant.
 "Liebesträume" in German means "Dreams of Love".
