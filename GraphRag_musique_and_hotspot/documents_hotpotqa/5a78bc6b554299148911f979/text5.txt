Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: "Kathoei"  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand.
 A significant number of Thais perceive "kathoeys" as belonging to a third gender, including many "kathoeys" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman.
 However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as "phuying" (Thai: ผู้หญิง "women"), with a minority referring to themselves as "phuying praphet song" (a "second kind of woman") and only very few referring to themselves as "kathoey".
 Related phrases include "phet thi sam" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , "third gender"), and "sao praphet song" or "phu ying praphet song" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning "second-type female").
 The word "kathoey" is of Khmer origin.
 It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia.
