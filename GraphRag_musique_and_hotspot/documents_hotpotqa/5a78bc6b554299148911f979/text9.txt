The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage.
 This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s.
 The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings.
 These magazines are known for their belligerent assault on national leadership and use of secret offices, sometimes called bush offices to print their publications.
 Some critics have raised ethnic nationalism and cultural coloration as key factors which provided the impetus for most of the rhetoric.
