Last Call Cleveland is a sketch comedy troupe.
 The members originally met when they were students at Kent State University, where they produced a late-night cable show that aired on the student-run campus network TV2.
 The show moved to Cleveland in 2001 to local broadcast cable station THE CAT (WAX 35 Cleveland and WAOH 29 Akron).
 The group started doing live sketch comedy at the shortly lived Second City Cleveland, where they remain a sketch group today.
 Although most of their performances have been in northeastern Ohio (primarily at Cabaret Dada, the Second City Cleveland theater and the House of Blues) they have also performed in Chicago at the Chicago Sketchfest, Washington, D.C. and in Los Angeles at the ImprovOlympic theater.
