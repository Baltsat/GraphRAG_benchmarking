COUM Transmissions were a music and performance art collective who operated in the United Kingdom from 1969 through to 1976.
 Influenced by the Dada artistic movement, COUM were openly confrontational and subversive, challenging aspects of conventional British society.
 Founded in Hull, Yorkshire by Genesis P-Orridge, other prominent early members included Cosey Fanni Tutti and Spydeee Gasmantell (also at school with Genesis P-Orridge).
 Part-time member included Menzies, Haydn Robb, Les Maull (aka The Reverend Lelli), Ray Harvey and Fizzy Paet.
 Later members included Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson and Chris Carter, who together with P-Orridge and Fanni Tutti went on to found the pioneering industrial band Throbbing Gristle in 1976.
