Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 – 8 September 1949) was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras.
 He is known for his operas, which include "Der Rosenkavalier", "Elektra", "Die Frau ohne Schatten" and "Salome"; his Lieder, especially his "Four Last Songs"; his tone poems, including "Don Juan", "Death and Transfiguration", "Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks", "Also sprach Zarathustra", "Ein Heldenleben", "Symphonia Domestica", and "An Alpine Symphony"; and other instrumental works such as "Metamorphosen" and his Oboe Concerto.
 Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire.
