I Capuleti e i Montecchi ("The Capulets and the Montagues") is an Italian opera ("Tragedia lirica") in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini.
 The libretto by Felice Romani was a reworking of the story of "Romeo and Juliet" for an opera by Nicola Vaccai called "Giulietta e Romeo" and based on the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola written in 1818, thus an Italian source rather than taken directly from William Shakespeare.
