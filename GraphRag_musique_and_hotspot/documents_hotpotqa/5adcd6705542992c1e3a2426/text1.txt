Der Rosenkavalier (The Knight of the Rose or The Rose-Bearer), Op. 59, is a comic opera in three acts by Richard Strauss to an original German libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
 It is loosely adapted from the novel "Les amours du chevalier de Faublas" by Louvet de Couvrai and Molière’s comedy "Monsieur de Pourceaugnac".
 It was first performed at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 26 January 1911 under the direction of Max Reinhardt, Ernst von Schuch conducting.
 Until the premiere the working title was "Ochs von Lerchenau".
 (The choice of the name Ochs is not accidental, for in German Ochs means ox, which depicts the character of the Baron throughout the opera.)
