The Theotokos of Vladimir (Greek: Θεοτόκος του Βλαντίμιρ ), also known as Our Lady of Vladimir, Vladimir Mother of God, or Virgin of Vladimir (Russian: Владимирская Икона Божией Матери ) is a medieval Byzantine icon of the Virgin and Child.
 In 1169 Andrei Bogolyubsky sacked Kiev, and, after plundering the city, stole much religious artwork, including a Byzantine "Mother of God" icon which was transferred to Vladimir (for references see Yury Dolgorukiy and Andrey Bogolyubskiy).
 It is one of the most venerated Orthodox icons and a fine and early example of the iconography of the "Eleusa" (tenderness) type, with the Christ child snuggling up to his mother's cheek.
 The "Theotokos" (Greek for Virgin Mary, literally meaning "Birth-Giver of God") is regarded as the holy protectress of Russia.
 The icon is displayed in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow in a functioning church in the grounds of the museum.
 Her feast day is June 23rd o.s. / July 6th n.s. Even more than most famous icons, the original has been copied repeatedly for centuries, and many copies have considerable artistic and religious significance of their own.
