Eve's pudding, also known as Mother Eve's pudding, is a type of traditional British pudding now made from apples and Victoria sponge cake mixture.
 The apples are allowed to stew at the bottom of the baking dish while the cake mixture cooks on top.
 The name is a reference to the biblical Eve.
 It is a simplified version of Duke of Cumberland's pudding.
 The earliest known version dates from 1824, predating baking powder, and therefore uses grated bread and shredded suet.
