Yemoja (Yoruba: "Yem·ªçja" ) is a major water deity from the Yoruba religion.
 She is an orisha and the mother of all orishas, having given birth to the 14 Yoruba gods and goddesses.
 She is often syncretized with either Our Lady of Regla in the afrocuban diaspora or various other Virgin Mary figures of the Catholic Church, a practice that emerged during the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.
 Yemoja is motherly and strongly protective, and cares deeply for all her children, comforting them and cleansing them of sorrow.
 She is said to be able to cure infertility in women, and cowrie shells represent her wealth.
 She does not easily lose her temper, but when angered she can be quite destructive and violent, as the flood waters of turbulent rivers.
