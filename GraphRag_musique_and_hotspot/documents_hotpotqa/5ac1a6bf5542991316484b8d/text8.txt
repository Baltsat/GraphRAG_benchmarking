Sleepwalking is the debut full-length studio album by American metalcore band Memphis May Fire.
 The album was released through Trustkill Records on July 21, 2009.
 This album is the first album to feature lead vocalist Matty Mullins after former lead vocalist Chase Ryan left the band in 2008.
 Scheduled to be released summer 2008, the release got delayed because of the line-up change.
 Mullins has described the album as "a new breed of rock 'n' roll" and musically it has "more aggressive guitar work and noticeably more melodic, but still retains that southern swagger."
