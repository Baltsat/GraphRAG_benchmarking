Dead Throne is the fourth studio album by American metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada.
 It was released on September 13, 2011 through Ferret Music.
 Produced by Adam Dutkiewicz, the record was recorded in several studios across the United States from November 2010 â€“ April 2011.
 The album is a follow up to The Devil Wears Prada's 2009 album, "With Roots Above and Branches Below".
 Much like their previous efforts the album's lyrics were penned by lead vocalist Mike Hranica, whose lyrical direction focused on anti-idolatry concepts.
 The band's musical style changed after the success of the "Zombie EP", this led to, what Hranica described as; fusing the melodic elements of their previous studio albums with the ferocity of "Zombie".
