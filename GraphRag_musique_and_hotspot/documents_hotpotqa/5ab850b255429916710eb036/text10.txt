Pesäpallo (] ; Swedish: "boboll" , both names literally meaning "nest ball", also referred to as "Finnish baseball") is a fast-moving bat-and-ball sport that is often referred to as the national sport of Finland and has some presence in other countries including Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada's northern Ontario (the latter two countries have significant Nordic populations).
 The game is similar to brännboll, rounders, and lapta, as well as baseball.
