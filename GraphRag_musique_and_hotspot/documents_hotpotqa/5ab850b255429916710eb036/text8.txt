Brännboll (] ) (brennball or slåball ("hitball") in Norway; rundbold ("roundball") in Denmark; Brennball in Germany) is a game similar to rounders, baseball, lapta and pesäpallo played on amateur level throughout Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany, mostly on fields and in public parks, but it is also part of the PE curriculum in some areas.
 The name is derived from the act of catching a player between two bases at the end of a batting round, referred to as "burning" them ("bränna"), roughly equivalent to being run out in cricket or out in baseball.
 The world championship, called Brännbollscupen, is an annual event in the Swedish city of Umeå.
