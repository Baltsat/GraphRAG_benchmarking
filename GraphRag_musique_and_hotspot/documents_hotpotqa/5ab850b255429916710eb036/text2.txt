When a daily indexed unit of account or Daily Consumer Price Index (Daily CPI) or monetized daily indexed unit of account is used in contracts or in the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power accounting model, deferred payments and constant real value non-monetary items are indexed to the general price level in terms of a Daily Index such that changes in the inflation rate - in the case of monetary items - and the stable measuring unit assumption - in the case of constant real value non-monetary items - have no effect on the real value of these items.
 Non-indexed units, such as contracts written in nominal currency units and nominal monetary items, incur inflation or deflation risk in the case of monetary items.
 During all periods of inflation (low, high or hyperinflation), the debtor pays less in real terms than what both the debtor and creditor agreed at the original time of the contract/sale.
 On the other hand, in periods of deflation, the debtor pays more in real terms than the original agreed value.
 The opposite is true for creditors.
 Contracts and constant real value non-monetary items accounted in daily indexed units of account, Daily CPI or monetized daily indexed units of account incur no inflation or deflation risk, as the real value of payments and outstanding capital amounts remain constant over time while the nominal values are inflation- or deflation-indexed daily.
