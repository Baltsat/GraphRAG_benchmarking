Equipment for tea ceremony is called "dōgu" (道具; lit., "tools"), or more specifically "chadōgu" (茶道具; "tea tools").
 "Chadōgu" can be divided into five major categories: "sōshoku dōgu" (装飾道具; "decorative items"); "temae dōgu" (点前道具; "items for the tea-making and service"); "kaiseki dōgu" (懐石道具; "items for the "chakaiseki" meal"); "mizuya dōgu" (水屋道具; "items used in the preparation room"); and "machiai dōgu / roji" "dōgu" (待合道具・露地道具; "items for the waiting room" / "items for the "roji" garden").
 A wide range of "dōgu" is necessary for even the most basic tea ceremony.
 Generally, items which guests prepare themselves with for attending a chanoyu gathering are not considered as "chadōgu"; rather, the term fundamentally applies to items involved to "host" a chanoyu gathering.
 This article, however, includes all forms of implements and paraphernalia involved in the practice of "chanoyu".
