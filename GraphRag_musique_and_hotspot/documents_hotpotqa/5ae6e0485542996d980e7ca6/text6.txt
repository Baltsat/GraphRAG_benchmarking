Nuestra Belleza Latina 2009 is the third season of Nuestra Belleza Latina (Our Latin Beauty) premiered on March 2009.
 Auditions were once again held in five major US cities (Los Angeles, California; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and New York City, New York) and in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
 During the audition process, 75 young women were given passes to the semi-finals in Miami, Florida.
 With the twist of adding one more contestant named "La Intrusa" (Francheska Mattei).
 For several weeks, Francheska Mattei, a professional actress, posed as one of the contestants to know the rumors, secrets, and even gossip from the girls.
 The elimination process was quick, with 15 women leaving the first day, 40 on the second week, and finally 8 women were eliminated leaving the 12 finalists who will be moving into a Miami mansion where they will be living together for the rest of the competition.
 Each week, viewers will have a chance to vote for their favorite finalists.
 The three women with the least number of votes will then be in danger of being eliminated.
 However, two of the women in the bottom three will have the chance of being saved, one by her fellow finalists, and the other by the judges.
 This year they had an "Intrusa", the one that spilled the gossip about the contestants and it was Puerto Rican, Francheska Mattei.
