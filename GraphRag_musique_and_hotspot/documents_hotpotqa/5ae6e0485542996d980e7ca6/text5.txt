Donkey Kong (Japanese: ドンキーコング , Hepburn: Donkī Kongu ) is an arcade game released by Nintendo in 1981.
 An early example of the platform game genre, the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles.
 In the game, Mario (originally named Mr. Video and then Jumpman) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline (originally named Lady), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong.
 The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular and recognizable characters.
 "Donkey Kong" is one of the most important titles from the golden age of arcade video games, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time.
