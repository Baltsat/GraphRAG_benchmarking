FutureSex/LoveSounds is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake.
 It was released on September 8, 2006 by Jive Records and its affiliated label of the Zomba Group of Companies.
 During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his feelings on being unable to record any new material, and as he returned to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime record producer Timbaland, alongside the latter's colleague Danja.
 The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's Thomas Crown Studios.
 The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album "Justified" (2002), although "FutureSex/LoveSounds" has more diversity in music genres.
 It infuses R&B and pop with techno, funk, and elements of rock.
 The reprises and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team with the goal of channeling Timberlake's influences; including David Bowie and Prince.
