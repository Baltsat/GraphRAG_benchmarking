Yoga, rather than being the name for a singular lineage or even a specific practice, is a bracket term that covers a number of methodologies, each with a number of schools.
 Within the major branches of yoga such as haṭha, lāya, rāja, jñāna, and bhakti there are many different schools and lineages, both extant and defunct.
 Since the late 19th century, a great number of distinct new styles of "Yoga" have been introduced by individual teachers.
 There are also a number of schools and traditions that are occasionally referred to as yoga or yogic for their similar practices despite having no foundation in the Indian tradition such as Shin Shin Tōitsu-dō, and Daoyin.
