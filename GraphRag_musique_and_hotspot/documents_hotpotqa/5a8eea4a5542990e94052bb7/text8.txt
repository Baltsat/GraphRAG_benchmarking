Suorva or Suorvadammen (the Suorva Dam) is a small settlement situated at the southern parts of Akkajaure, in Stora Sjöfallet National Park, Sweden.
 The settlement can be reached by car (and bus, from Gällivare).
 It consists of a few houses and a dam operated by Vattenfall, which regulates the flow to the hydroelectric plant in Vietas located about 5 kilometers downstream.
 The road over the dam is normally open for hikers (not cars) and makes for a possible route into the northern parts of Sarek National Park which does not require using a boat.
