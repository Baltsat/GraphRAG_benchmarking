Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE.
 It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age).
 It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages.
