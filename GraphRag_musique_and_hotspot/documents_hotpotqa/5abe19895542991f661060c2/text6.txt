The State of Quán () was a small Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC) vassal state of Central China.
 A Marquisate, then Dukedom (侯), its rulers were descendants of Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC) ruler Wu Ding with the surname "Zi" (子).
 Quan was founded by Wen Ding’s son Quan Wending (权文丁) in the area of modern day Maliang Town (马良镇), Shayang County, Jingmen City, Hubei Province, next to what would later emerge as the State of Chu.
