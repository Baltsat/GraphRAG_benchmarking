Richard Hornsby & Sons was an engine and machinery manufacturer in Lincolnshire, England from 1828 until 1918.
 The company was a pioneer in the manufacture of the oil engine developed by Herbert Akroyd Stuart, which was marketed under the "Hornsby-Akroyd" name.
 The company developed an early track system for vehicles, selling the patent to Holt & Co. (predecessor to Caterpillar Inc.) in America.
 In 1918, Richard Hornsby & Sons became a subsidiary of the neighbouring engineering firm Rustons of Lincoln, to create "Ruston & Hornsby".
