Mount Hornsby ( ) is a prominent snow-capped mountain on the south side of the middle reaches of Sjogren Glacier, Trinity Peninsula, Antarctica.
 It was mapped from surveys by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (1960–61), and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, who designed and constructed several highly successful chain-track vehicles for the British War Office, the first "caterpillar tractors," in the years 1904–10.
