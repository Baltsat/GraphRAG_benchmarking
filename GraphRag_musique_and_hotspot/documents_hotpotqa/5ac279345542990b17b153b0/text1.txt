Richard Newsham (died 1743) was an English inventor.
 He took out 2 patents for fire engines in 1721 and 1725 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon dominated the fire engine market in England.
 The engine had two single-acting pistons and an air vessel placed in a tank which formed the frame of the machine.
 The pump was worked by people at the long cross handles.
 At the front of the engine, protected by a sheet of horn and a door, were directions for keeping the machine in order.
 The cistern could hold about 170 USgal of water pumping up to 100 USgal a minute.
 New York City imported its first two fire engines from Newsham in 1731.
 In 1737 Newsham made a manual fire pump for the Parish of Bray in Berkshire.
