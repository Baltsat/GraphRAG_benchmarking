The Dream of Gerontius, Op. 38, is a work for voices and orchestra in two parts composed by Sir Edward Elgar in 1900, to text from the poem by John Henry Newman.
 It relates the journey of a pious man's soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into Purgatory.
 Elgar disapproved of the use of the term "oratorio" for the work, though his wishes are not always followed.
 The piece is widely regarded as Elgar's finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece.
