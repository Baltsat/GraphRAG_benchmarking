The 2010â€“11 Southampton F.C. season was the club's 71st and sixth consecutive season in The Football League, and their second in League One.
 Having narrowly missed out on the chance of promotion the previous season, Southampton were again seeking to reclaim their place in The Championship by being promoted in 2011.
 Before the commencement of the campaign, Southampton were slated as the favourites to win the League One title by a number of bookmakers, commentators and fans.
