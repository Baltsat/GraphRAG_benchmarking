Week End Tour was the name given to French pop singer Lorie's second concert tour, inspired by her hit single "Week End".
 On 4 October 2004, a live recording of the show was released in two versions, as with the famous singer's previous live effort, "Live Tour": a regular jewel case release containing the CD and a DVD and a limited edition cardboard box also containing a poster and a watch featuring the blonde songstress during her performances. On 12 June 2004, a filmed version of the show was released on DVD, once again in two versions.
 The limited edition DVD additionally contained a bonus disc with additional special features, as well has a new, double-sided poster and a removable tattoo of the singer's name.
