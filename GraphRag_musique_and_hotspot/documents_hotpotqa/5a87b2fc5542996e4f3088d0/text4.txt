Un Regard 9 is the title of both the CD and DVD from Lara Fabian's 2005/2006 tour of the same name which followed her 2005 studio release, titled "9".
 The CD and DVD were both released separately and together as a limited edition box set.
 The CD and DVD were both recorded live on 29 March 2006 at the Zenith in Paris.
 The CD presents 15 live performances plus a brand new song, "Aime," recorded in a studio in Montreal.
 This song has been recorded in both English and French, though the latter version is the only one officially released so far.
 It was initially presented live during a few concerts in Belgium as gift for her native Belgium fans, but the enthusiastic response and feedback was so huge that Lara felt she should record the song and include it on a forthcoming release.
