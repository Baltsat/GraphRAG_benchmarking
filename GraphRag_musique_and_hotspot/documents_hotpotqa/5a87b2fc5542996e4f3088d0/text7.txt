Moonlight Waltz Tour 2011 is a live CD and DVD from the Italian gothic metal band Theatres des Vampires.
 It is the first all-in-one live CD and DVD release from the band, though Theatres des Vampires have released one live CD (Desire of Damnation) and one live DVD (The Addiction Tour 2006), separately.
 In addition to the live tracks, the CD contains three new studio songs from The Cult of Lamia soundtrack.
 The limited edition package also includes a 40-page book.
