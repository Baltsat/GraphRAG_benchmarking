Philippine Idol is the first version of the Idol series in the Philippines, the 35th country in the world to air a local "Idol" adaptation and the sixth in Asia.
 The franchise was first awarded by FremantleMedia, 19 Entertainment and CKX, Inc. to ABC Development Corporation (ABC now TV5) in 2006 and then to GMA Network in 2008.
 Just like the premise of original show "Pop Idol", "Philippine Idol" aims to find the best singer in the country who can be defined as the "national" singer.
 Local television personality Ryan Agoncillo hosted the program.
 Ryan Cayabyab (musical composer), Pilita Corrales (singer, known as Asia's Queen of Songs) and Francis Magalona (rapper and producer) were also judges of the show.
 Agoncillo, Corrales and Magalona auditioned to be part of the program, while Cayabyab was chosen by the program's producers.
 Meanwhile, actress Heart Evangelista hosted the daily updates program "I â™¥ Philippine Idol: Exclusive".
 Composer Mel Villena was the show's musical director.
