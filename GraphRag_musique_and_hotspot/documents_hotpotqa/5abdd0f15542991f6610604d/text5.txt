Yehuda Avner (Hebrew: יהודה אבנר‎ ; December 30, 1928 – March 24, 2015) was an Israeli prime ministerial advisor, diplomat, and author.
 He served as Speechwriter and Secretary to Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Levi Eshkol, and as Advisor to Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin, Menachem Begin, and Shimon Peres.
 Avner served in diplomatic positions at the Israeli Consulate in New York, and the Israeli Embassy to the US in Washington, DC, and as Israel’s Ambassador to Britain, Ireland and Australia.
 In 2010, he turned his insider stories about Israeli politics and diplomacy into a bestselling book, "The Prime Ministers", which subsequently became the basis for a two-part documentary movie.
 In 2015, his novel, "The Ambassador", which Avner co-authored with thriller writer Matt Rees, was posthumously published.
