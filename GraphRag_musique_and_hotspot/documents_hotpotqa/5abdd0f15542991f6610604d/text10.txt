Engelbert Dollfuss (German: "Engelbert Dollfuß" , ] ; 4 October 1892 – 25 July 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman.
 Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government.
 In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers.
 Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of “austrofascism” through the authoritarian "First of May Constitution".
 Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934.
 His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria in 1938.
