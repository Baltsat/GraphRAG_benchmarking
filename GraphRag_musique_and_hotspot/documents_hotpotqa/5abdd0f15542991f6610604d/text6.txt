Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference were biennial meetings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominion members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
 Seventeen Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences were held between 1944 and 1969.
 As well, the prime ministers met for a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.
 These series of conferences were a continuation and regularisation of the earlier Imperial Conferences which had been held periodically from 1887 to 1937.
 Since 1971, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings have been held.
