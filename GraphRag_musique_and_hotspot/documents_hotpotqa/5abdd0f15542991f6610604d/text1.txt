General elections were held in India in 1996 to elect the members of the 11th Lok Sabha contested by the Congress Party and Bharatiya Janata Party.
 The result of the election was a hung parliament with neither top two leading securing a mandate.
 The Bharatiya Janata Party formed a short lived government.
 United Front, consisting of non Congress, non BJP was created and secured support from 332 members out of the 545 seats in the Lok Sabha, resulting in H.D. Deve Gowda from the Janata Dal being the 11th Prime Minister of India.
 The 11th Lok Sabha produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998.
