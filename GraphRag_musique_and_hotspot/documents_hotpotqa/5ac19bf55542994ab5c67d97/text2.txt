"High Water (For Charley Patton)" is a song by Bob Dylan, released on his 31st studio album ""Love and Theft"" in 2001.
 The song draws its title from the Charley Patton song "High Water Everywhere", and is meant as a tribute to that bluesman.
 It is one of many songs based on the 1927 Louisiana flood.
 Other songs about the event include Memphis Minnie's "When the Levee Breaks" (also recorded by Dylan on his "Modern Times" album as "The Levee's Gonna Break"), and Randy Newman's "Louisiana 1927".
