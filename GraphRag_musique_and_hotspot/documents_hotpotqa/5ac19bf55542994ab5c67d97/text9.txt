"Mama, You Been on My Mind" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan.
 Written in 1964 during a trip to Europe, the song dealt with his recent breakup with his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo.
 Dylan first recorded the song in June of that year during a session for his album "Another Side of Bob Dylan".
 However, the song was not included on the album, and Dylan's version remained unreleased until 1991.
 In total, in the 1990s and 2000s four versions were put out on Dylan's "Bootleg Series" of releases, including two live performances with Joan Baez from 1964 and 1975.
