"To Ramona" is a folk waltz written by Bob Dylan for his fourth studio album, "Another Side of Bob Dylan".
 The melody is taken from traditional Mexican folk music.
 "To Ramona" is also a nod to Rex Griffin's 1937 song "The Last Letter".
 The song is one of several on the album to highlight the more personal, less political, side of Dylan's songwriting that would become more prominent in the future.
 The song also makes allusions to Dylan's personal relationship with fellow folk singer Joan Baez, at the time of its composition and subsequent release.
 It is another example of the G, G6, G7 harmonic motif Dylan uses pervasively on the record.
