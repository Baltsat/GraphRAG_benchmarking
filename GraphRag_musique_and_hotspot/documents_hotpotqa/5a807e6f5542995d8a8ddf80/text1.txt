HSwMS "Gustav V" was a "Sverige"-class coastal defence ship of the Swedish Navy.
 The vessel was the third and last ship in the Sverige class along with HMS Sverige and HMS Drottning Victoria.
 Gustav V was launched on September 15, 1917 at Kockums in Malmö and delivered to the Navy on January 9, 1922.
 The design consisted of four 28 cm cannons and a secondary armament of eight 15.2 cm cannons.
 During the interwar period, the ship underwent several modernizations and was one of the most powerful vessels in the fleet during the Second World War.
 The ship was put in reserve in 1948, was decommissioned in 1957 and was later sold for scrapping in Karlskrona.
 However, the ship remained at Berga Academy of War as of 1968.
 Two of the ship's 15.2 cm guns are preserved in the battery at Häggmansberget in the defensive Kalix Line, around Kalix.
