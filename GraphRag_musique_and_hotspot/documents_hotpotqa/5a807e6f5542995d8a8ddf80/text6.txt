HMS "Valiant" was the second ship of the "Hector"-class armoured frigates ordered by the Royal Navy in 1861.
 Her builders went bankrupt shortly after she was laid down, which significantly delayed her completion.
 After being launched in 1863, she waited a further five years to receive her guns due to supply issues.
 Upon being commissioned in 1868 the ship was assigned as the First Reserve guard ship for Southern Ireland, where she remained until she was decommissioned in 1885.
 "Valiant" was hulked in 1897 as part of the stoker training school HMS "Indus" before becoming a storeship for kite balloons during the First World War.
 The ship was converted to a floating oil tank in 1926 and served in that role until sold for scrap in 1956.
