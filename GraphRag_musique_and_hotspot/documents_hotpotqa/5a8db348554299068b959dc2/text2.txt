Gallo Record Company is the largest (and oldest independent) record label in South Africa.
 It is based in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is owned by Times Media Group (formerly Johnnic Communications and Avusa).
 The current Gallo Record Company is a hybrid of two rival South African record labels between the 1940s and 1980s: the original Gallo Africa (1926–85) and G.R.C. (Gramophone Record Company, 1939–85).
 In 1985 Gallo Africa acquired G.R.C.; as a result, Gallo Africa became known as "Gallo-GRC".
 Five years after the acquisition, the company was renamed "Gallo Record Company".
