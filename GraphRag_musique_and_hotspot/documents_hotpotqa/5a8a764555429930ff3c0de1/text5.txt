Bill Pollack was a competitor in the early days of the post World War II California sports car culture.
 Starting his racing career in 1950, he would go on to win the Pebble Beach in an Allard J2 that was owned by Tom Carstens'.
 Bill also won at other California venues of that time: Pebble Beach, Golden Gate Park, Reno, Torrey Pines, Stockton, Madera, Willow Springs, Palm Springs, and the Santa Barbara road races.
 He was a contemporary of Phil Hill, who went on to become the first and only U.S. born world grand prix champion.
