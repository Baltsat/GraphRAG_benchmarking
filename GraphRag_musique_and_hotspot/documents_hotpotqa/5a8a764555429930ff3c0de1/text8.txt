The 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 68th season of FIA Formula One motor racing.
 It featured the 2014 Formula One World Championship, a motor racing championship for Formula One cars, recognised by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars.
 The season started in Australia on 16 March and concluded in Abu Dhabi on 23 November.
 In the nineteen Grands Prix of the season, a total of eleven teams and twenty-four drivers competed for the World Drivers' and World Constructors' championships.
 It was the first Formula One season since to see an accident with ultimately fatal consequences as Jules Bianchi succumbed to the injuries he sustained during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.
 He died on 17 July 2015 after spending nine months in a coma following the accident.
