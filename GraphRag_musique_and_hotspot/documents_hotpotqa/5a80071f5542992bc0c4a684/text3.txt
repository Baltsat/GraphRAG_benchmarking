Lara Croft Go is a 2015 turn-based puzzle video game in the "Tomb Raider" series.
 The player moves Lara Croft as a puzzle piece through a board game while avoiding obstacles and manipulating the environment.
 The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit "Lara Croft Go"'s time-independent gameplay.
 Square Enix Montreal developed the game as a spiritual successor to its 2014 "Hitman Go", based on another Square Enix franchise.
 The company released "Lara Croft Go" in August 2015 for Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone devices.
 A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was unveiled in November 2016.
