Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android and, iOS through digital distribution.
 It is part of the "Tomb Raider" series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the "Tomb Raider" brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay.
 In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec.
 They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke.
 A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara.
