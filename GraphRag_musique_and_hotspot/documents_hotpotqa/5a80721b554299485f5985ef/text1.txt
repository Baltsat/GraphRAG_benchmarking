The Livesey Hall War Memorial commemorates the fallen of World War I and World War II who had been employed by the South Suburban Gas Company of London.
 It is also a tribute to those employees who served in the wars.
 The monument was designed and executed by British sculptor Sydney March, of the March family of artists.
