The Acad√©mie Diplomatique Internationale (ADI; english "International Diplomatic Academy") is an international organization based in Paris, France, focused on modern diplomacy and international affairs.
 Founded in 1926, the ADI was, along with Chatham House in London and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, one of the first policy institutions devoted to the sustained study and analysis of international relations.
 Early members included Aristide Briand, Nicolae Titulescu, Gustav Stresemann, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 Under the Presidency of His Highness the Aga Khan IV, who was elected in 2000, the ADI has focused its efforts on diplomatic training and emerging dynamics in international relations and modern diplomacy.
