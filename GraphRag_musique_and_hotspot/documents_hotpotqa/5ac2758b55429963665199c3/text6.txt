Gheorghe I. Tătărescu (also known as "Guță Tătărescu", with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name; 2 November 1886 – 28 March 1957) was a Romanian politician who served 36th Prime Minister of Romania (1934–1937; 1939–1940), three times as Minister of Foreign Affairs ("interim" in 1934 and 1938; appointed to the office in 1945-1947), and once as Minister of War (1934).
 Representing the "young liberals" faction inside the National Liberal Party (PNL), Tătărescu began his political career as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca, becoming noted for his anti-Communism and, in time, for his conflicts with the PNL's leader Dinu Brătianu and the Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu.
 During his first time in office, he moved closer to King Carol II, leading an ambivalent policy toward the fascist Iron Guard and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the authoritarian and corporatist regime around the National Renaissance Front.
 In 1940, he accepted the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and consequently had to resign.
