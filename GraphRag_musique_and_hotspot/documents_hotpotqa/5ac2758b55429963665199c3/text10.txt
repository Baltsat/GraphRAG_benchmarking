The League of Nations (abbreviated as LN in English, "La Société des Nations " ] abbreviated as SDN or SdN in French) was an intergovernmental organisation founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War.
 It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace.
 Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration.
 Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe.
 At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members.
