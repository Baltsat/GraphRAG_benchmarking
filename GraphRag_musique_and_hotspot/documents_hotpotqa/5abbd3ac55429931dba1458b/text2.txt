The Crystal River Energy Complex consists of five power-generating plants on a 4,700 acre (1,900 hectare) site near the mouth of the Crystal River in Citrus County, Florida.
 Crystal River 1, 2, 4, and 5 are fossil fuel power plants, while Crystal River 3 is the sole nuclear power plant on the site.
 The complex was developed in the early 1960s by the Florida Power Corporation and sold to Progress Energy Inc in 2000.
 Following Progress Energy's merger with Duke Energy in 2012, the facility is owned and operated by Duke Energy.
