Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline is a proposed natural gas pipeline to run from central Alabama through southwest Georgia to Orange County.
 A minority stake in the venture is owned by NextEra Energy and Duke Energy.
 The pipeline has been being planned since before 2011.
 In July 2013 it was announced that Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) jointly awarded its parent corporation, NextEra Energy and Spectra Energy the bid to build the pipeline.
 In May 2015, Duke Energy bought an interest in the venture.
 Construction began in September 2016.
 The pipeline is currently scheduled to be in service by June 2017.
