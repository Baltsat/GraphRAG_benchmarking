 He is perhaps best known for playing the polished villain the Sheriff of Nottingham in the 1950s TV series "The Adventures of Robin Hood", with Richard Greene playing Robin Hood.
 In 1951, Wheatley had played Sherlock Holmes in the first TV series about the fictional detective, but no recordings of it are known to exist.
