In 1991, seven years after meeting in a summer stock production of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, Dan Murphy and Sharon Maroney (married), along with fellow performer Matthew Ryan (a native of Tigard, OR) and his partner Joseph Morkys, decided to move from New York City to start a summer stock theatre in Tigard.
 The team pooled their savings of $21,000 and in November 1991, Broadway Rose Theatre Company was incorporated as a 501(c)(3).
 In the summer of 1992, the first season of Broadway Rose Theatre Company was performed at the Deb Fennell Auditorium at Tigard High School.
 The company produced five mainstage shows and a children's show in eight weeks, with an average audience of 32 people per performance.
 The company lost $8,700 in its first season, but the following year the fledgling company received a $3,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission (a forerunner of the Regional Arts & Culture Council), to help bring the organization out of debt.
 In 1993, the company produced "Oklahoma!
" with no funds—putting the entire payroll on Dan's personal credit card.
 The situation resolved itself as audiences picked up.
 In 1994, the company received a $4,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission.
 Audiences averaged 132 people per performance that year—a 313 percent increase from 1992.
 In 1995, The Collins Foundation provided the company a $5,000 grant, allowing Sharon Maroney to become the company's first paid employee.
 Platt Electric Supply became Broadway Rose's first title sponsor in 1996, providing a new level of stable funding (they would stay on as a title sponsor through 2012 when Harvey Platt sold the company).
 In 1997, co-founders Matthew Ryan and Joe Morkys left Broadway Rose and returned to New York.
 That year Broadway Rose held its first drama camp for young performers aged 8–11.
 Also in 1997, Shoshana Bean, who would later become famous for portraying Elphaba on Broadway in the musical "Wicked""," starred in the Broadway Rose production of "Bye Bye Birdie."
 The company's offices moved from Dan and Sharon's home to a Platt Electric Supply branch office in 1999.
 Later that year, the Sherwood Arts Council contracted Broadway Rose to produce "Broadway Goes Hollywood", a fundraiser for SAC held at the historic Robin Hood Theater in Sherwood, OR.
 Broadway Rose's annual budget rose to around $175,000 with ticket sales accounting for just under half of the total, and Dan's general manager position officially became funded, making him an employee rather than a volunteer.
