The Second Battle of Caloocan, alternately called the Second Battle of Manila, was fought from February 22 to 24, 1899, in Caloocan during the Philippineâ€“American War.
 The battle featured a Filipino counterattack aimed at gaining Manila from the Americans.
 This counterattack failed to regain Manila mainly because of lack of coordination among Filipino units and lack of artillery support.
