The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation (Tsėhéstáno in Cheyenne, formerly named the Tongue River Indian Reservation) is home of the federally recognized Northern Cheyenne Tribe.
 Located in southeastern Montana, the reservation is approximately 444,000 acres in size and home to approximately 5,000 Cheyenne people.
 The tribal and government headquarters are in Lame Deer, which is also the home of the annual Northern Cheyenne Pow wow.
 The reservation is bounded on the east by the Tongue River and on the west by the Crow Reservation.
 There are small parcels of non-contiguous off-reservation trust lands in Meade County, South Dakota, northeast of the city of Sturgis.
 Its timbered ridges that extend into northwestern South Dakota are part of Custer National Forest and it is approximately 40 mi east of the site of the 1876 Battle of the Greasy Grass (known to most Americans as the Battle of the Little Bighorn).
