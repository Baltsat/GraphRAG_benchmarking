The Naval Battle of Campeche took place on April 30, 1843, and May 16, 1843.
 The battle featured the most advanced warships of its day, including the Mexican steamer "Guadalupe" and the equally formidable "Moctezuma" which engaged a squadron of vessels from the Republic of Yucatan and the Republic of Texas.
 The latter force consisted of the Texas Navy flagship sloop-of-war "Austin", commanded by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, the brig "Wharton", and several schooners and five gunboats from the Republic of Yucatán, commanded by former Texas Navy Captain James D. Boylan.
 Texas had declared its independence in 1836 but by 1843 Mexico had refused to recognize it.
 In Yucatán, a similar rebellion had begun and was fought off-and-on from 1836 to 1846.
 The battle ended in a combined Yucatecan and Texan victory.
