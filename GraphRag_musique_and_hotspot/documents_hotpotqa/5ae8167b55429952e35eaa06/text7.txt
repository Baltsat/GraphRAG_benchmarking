The Battle of Kuwait International Airport occurred on February 27, 1991 during the 1st Gulf War.
 It was a tank battle between the United States and Ba'athist Iraq.
 Despite being a very large battle it is often overlooked compared to the other battles which took place during the war.
 No less than elements of 18 divisions total participated in this battle.
 U.S. Army Special Forces units and multiple Iraqi Commando units were also in theatre.
 In reality the battle took place over a span of three days despite the primary battle at Kuwait International Airport lasting only one day.
 Much of the combat actually took place en route to the airport.
 The battle featured the "Reveille Engagement" which went on to become the biggest and fastest tank battle in United States Marine Corps' entire history.
