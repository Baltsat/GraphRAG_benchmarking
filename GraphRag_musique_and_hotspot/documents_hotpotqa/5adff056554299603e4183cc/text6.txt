The Global Philanthropy Forum (GPF) is an initiative of the World Affairs Council which acts as a peer-learning network of philanthropists — grant-makers and social investors — committed to advancing equity and opportunity in the developing world.
 Its community of donors and social investors work on international causes through strategic philanthropy, operating on principles that overlap with those of impact investing.
