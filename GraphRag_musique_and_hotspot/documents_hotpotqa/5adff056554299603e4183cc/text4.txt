The Chronicle of Market Prices, designated "Chronicle 23" in Grayson’s "Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles", its first publishing, and Mesopotamian Chronicle 50: “Chronicle of Market Prices” in Glassner’s "Mesopotamian Chronicles" is an ancient Mesopotamian Chronicle laconically recording the cost of various commodities from the beginning of the second until the early-mid first millennium BC.
 The moniker is a modern designation as it had no colophon to identify it in antiquity.
