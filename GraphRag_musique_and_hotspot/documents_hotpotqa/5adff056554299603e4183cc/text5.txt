The Morning Chronicle was a newspaper founded in 1769 in London, England, and published under various owners until 1862, when its publication was suspended, with two subsequent attempts at continued publication.
 From 28 June 1769 to March 1789 it was published under the name "The Morning Chronicle, and London Advertiser".
 From 1789 to its final publication in 1865, it was published under the name "The Morning Chronicle".
 It was notable for having been the first steady employer of essayist William Hazlitt as a political reporter, and the first steady employer of Charles Dickens as a journalist; for publishing the articles by Henry Mayhew that were collected and published in book format in 1851 as "London Labour and the London Poor"; and for publishing other major writers, such as John Stuart Mill.
