Adolf Hitler signed a memorandum authorizing involuntary euthanasia in October 1939 to serve as the legal basis for Aktion T4, the Nazi forced euthanasia program.
 Its purpose was to assure the doctors and nurses who took part in the euthanasia program would not be prosecuted for murder.
 During the postwar trials of these same individuals, they attempted to use this decree as a justification for their actions.
