Karl Brandt (January 8, 1904 – June 2, 1948) was a German physician and "Schutzstaffel" (SS) officer in Nazi Germany.
 Trained in surgery, Brandt joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and became Adolf Hitler's escort physician in August 1934.
 A member of Hitler's inner circle at the Berghof, he was selected by Philipp Bouhler, the head of Hitler's Chancellery, to administer the "Aktion T4" euthanasia program.
 Brandt was later appointed the Reich Commissioner of Sanitation and Health ("Bevollmächtigter für das Sanitäts- und Gesundheitswesen").
 Accused of involvement in human experimentation and other war crimes, Brandt was indicted in late 1946 and faced trial before a U.S. military tribunal along with 22 others in "United States of America v. Karl Brandt, et al".
 He was convicted, sentenced to death, and later hanged on June 2, 1948.
