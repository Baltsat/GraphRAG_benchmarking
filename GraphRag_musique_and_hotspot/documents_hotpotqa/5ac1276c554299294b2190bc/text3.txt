Am Spiegelgrund was the name of a children's clinic in Vienna where 789 children were killed under the Nazi Regime Children's Euthanasia Program, also known as Aktion T4.
 Between 1940-1945, the clinic operated as part of the psychological institution “Am Steinhof” (renamed the Otto Wagner Clinic) on the Baumgartner Höhe, now located in Penzing, the 14th district of Vienna.
 This clinic was divided into a reform school and a sanatorium for children, which included a so-called Children’s Ward, where sick, disabled, and otherwise ‘un-educable’ adolescents were abused and subjected to harsh medical experiments.
 Some died by lethal injection and gas poisoning; others by disease, undernourishment, exposure to the elements, and 'accidents' relating to their conditions.
 The brains of up to 800 victims were preserved in jars and housed in the hospital for decades.
