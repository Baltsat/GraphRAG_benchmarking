Aktion T4 (German, ] ) was a postwar name for mass murder through involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany.
 The name T4 is an abbreviation of "Tiergartenstra√üe 4", a street address of the Chancellery department set up in the spring of 1940, in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten, which recruited and paid personnel associated with T4.
 Certain German physicians were authorized to select patients "deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination" and then administer to them a "mercy death" ("Gnadentod") .
 In October 1939 Adolf Hitler signed a "euthanasia decree" backdated to 1 September 1939 that authorized his personal physician Karl Brandt and "Reichsleiter" Philipp Bouhler to implement the programme.
