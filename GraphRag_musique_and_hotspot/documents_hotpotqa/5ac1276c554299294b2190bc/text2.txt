Heinrich Gross (14 November 1915 â€“ 15 December 2005) was an Austrian psychiatrist, medical doctor and neurologist, a reputed expert as a leading court-appointed psychiatrist, ill-famed for his proven involvement in the killing of at least nine children with physical, mental and/or emotional/behavioral characteristics considered "unclean" by the Nazi regime, under its Euthanasia Program.
 His role in hundreds of other cases of infanticide is unclear.
 Gross was head of the Spiegelgrund children's psychiatric clinic for two years during World War II.
