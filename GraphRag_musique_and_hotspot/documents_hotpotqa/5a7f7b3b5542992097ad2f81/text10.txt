Tudor's Biscuit World is a restaurant chain based in Huntington, West Virginia, most commonly found in West Virginia.
 Many West Virginia locations share a building with Gino's Pizza and Spaghetti, although the chain is more extensive than Gino's (which is exclusive to West Virginia), having locations in southern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and southwestern Virginia.
 In 2016 a franchise was opened in Panama City, Florida.
 Tudor's serves biscuits, biscuit sandwiches, homestyle breakfasts and dinners, muffins, and several side dishes.
 The chain was originally based in Charleston, West Virginia and many of the biscuit sandwiches are named for sports teams of interest in that area, including teams at Marshall University, West Virginia University, and The University of Charleston.
