The Ohio Union serves as a student activity center for students of The Ohio State University.
 When the Union was established in 1910, it was the first student union at a public university.
 The Ohio Union provides facilities for student activities, organizations/events, and campus and community interaction.
 Many student services and programs are housed in the union, along with dining and recreational facilities.
 It also serves as the home base for the D-Tix program, which provides discounted tickets to students.
 On March 29, 2010, the current Ohio Union was erected.
