"I Get Up" was a single that was released in 2003 by Australian band INXS.
 The song was written by Andrew Farriss and Jon Stevens.
 It was the first new material by INXS since their former frontman Michael Hutchence died by suicide on 22 November 1997.
 The lead singer on "I Get Up" is former Noiseworks frontman Jon Stevens.
 It is the only studio recorded material by INXS with Stevens singing.
 Stevens resigned from INXS by the end of 2003 because of "differing views" about the bands' future.
