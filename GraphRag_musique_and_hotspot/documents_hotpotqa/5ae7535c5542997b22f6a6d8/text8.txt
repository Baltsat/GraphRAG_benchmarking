The 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game, also known as the 2011 National Hockey League All-Star Game presented by Discover, was the National Hockey League's (NHL) annual All-Star Game played on January 30, 2011.
 The game took place during the 2010â€“11 NHL season at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, home of the Carolina Hurricanes.
 Originally, the Game was supposed to be hosted by the Phoenix Coyotes, but due to ownership issues, the NHL decided to move the game.
 After bidding for the game reopened, it was awarded to Carolina and fulfilled a nine-year-old promise made to the franchise by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.
