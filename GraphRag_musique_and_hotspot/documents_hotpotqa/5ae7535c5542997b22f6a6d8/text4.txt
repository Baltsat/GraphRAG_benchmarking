The NBL Canada All-Star Game is an exhibition game hosted by the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL), currently matching a group of players from the Central Division against a group from the Atlantic Division.
 The first All-Star game took place at the Halifax Metro Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia on April 1, 2012.
 In the inaugural game, the format did not take divisions into account and randomly divided players under captains Joey Haywood and Eddie Smith.
 As of 2014, the players are decided on the coaches' votes.
 No All-Star game took place for the 2014â€“15 NBL Canada season.
 The game takes place alongside multiple other competitions, together known as All-Star Weekend.
 These competitions include the Three-Point Long Distance Shootout and the Slam Dunk Championship.
 Neither event took place in 2015.
