The 63rd National Hockey League All-Star Game, also known as the 2018 NHL All-Star Game, will be held at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, home of the Tampa Bay Lightning on January 28, 2018.
 Tampa last held the NHL All Star Game in 1999.
 The All-Star Game will be played in lieu of NHL participation in the 2018 Olympics, as the NHL Board of Governors ruled against interrupting the season to send players to PyeongChang from 10â€“25 February.
