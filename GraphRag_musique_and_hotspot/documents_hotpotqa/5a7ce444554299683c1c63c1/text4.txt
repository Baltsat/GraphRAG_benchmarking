Still at Large is the third and final album released by Crime Boss.
 Following the release of his successful second album, "Conflicts & Confusion", Crime Boss left Suave House Records and formed his own independent label called Crime Lab Records and released "Still at Large" through it.
 Though his previous two albums were produced by Suave House's T-Mix, Crime Boss himself handled a majority of the album's production. '
