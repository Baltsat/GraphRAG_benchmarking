Johnny Jack Nounes, also known as the "Beau Brummell of Galveston", was an organized crime boss in Galveston, Texas, United States, during the early 1900s.
 He, with one-armed George Musey, led the Downtown Gang, one of the two gangs which controlled most of the Galveston Crime Syndicate until the early 1930s.
 They fought for control of the island against the rival Beach Gang led by Ollie Quinn and Dutch Voight.
 As the prohibition era began, his gang came to be one of the dominant forces in the Galveston Crime Syndicate.
 Galveston became the main port of entry for liquor supply in Texas and many parts of the Midwest.
