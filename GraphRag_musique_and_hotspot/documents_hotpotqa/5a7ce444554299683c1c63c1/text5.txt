James J. Marcello (born December 13, 1943), also known variously as Little Jimmy, Jimmy Light and as Jimmy the Man Marcello, is an imprisoned crime boss who was a front boss for the Chicago Outfit criminal organization in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.
 Organized crime observers identified Marcello as a figurehead during that period while the organization's day-to-day operations actually were run by John “No Nose” DiFronzo, Joseph “Joey the Clown” Lombardo, Joseph “Joe the Builder” Andriacchi and Angelo J. LaPietra.
 Marcello is the Cousin of Michael Hayes Marcello, and a cousin of Robert Urbinatti.
 He is also the father of Rocco Marcello.
