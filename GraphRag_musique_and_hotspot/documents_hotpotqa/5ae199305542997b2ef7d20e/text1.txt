A comic book convention or comic con is an event with a primary focus on comic books and comic book culture, in which comic book fans gather to meet creators, experts, and each other.
 Commonly, comic conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels, or college campuses.
 They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating in cosplay than most other types of fan conventions. Comic book conventions are also used as a vehicle for industry, in which publishers, distributors, and retailers represent their comic-related releases.
 Comic book conventions may be considered derivatives of science-fiction conventions, which began in the late 1930s.
