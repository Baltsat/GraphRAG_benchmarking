Sheena, Queen of the Jungle is a fictional American comic book jungle girl heroine, originally published primarily by Fiction House.
 She was the first female comic book character with her own title, with her 1937 (in Great Britain; 1938 in the United States) premiere preceding "Wonder Woman" #1 (cover-dated Dec. 1941).
 Sheena inspired a wealth of similar comic book jungle queens.
 She was predated in literature by Rima, the Jungle Girl, introduced in the 1904 William Henry Hudson novel "Green Mansions".
 Sheena was ranked 59th in "Comics Buyer's Guide"s "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.
