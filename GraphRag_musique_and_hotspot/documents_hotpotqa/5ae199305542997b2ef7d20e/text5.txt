Bratslav (Ukrainian: Брацлав ; Polish: "Bracław" ; Yiddish: בראָסלעוו‎ , "Broslev", today also pronounced Breslev or "Breslov" as the name of a Hasidic group, which originated from this town) is an urban-type settlement in Ukraine, located in Nemyriv Raion of Vinnytsia Oblast, by the Southern Bug river.
 It is a medieval European city and a regional center of the Eastern Podolia region (see Bratslav Voivodeship) founded by government of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, which dramatically lost its importance during the 19th-20th centuries.
