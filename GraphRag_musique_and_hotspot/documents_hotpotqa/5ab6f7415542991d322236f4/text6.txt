Markus Vogel (born January 12, 1984) is a World Cup alpine ski racer from the Canton of Nidwalden in Switzerland, who specializes in the Slalom discipline.
 He made his World Cup debut in January 2008 in his home race at Adelboden where he skied out of the first run.
 A week later in the slalom in Wengen, Vogel managed to qualify for the second run in 29th place from a start number of 62 but was unable to finish the second run.
 He did not finish the first run of his other four races in 2008.
 In fact it was over a year until Vogel picked up his first World Cup points with a 19th-place finish in Kitzb√ºhel.
 The 2010 season was another disappointing one, with Vogel spending most of his time in FIS Races and European Cup level.
 After this period, Vogel came back strongly at the end of the next season and earned himself a place in the Swiss World Championship team in 2011.
 In 2012, he was Switzerland's top slalom skier with the injury to Marc Gini.
 Vogel was also selected to the World Championship team in 2013, where he finished 17th in the Slalom.
