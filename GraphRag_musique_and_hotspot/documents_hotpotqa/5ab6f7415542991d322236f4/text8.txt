The Rugby League World Cup is an international rugby league tournament, contested by national teams of the Rugby League International Federation, which was first held in France in 1954, the first World Cup in either rugby code.
 The idea of a rugby league world cup tournament was first mooted in the 1930s with the French proposing holding a tournament in 1931, and again in 1951.
 The fourteen tournaments held to date have been at intervals ranging from two to eight years, and have featured a number of different formats.
 So far three nations have won the competition (Australia ten times, Great Britain three times and New Zealand once).
 Australia, France and New Zealand are the only teams to have played in all tournaments (Great Britain has been split into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since 1995, while England and Wales had previously competed as separate teams in the 1975 World Cup).
 Since 2000, the RLIF has also organised World Cups for women, students and other categories.
 The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in England and Wales and won by Australia.
