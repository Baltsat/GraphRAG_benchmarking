The Jeguk Sinmun ("Imperial Post"; 1898-1910) was a Seoul-based Korean language newspaper founded in 1898 by Yi Jong-myeon.
 It was published using the purely vernacular Hangeul script and attracted a largely lower or middle class and female readership.
 It was less political than the other papers of the period, concentrating instead on social issues.
 One of its early reporters was the young Syngman Rhee.
