The term celesbian (a portmanteau of "celebrity" and "lesbian") originally referred to a female celebrity known or reputed to be a lesbian and popular within the LGBT community.
 Celesbianism as a Western media phenomenon came into vogue in 2008, when several female celebrities presented themselves as lesbians.
 The term was first used by New Yorkers Pam Franco and Susan Levine, a disk jockey.
 It was used in a full-page ad in a lesbian nightlife magazine, "GO MAGAZINE".
 The ad was for the Mz Hip and Fit NY contest, the idea of Denise Cohen of Denco Designs & Events.
 The contest was a search for the hottest lesbian in the United States.
 The term "celesbian" was used for the celebrity lesbian judges.
