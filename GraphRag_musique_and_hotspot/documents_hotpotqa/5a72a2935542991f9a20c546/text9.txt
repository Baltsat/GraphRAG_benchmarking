Shōjo, shojo, or shoujo manga (少女漫画 , shōjo manga ) is manga aimed at a teenage female readership.
 The name romanizes the Japanese 少女 (shōjo), literally "young woman".
 Shōjo manga covers many subjects in a variety of narrative styles, from historical drama to science fiction, often with a focus on romantic relationships or emotions.
 Strictly speaking, however, shōjo manga does not comprise a style or genre, but rather indicates a target demographic.
