Femme is a lesbian sexual identity that was created in the working class lesbian bar culture of the 1950s.
 It is a term used to distinguish feminine lesbian and bisexual women from their butch/stud lesbian counterparts and partners.
 Today the term is still used in this way but in recent years - following the influence of Queer gender identity theories - its meaning has, sometimes contentiously, been expanded to describe a queer-identified person who is feminine in their presentation regardless of their gender or sexuality.
