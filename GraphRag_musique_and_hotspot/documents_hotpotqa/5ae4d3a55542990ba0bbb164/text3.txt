In American folklore, Chessie is a sea monster said to live in the midst of the Chesapeake Bay.
 Over the years there have been many alleged sightings of a serpent-like creature with flippers as part of its body.
 Most sighting reports describe it as a long, snake-like creature, from 25 ft to 40 ft long.
 It is said to swim using its body as a sine curve moving through the water.
 There were a rash of sightings in 1977 and more in the 1980s, with occasional reports since then.
