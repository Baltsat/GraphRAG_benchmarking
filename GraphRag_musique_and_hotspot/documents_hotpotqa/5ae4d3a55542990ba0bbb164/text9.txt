The Teakettler (Urocyon iugulebesonia) is a legendary creature from American folklore with origins in lumberjack culture, specifically the lumber camps of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
 It is part of a group of similar folklore creatures known collectively as Fearsome Critters.
 It is said to resemble a small stubby legged dog with the ears of a cat.
 Its name comes from the sound it makes, which is akin to that of a boiling tea kettle.
 It only walks backwards, and steam issues from its mouth as it makes its whistle.
 As the myth goes, only a few lumberjacks have seen one, as they are very shy, but if a boiling kettle is heard and nowhere to be found, it is sure that a Teakettler is nearby.
