Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a cryptid which supposedly is a simian-like creature of American folklore that is said to inhabit forests, especially in the Pacific Northwest.
 Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid.
 The term "sasquatch" is an Anglicized derivative of the Halkomelem word "s√°sq'ets".
