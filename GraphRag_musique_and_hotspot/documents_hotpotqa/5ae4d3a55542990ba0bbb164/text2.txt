The Hidebehind is a nocturnal fearsome critter from American folklore that preys upon humans that wander the woods, and was credited for the disappearances of early loggers when they failed to return to camp.
 As its name suggests, the Hidebehind is noted for its ability to conceal itself.
 When an observer attempts to look directly at it, the creature hides again behind an object or the observer and therefore can't be directly seen: a feat it accomplishes by sucking in its stomach to a point where it is so slender that it can easily cover itself behind the trunk of any tree.
 The Hidebehind uses this ability to stalk human prey without being observed and to attack without warning.
 Their victims, including lumberjacks who frequent the forests, are dragged back to the creature's lair to be devoured.
 The creature subsists chiefly upon the intestines of its victim, and has a severe aversion to alcohol, which is considered a sufficient repellent.
 Tales of the Hidebehind may have helped explain strange noises in the forest at night.
 Early accounts describe hidebehinds as large, powerful animals, despite the fact that no one was able to see them.
