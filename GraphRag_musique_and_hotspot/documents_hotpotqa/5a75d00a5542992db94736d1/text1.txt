The 1996 Currie Cup was the 58th season of the Currie Cup, South Africa's premier domestic rugby union competition, since it started in 1889.
 The competition was known as the Bankfin Currie Cup for sponsorship reasons and was contested from 30 May to 24 October 1996.
 This was also the first season since the advent of professionalism in South African rugby union, which led to a major restructuring in several facets of the sport.
 The number of provincial unions were reduced from 22 to 14, all of which participated in a single Currie Cup tournament.
