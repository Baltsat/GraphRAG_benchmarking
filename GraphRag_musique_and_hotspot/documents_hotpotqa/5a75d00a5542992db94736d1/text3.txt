Rhodesia ( ), commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe.
 With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a "de facto" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923).
