The 1991 Currie Cup (known as the "Bankfin Currie Cup" for sponsorship reasons) was the top division of the Currie Cup competition, the premier domestic rugby union competition in South Africa.
 This was the 53rd season since the competition started in 1889 and the first time it was known as the Bankfin Currie Cup, following the sponsors' name change from Santam Bank.
