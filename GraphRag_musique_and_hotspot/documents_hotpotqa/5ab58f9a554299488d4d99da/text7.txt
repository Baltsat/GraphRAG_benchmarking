Lady Augusta Gordon ("née" FitzClarence; 17 November 1803 – 8 December 1865) was a British noblewoman.
 Born the fourth illegitimate daughter of William IV of the United Kingdom (then Duke of Clarence) by his long-time mistress Dorothea Jordan, she grew up at their Bushy House residence in Teddington.
 Augusta had four sisters and five brothers all surnamed FitzClarence.
 Soon after their father became monarch, the FitzClarence children were raised to the ranks of younger children of a marquess.
