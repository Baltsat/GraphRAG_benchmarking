Edward "Ned" Hughes (26 April 1881 â€“ 1 May 1928), was a New Zealand rugby union and rugby league player who played 9 times (6 of these were test matches) as an All Black hooker from 1907 until 1921 and twice for the Kiwis in 1910.
 His All Black career is unique in that there was a gap of 13 years between test matches, and that he is the oldest player ever to have played for the All Blacks, at age 40 years, 123 days.
