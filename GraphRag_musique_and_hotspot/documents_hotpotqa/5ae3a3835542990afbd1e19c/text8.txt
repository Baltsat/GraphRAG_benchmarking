Dwayne Leik (born February 9, 1964) is a former NASCAR driver.
 He was formerly an owner of Leik Motorsports and a part-time driver in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.
 He formerly worked as the business manager for Marcis Racing and legendary NASCAR driver Dave Marcis.
 Leik was able to secure racing sponsorship for Marcis for eleven consecutive seasons and he is widely regarded as the key figure in resurrecting Marcisâ€™ faltering career.
 Since Marcis Racing did not have a test team, Leik's car was often seen as a test car for Marcis Racing.
 Leik also accompanied Marcis and participated in the IROC (International Race of Champions) test sessions.
 He once logged over 1,100 mi in an IROC car at Daytona in a single day test.
 He has also served as a driving instructor at the Fast Track High Performance Driving School and Richard Petty Driving School.
