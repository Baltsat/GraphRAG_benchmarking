 Pastrana 199 Racing (formerly Diamond Ridge Motorsports, Diamond-Waltrip Racing, and Pastrana-Waltrip Racing) is a NASCAR Nationwide Series team that competed in the NASCAR Cup Series and Busch Series from 1990 to 1999, and revived as a Nationwide Series team in 2010.
 The original Diamond Ridge team was owned and operated by Gary Bechtel.
 Despite modest success in the Busch Series, the team was never able to maintain a competitive level in the Winston Cup Series.
 The team was revived as a partnership with Michael Waltrip Racing in 2010 as Diamond-Waltrip Racing, running full-time in the Nationwide Series with Trevor Bayne.
 For 2011 the team partnered with action star Travis Pastrana and MWR development driver Ryan Truex, though the team shuttered temporarily due to Pastrana's injuries at the 2011 Summer X Games and a lacking sponsor.
 The team changed its name to Pastrana 199 Racing, a reference to Pastrana's standard number.
 The team was to field the No. 99 for Pastrana, but the deal was cancelled when Michael Waltrip Racing aligned with RAB Racing to field the No. 99.
