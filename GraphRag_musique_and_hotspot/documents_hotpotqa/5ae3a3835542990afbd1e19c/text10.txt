Carl Michael Edwards II (born August 15, 1979) is a retired American professional stock car racing driver.
 He competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driving the No. 19 Toyota Camry for Joe Gibbs Racing.
 Prior to that, he drove the No. 99 Ford Fusion for Roush Fenway Racing.
 He won the 2007 NASCAR Busch Series championship and nearly won the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series title, but lost by a tiebreaker to Tony Stewart.
 Edwards is well known for doing a backflip off of his car to celebrate a victory, which was a result of saving himself from a potential fall when he had his first win.
