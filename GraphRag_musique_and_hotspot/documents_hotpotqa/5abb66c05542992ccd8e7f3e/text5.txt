The 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal arose in February 2017 when the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) suspended cricketers under its anti-corruption code in an ongoing investigation backed by International Cricket Council (ICC)'s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit on spot-fixing during the 2017 Pakistan Super League.
 The six cricketers suspended by the PCB are: Sharjeel Khan (on 10 February), Khalid Latif (on 10 February), Nasir Jamshed (on 13 February), Mohammad Irfan (on 14 March), Shahzaib Hasan (on 17 March) and Mohammad Nawaz (16 May).
