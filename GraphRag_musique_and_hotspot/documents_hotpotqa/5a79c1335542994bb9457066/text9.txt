Kevin Patrick Shields (born 21 May 1963) is an American-born Irish musician, singer-songwriter, composer and producer, best known as the vocalist and guitarist of the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine.
 Shields performed in a number of small unsuccessful bands in Dublin, Ireland, as a teenager, before forming My Bloody Valentine with drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig in 1983.
 Although initially experiencing limited success, the band would later become extremely influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two original studio albums "Isn't Anything" (1988) and "Loveless" (1991), both of which pioneered a subgenre known as shoegazing.
 Shields' texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the "glide guitar" technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.
