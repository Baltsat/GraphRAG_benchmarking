Walter Frederick Morris (31 May 1892–1975) was an English novelist, best known for his mystery novel, "" (1929), set in World War I.
 Critic A.C. Ward praised this as "an adventure-mystery war-novel with an admirably ingenious and leak-proof plot.
 This book combines a brilliant exercise of creative imagination with a remarkable ability to reproduce, vividly, first-hand experiences, and there is one brief battle-scene…which is memorable.”
 ("The Nineteen-Twenties, Literature and Ideas in the Post-War Decade", 1930, pp 163–4).
 Spy novelist Eric Ambler named the book as one of his top five spy stories (in the Afterword to the 1952 edition of his "Epitaph for a Spy").
