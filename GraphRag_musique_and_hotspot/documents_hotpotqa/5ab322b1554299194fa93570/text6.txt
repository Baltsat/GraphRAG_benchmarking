Mary Poppins is a fictional character and the eponymous protagonist of P. L. Travers' "Mary Poppins" books and all of their adaptations.
 A magical English nanny, she blows in on the East Wind and arrives at the Banks home at Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane, London, where she is given charge of the Banks children and teaches them valuable lessons with a magical touch.
 Travers gives Poppins the accent and vocabulary of a real London nanny: cockney base notes overlaid with a strangled gentility.
