Edith the Fair (Old English: "Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce" , "Edyth the Gentle Swan"; c. 1025 – c. 1086), also known as Edith Swanneck, was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson.
 "Swanneck" (or Swan-Neck) comes from the folk etymology which made her in Old English as "swann hnecca", "swan neck", which was actually most likely a corrupted form of "swann hnesce, ""Gentle Swan"" ".
 She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was queen during Harold's reign.
