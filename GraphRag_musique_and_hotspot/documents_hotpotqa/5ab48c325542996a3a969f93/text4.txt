Fictional accounts based on the events surrounding Harold Godwinson's brief reign as king of England have been published, notably the play "Harold", by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in 1876; and the novel "Last of the Saxon Kings", by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in 1848.
 Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story, included in his 1910 collection, "Rewards and Fairies", where an aged King Harold meets Henry I and dies in the arms of a Saxon knight.
