 is a manufacturer of desktop and notebook personal computers.

 In 1988, Everex was the leader in tape backup sales with half of the world market.
 On January 5, 1993 the company filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Formosa Plastics Group, hence becoming part of a multinational conglomerate alongside companies like First International Computer, the world's leading motherboard manufacturer.
