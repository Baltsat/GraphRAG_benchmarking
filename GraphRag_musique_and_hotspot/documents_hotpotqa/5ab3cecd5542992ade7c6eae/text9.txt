This is a list of notable films that are primarily about and/or feature animals.
 While films involving dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are included on this list, those concerning mythical creatures, such as dragons or vampires, are not; however, films concerning anthropomorphized animals (such as Scooby-Doo), gigantized animals (such as King Kong), mutated forms of real animals (such as "Anaconda"), or fictional hybrids of real animals (such as "Sharktopus") are considered to be films about animals, and are thus featured on this list.
