Tufts University is a private research university incorporated in the municipality of Medford, Massachusetts, United States.
 Tufts College was founded in 1852 by Christian Universalists who worked for years to open a nonsectarian institution of higher learning.
 Charles Tufts donated the land for the campus on Walnut Hill, the highest point in Medford, saying that he wanted to set a "light on the hill".
 The name was changed to Tufts University in 1954, although the corporate name remains "the Trustees of Tufts College".
