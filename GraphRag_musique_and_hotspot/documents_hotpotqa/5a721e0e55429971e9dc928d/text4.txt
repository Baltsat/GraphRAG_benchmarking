The Tufts OpenCourseWare (OCW) project, is a web-based publication of educational material from a number of Tufts University courses, providing open sharing of free, searchable, high-quality course content to educators, students, and self-learners throughout the global community.
 The Tufts OCW initiative encourages the publication and free exchange of course materials on the World Wide Web.
 First launched in June 2005, Tufts OCW provides materials with strong representation from Tuftsâ€™ health sciences schools, some of which are equivalent to textbooks in depth.
 All materials on the Tufts OCW site are accessible at any time, free of charge.
 As Tufts OCW is not a distance learning program, no registration, applications, prerequisites, or fees are required and no credit is granted.
