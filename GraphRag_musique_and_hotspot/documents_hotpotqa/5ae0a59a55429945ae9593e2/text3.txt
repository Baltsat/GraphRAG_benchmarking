The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.
 The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.
 After the Roman conquest, their main "civitates", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, "the probable original capital") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, "whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced").
 Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae.
