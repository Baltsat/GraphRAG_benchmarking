The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.
 Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or "Cymru" in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while "Homo sapiens" arrived by about 31,000 BC.
 However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.
 During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.
 The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.
 The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.
 Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.
 The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century.
