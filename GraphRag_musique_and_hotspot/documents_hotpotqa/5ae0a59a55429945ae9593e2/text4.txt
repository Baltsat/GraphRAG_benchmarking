The Corieltauvi (formerly thought to be called the Coritani, and sometimes referred to as the Corieltavi) were a tribe of people living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a "civitas" of Roman Britain.
 Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands.
 They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east.
 Their capital was called "Ratae Corieltauvorum", known today as Leicester.
