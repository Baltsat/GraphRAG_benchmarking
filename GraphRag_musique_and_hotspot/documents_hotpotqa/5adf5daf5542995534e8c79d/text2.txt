Hilde Benjamin (née Lange, 5 February 1902 – 18 April 1989) was an East German judge and Minister of Justice.
 She is best known for presiding over a series of political show trials in the 1950s.
 She is particularly known as responsible for the politically motivated persecution of Erna Dorn and Ernst Jennrich.
 Hilde Benjamin was widely compared to the Nazi-era judge Roland Freisler and referred to as the "Red Freisler."
 In his 1994 inauguration speech German President Roman Herzog referenced Benjamin's status as a symbol of injustice, noting that her name was incompatible with the German constitution and the rule of law.
