Elaenia is the debut studio album by British electronic musician Sam Shepherd, released under his alias Floating Points on 6 November 2015 by Shepherd's own Pluto label and Luaka Bop.
 Shepherd created the artwork for the album by connecting fibre-optic cables to a home made harmonograph.
 Shepherd had originally conceived the album to contain only one track but was advised against the idea and eventually cut the music into seven songs.
 "Elaenia"'s title track was named when Shepherd experienced a dream about a bird that became engulfed in a forest after he had been reading the speculative fiction novel "" by American neuroscientist David Eagleman which had been given to him by a fan at a concert in San Francisco.
