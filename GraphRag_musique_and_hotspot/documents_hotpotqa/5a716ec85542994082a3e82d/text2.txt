The White Hell of Pitz Palu (German: "Die weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü" ) is a 1929 German silent mountain film co-directed by Arnold Fanck and Georg Wilhelm Pabst and starring Leni Riefenstahl, Gustav Diessl, Ernst Petersen, and World War I flying ace Ernst Udet.
 Written by Arnold Fanck and Ladislaus Vajda, the film is about a man who loses his wife in an avalanche while climbing the Piz Palü mountain, and spends the next few years searching the mountain alone for her body.
 Four years later he meets a young couple who agree to accompany him on his next climb.
 "The White Hell of Pitz Palu" was filmed on location in the Bernina Range in Graubünden, Switzerland.
 The 1929 theatrical release starred Kurt Gerron, who was Jewish, as a night club guest.
 The film was edited to remove scenes featuring Gerron, and it was rereleased as a 90-minute German-language sound film in 1935.
 It was remade in 1950.
