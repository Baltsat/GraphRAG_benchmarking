Rose Marie is a 1954 musical adaptation of the 1924 operetta of the same name, the third to be filmed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, following a 1928 silent movie and the best-known of the three, the 1936 Jeanette MacDonald/Nelson Eddy version.
 It is directed by Mervyn LeRoy and stars Ann Blyth, Howard Keel and Fernando Lamas.
 This version is filmed in the Canadian Rockies in CinemaScope.
 It was MGM's first US produced film in the new widescreen medium (having been preceded by the British made Knights of the Round Table) and the first movie musical of any studio to be released in this format.
