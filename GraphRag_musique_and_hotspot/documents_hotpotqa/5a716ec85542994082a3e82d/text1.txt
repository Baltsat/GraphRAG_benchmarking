K. Ravindran Nair was born in a rich family, dealing with cashew production and exports.
 His passion for literature and arts brought him into Malayalam cinema and in 1967, he established "General Pictures" under the banner of which he produced his first movie, Anweshichu Kandethiyilla, directed by P. Bhaskaran.
 This was followed by two more films the next year, Kattukurangu and Lakshaprabhu, both directed by Bhaskaran.
 Ravi, as he is generally known, was silent for the next few years till he came out with his next film, Achani, an A. Vincent movie, in 1973, which earned him the moniker, "Achani Ravi".
 The film was reported to be a commercial success like his earlier films and Ravi is known to have contributed the returns from the movie for building a Public Library in Kollam, of which he is a founder member and honorary secretary.
