Live from Daryl's House (simply known as Daryl's House, and often abbreviated as LFDH) is an online series that was first created in fall 2007.
 The show features singer-songwriter Daryl Hall performing with his band and various guest artists at his home in Millerton, New York.
 The show provides a performance space that is an alternative to live concerts and studio sessions for popular artists.
 This allows the artists to "â€¦have fun and [be] creatively spontaneous".
 The majority of shows include a segment in which Hall and the guest artist prepare food from different cuisines for everyone to eat.
 The food comes from various local restaurants and the chefs of those establishments walk Hall and guest through the preparation of the food.
 "Live From Daryl's House" expanded to broadcast TV but remained unchanged.
 Hall was quoted by Billboard.com as saying "it's an Internet show that is being shown on television, so I'm not adapting the show at all in any way to be a 'TV' show."
 The show debuted in 95 markets on September 24, 2011, with back-to-back half-hour episodes featuring Train (Episode 33) and Fitz & the Tantrums (Episode 35).
 Starting with the 66th episode of "Live From Daryl's House", the shows are filmed at Hall's club, Daryl's House, in Pawling, New York.
