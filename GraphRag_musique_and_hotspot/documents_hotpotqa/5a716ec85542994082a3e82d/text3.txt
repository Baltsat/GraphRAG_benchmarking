The Asturian Cinema (or "Asturian National Cinema") in Asturias, Spain, began in 1905 with the production of the first Asturian fiction film known as "El robo de fruta" (The fruit robbery).
 It was filmed by the Asturian film maker Javier S치nchez Manteola.
 This movie was filmed in Gij칩n (Asturias) and premiered in that city in the same year.
 It was shown in the old movie theater known as Sal칩n Luminoso once located at Bego침a Walk.
 In commemoration of this even the Asturian Film Festival was established in the year 2005.
