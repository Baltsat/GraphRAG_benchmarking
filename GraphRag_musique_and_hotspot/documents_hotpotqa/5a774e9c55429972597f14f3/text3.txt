Just as I Am is the debut album by gospel singer Yolanda Adams, released on September 22, 1987 on the Sound of Gospel label and produced by Thomas Whitfield, who also worked with singer Vanessa Bell Armstrong on early 1980s gospel releases.
 Though original pressings of the vinyl and cassette release are difficult to find, the album has since been re-released on CD along with another catalog album from Sound of Gospel by Wanda Nero Butler entitled "New Born Soul".
