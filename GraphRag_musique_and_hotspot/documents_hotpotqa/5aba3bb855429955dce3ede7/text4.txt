Allan Blaer (born 1942) is a physicist, Professor Emeritus and Special Lecturer at Columbia University in New York City.
 He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1964, where he was the valedictorian.
 He later went on to obtain his PhD in physics at the same institution.
 He has done research in both theoretical and experimental physics.
 In quantum field theory, he worked on phase transitions in low-temperature bosonic and fermionic systems, quantum field theory anomalies, dyons and magnetic monopoles in non-abelian gauge theories, and renormalization theory.
 In experimental physics, he has worked on a precision measurement of vacuum polarization in muonic atoms to test quantum electrodynamics.
