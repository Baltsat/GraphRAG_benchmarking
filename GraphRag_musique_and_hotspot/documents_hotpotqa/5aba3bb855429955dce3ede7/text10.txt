The Wu experiment was a nuclear physics experiment conducted in 1956 by the Chinese American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu in collaboration with the Low Temperature Group of the US National Bureau of Standards.
 The experiment's purpose was to establish whether or not conservation of parity ("P"-conservation), which was previously established in the electromagnetic and strong interactions, also applied to weak interactions.
 If "P"-conservation were true, a mirrored version of the world (where left is right and right is left) would behave as the mirror image of the current world.
 If "P"-conservation were violated, then it would be possible to distinguish between a mirrored version of the world and the mirror image of the current world.
