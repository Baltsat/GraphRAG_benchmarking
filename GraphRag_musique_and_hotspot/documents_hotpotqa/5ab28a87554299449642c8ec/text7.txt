"The Uninhabitable Earth" is a "New York" magazine article by American journalist David Wallace-Wells published on July 9, 2017.
 The long-form article depicts a pessimistic worst-case scenario of what might happen in the near-future due to global warming.
 The article starts with the statement "[i]f your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible."
 Robinson Meyer of "The Atlantic" said it is an "unusually specific and severe depiction of what global warming will do to the planet."
 Susan Matthews writing in "Slate" said "The instantly viral piece might be the "Silent Spring" of our time".
