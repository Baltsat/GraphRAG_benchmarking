The byline on a newspaper or magazine article gives the date, as well as the name of the writer of the article.
 Bylines are commonly placed between the headline and the text of the article, although some magazines (notably "Reader's Digest") place bylines at the bottom of the page to leave more room for graphical elements around the headline.
