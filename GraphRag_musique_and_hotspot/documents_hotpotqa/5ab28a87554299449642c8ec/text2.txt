"Is Google Making Us Stupid?
 What the Internet is doing to our brains" (alternatively "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?")
 is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition.
 It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of "The Atlantic" magazine as a six-page cover story.
 Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation.
 Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web.
 Carr expanded his argument in "", a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.
