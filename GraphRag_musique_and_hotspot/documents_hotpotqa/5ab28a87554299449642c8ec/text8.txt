The Simple Art of Murder is hard-boiled detective fiction author Raymond Chandler's critical essay, a magazine article, and his collection of short stories.
 The essay was first published in "The Atlantic Monthly" in December 1944.
 The magazine article appeared in the "Saturday Review of Literature", April 15, 1950.
 The article, somewhat rewritten, served to introduce the collection "The Simple Art of Murder", 1950 (Houghton Mifflin Co.), which contained eight of Chandler's early stories pre-dating his first novel, "The Big Sleep".
