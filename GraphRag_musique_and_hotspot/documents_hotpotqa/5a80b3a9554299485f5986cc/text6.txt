The Cobb Galleria Centre is a meeting and convention center and a shopping center in the Cumberland/Galleria district of Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States.
 It is also located next to a cluster of mid-rise office buildings, the Cumberland Mall and the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.
 It has hosted over 15,000 events and millions of guests.
 The venue operates under the direction of the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and is located at the intersection of three major highways: Interstate 75, Interstate 285, and Cobb Parkway (U.S. 41) just northwest of the city.
 The Galleria Specialty Mall, which pre-dates the convention center, is located downstairs, with meeting halls upstairs.
