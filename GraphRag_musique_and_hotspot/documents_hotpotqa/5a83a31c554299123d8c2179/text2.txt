"Heard 'Em Say" is a song by American hip-hop artist Kanye West.
 It was released on November 8, 2005 as the third single for his second studio album, "Late Registration".
 The song features Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine, who sings the chorus and bridge.
 West co-produced the track with Jon Brion, and it contains excerpts from "Someone That I Used to Love" as performed by Natalie Cole.
 The song was met by acclaim from contemporary music critics and is often seen as one of West's best.
 The refrain of "Heard 'Em Say" was later recycled for the Maroon 5 song "Nothing Lasts Forever" which appears on their 2007 album "It Won't Be Soon Before Long".
