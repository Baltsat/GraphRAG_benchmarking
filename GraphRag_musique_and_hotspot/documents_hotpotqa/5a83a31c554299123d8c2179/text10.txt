V (Roman numeral for five) is the fifth studio album by American band Maroon 5.
 It was released on August 29, 2014, by Interscope Records.
 "V" was Maroon 5's first album to be released through Interscope after the band's previous label, A&M Octone Records, transferred them along with most of its artists to Interscope.
 The album also saw the return of keyboardist/rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist Jesse Carmichael after his absence from recording, touring and promoting "Overexposed" (2012).
