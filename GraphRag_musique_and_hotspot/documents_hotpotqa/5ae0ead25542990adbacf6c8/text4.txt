A Jersey barrier or Jersey wall is a modular concrete or plastic barrier employed to separate lanes of traffic.
 It is designed to minimize vehicle damage in cases of incidental contact while still preventing the crossover case of a head-on collision.
 Jersey barriers are also used to reroute traffic and protect pedestrians and workers during highway construction, as well as temporary and semi-permanent protections against landborne attack such as suicide vehicle bombs.
 A Jersey barrier is also known in the western United States as K-rail, or K-wall, a term borrowed from the California Department of Transportation specification for temporary concrete traffic barriers, or colloquially as a Jersey bump.
 Plastic water-filled barriers of the same general shape are also now commonly called Jersey barriers.
