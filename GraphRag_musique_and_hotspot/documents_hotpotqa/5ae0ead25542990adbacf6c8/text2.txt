Fundamental articles was a term employed by early Protestant theologians, who wished to distinguish some essential parts of the Christian faith from non-essential doctrines.
 There were then a number of reasons for establishing such a distinction.
 Individual churches might accept or reject parts of doctrine, without forfeiting their claim to rank as parts of the universal Church.
 Therefore, theologians might find a dogmatic basis for union between separated churches.
 Also, the arguments of Catholics could be answered in a polemical way.
 To Protestants, the fundamental articles are those that Christians must believe to be saved.
