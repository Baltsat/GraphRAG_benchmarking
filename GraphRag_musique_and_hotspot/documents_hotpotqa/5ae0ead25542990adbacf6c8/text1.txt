Salty liquorice, also known as salmiak or salmiakki (in Finland), is a variety of liquorice flavoured with ammonium chloride, common in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and northern Germany.
 Ammonium chloride gives salty liquorice an astringent, salty taste (hence the name), which has been described as "tongue-numbing" and "almost-stinging".
 Salty liquorice is an acquired taste and people not familiar with ammonium chloride might find the taste physically overwhelming and unlikeable.
 Salty liquorice candies are almost always black or very dark brown and can range from very soft to very hard and may be brittle.
 The other colours used are white and variants of grey.
 Salty liquorice is also used as a flavouring in other products, such as ice creams and alcoholic beverages.
