Everyman is a British television documentary series that aired on BBC One in a late-night slot on Sunday evenings between 1977 and 2005.
 Its subject matter tended to be focused on moral and religious issues, often in the form of a film in which individuals would discuss their thoughts.
 One edition from 1990, "A Game of Soldiers" concerned a group of soldiers exploring their feelings about being trained to kill.
 Throughout much of its time on air, series of "Everyman" aired alternately with "Heart of the Matter", a debate series which featured somewhat similar topics.
 Both series were cancelled in the 2000s after the BBC revamped the output of its religious programming.
