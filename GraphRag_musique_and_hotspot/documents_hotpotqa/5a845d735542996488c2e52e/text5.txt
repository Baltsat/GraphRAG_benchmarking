A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election.
 The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to both candidates, such as by saying Joko Widodo and Jusuf Kalla, and Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, were running mates in relation to the most recent presidential elections held in Indonesia and Kenya respectively.
