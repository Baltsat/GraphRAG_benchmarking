In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College.
 Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in December.
 Electors today are elected in every state by popular vote, and in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate â€” that is, they are said to have been "pledged" to that candidate.
 In the 20th century, however, several elections were contested by unpledged electors, who made no pledge to any candidate before the election.
 These anomalies largely arose over fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation.
 No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.
