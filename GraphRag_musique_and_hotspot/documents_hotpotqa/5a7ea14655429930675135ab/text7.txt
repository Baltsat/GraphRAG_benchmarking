The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian group in the United States that was organized after a period of repeated business depressions during the 1890s.
 The society had its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California.
 Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930.
 Although it never numbered more than a handful of adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American utopian group.
