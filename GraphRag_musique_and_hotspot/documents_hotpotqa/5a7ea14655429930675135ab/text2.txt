The Oneida Community Mansion House is a historic house and museum that was once the home of the Oneida Community, a religiously-based socialist Utopian group led by John Humphrey Noyes.
 Noyes and his followers moved to the site in Oneida from Putney, Vermont in 1848.
 The Community lived in the Mansion House communally until 1880, when they dissolved into a joint-stock company.
