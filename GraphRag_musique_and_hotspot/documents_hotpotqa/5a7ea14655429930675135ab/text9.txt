The Qarmatians (Arabic: قرامطة‎ ‎ "Qarāmita"; also transliterated Carmathians, Qarmathians, Karmathians) were a syncretic religious group that combined elements of Zoroastrianism with the Ismaili Shia Islam centered in al-Hasa (Eastern Arabia), where they established a religious utopian republic in 899 CE.
 They are most famed for their revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate.
 Mecca was sacked by the sect’s leader, Abu Tahir al-Jannabi, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the Black Stone and desecration of the Zamzam Well with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE.
