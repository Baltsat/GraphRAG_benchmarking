The Margarodidae or ground pearls (cottony cushion scales, giant coccids, giant scale insects) are a family of scale insects within the superfamily Coccoidea.
 Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus "Porphyrophora") and the original ground pearl genus, "Margarodes".
 Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first.
 Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century.
 Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae.
 The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae "sensu stricto" or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.
