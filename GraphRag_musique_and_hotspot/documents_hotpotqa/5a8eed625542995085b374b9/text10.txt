The British North America Acts 1867â€“1975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada.
 They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.
 In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.
 The rest were renamed in Canada as the "Constitution Acts".
 In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.
 The term "British North America" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.
