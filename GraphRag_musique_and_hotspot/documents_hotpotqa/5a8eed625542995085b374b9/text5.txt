The Atlantis Music Prize is a music award annually given to the best full-length album from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, based only on artistic merit, regardless of genre, sales or record label.
 The award, established in 2008 by St. John's-based alternative newspaper "The Scope", includes a certificate prize of $1000.
 The award is modeled after the Polaris Music Prize for all of Canada (which in turn is modeled after the Mercury Music Prize in the United Kingdom).
