The General Assembly House, colloquially called Shedifice by the members of parliament, was the first house of the New Zealand Parliament in Auckland.
 It was in use by Parliament from 1854 until 1864 during the time that Auckland was the capital of New Zealand.
 It was also used by the Auckland Provincial Council, with Auckland Province owning the building from 1858.
 After the abolition of the provincial government system, the building was used by government's survey department and was then used by Auckland University College.
 The General Assembly House was demolished in 1917 to make way for Anzac Avenue.
 Today, a reserve adjacent to Parliament Street commemorates the location where New Zealand Parliament met initially.
