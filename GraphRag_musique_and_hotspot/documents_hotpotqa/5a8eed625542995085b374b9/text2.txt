The Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed.
 As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution.
 Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates.
 Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list.
 The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a "definitive list".
 However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada.
