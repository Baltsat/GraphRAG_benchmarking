The 2011–12 Minnesota Timberwolves season was the 23rd season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
 In their first season with head coach Rick Adelman, the team finished the lockout-shortened season with a 26–40 record, nine wins above their previous season and finished in 12th place in the Western Conference.
 This season saw the debut of 2009 draftee Ricky Rubio, who was a contender for the Rookie of the Year Award until he tore his ACL and his lateral collateral ligament after colliding into Kobe Bryant during a game against the Los Angeles Lakers and was out for the rest of the season.
 Following the season, Brad Miller retired.
