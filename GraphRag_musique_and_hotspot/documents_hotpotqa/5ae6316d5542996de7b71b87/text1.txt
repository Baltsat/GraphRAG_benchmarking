Emilio Sagi Liñán (born Bolívar, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 15 March 1900; died Barcelona, 25 May 1951), was a former Spanish footballer who played as a left-winger for FC Barcelona, the Catalan XI and Spain during the 1920s and 1930s.
 He was the son of Emilio Sagi Barba, the Catalan baritone singer, and Concepción Liñán Pelegrí, a dancer, and as a result, was widely referred to as Sagibarba (father's surnames together in a single surname).
 During his playing career he played 455 games and scored 134 goals for FC Barcelona and is best remembered for forming a successful partnership with Paulino Alcántara.
 Together with Josep Samitier, Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga and, later, Franz Platko they were prominent members of the successful FC Barcelona team coached by Jack Greenwell.
 His younger brother, Luís Sagi Vela, followed in his fathers footsteps and also became a successful baritone singer.
 His son, Victor Sagi, later ran one of the biggest advertising agencies in Spain and in 1978 announced his candidacy for the presidency of FC Barcelona, but withdrew before the election was held.
