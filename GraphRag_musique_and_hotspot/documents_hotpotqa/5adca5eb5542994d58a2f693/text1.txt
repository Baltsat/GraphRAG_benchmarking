Plymouth Argyle Football Club is an English association football club based in Plymouth, Devon.
 They compete in Football League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system, as of the 2012–13 season.
 The club was founded in 1886 as "Argyle Football Club".
 At this time, there was no League football, so matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions.
 In January 1903, the club became a limited company and changed their name to "Plymouth Argyle F.C." Election to the Southern League followed in March, as the club gained direct entry to the First Division for the 1903–04 season.
 The club were also invited to compete in the Western League, a competition which was considered secondary to the Southern League.
