Coopers Brewery Limited, the largest Australian-owned brewery, is based in the Adelaide suburb of Regency Park.
 Coopers is known for making a variety of beers, the most famous of which are its Pale Ale and Sparkling Ale.
 The brewery sold 69.7 million litres of beer in the 2013 financial year.
 It is also the world's largest producer of homebrewing equipment.
 Its shares are primarily owned by the extended Cooper family, and the company's constitution and classes of shares makes it difficult to sell shares outside the family.
