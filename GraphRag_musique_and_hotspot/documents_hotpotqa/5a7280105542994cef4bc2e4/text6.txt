The Lost Vikings is a puzzle-platform video game developed by Silicon & Synapse (now Blizzard Entertainment) and published by Interplay.
 It was originally released for the Super NES in 1992, then subsequently released for the Amiga, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, and Mega Drive/Genesis systems the next year; the Mega Drive/Genesis version contains five stages not present in any other version of the game.
 Blizzard re-released the game for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.
 In 2014, the game was added to Battle.net as a free download emulated through DOSBox.
