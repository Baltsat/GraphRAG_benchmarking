Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform video game developed by Polytron Corporation and published by Trapdoor.
 The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world to be one of four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world.
 The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles.
 The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.
