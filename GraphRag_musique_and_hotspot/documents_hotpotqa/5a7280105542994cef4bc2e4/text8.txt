Pitman, also known as Catrap in the US, is a puzzle-platform video game released by Asmik for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1990, originally developed for the Sharp MZ-700 computer in 1985.
 The Game Boy version of Pitman was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in October 2011.
 The word 'Catrap' refers to the frequent amount of times the player is trapped and needs to reverse their movements and the two anthropomorphic cats the player must manoeuvre to advance through the levels.
 The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic, which later appeared in titles like "", "", "Braid" and Pullblox.
