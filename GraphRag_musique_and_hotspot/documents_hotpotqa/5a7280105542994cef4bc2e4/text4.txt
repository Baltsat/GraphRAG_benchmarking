Portal 2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.
 It is the sequel to "Portal" (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
 The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam.
 "Portal 2" was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game.
 Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release "Portal 2" several hours early.
