Limbo is a puzzle-platform video game developed by independent studio Playdead.
 The game was released in July 2010 on Xbox Live Arcade, and has since been ported to several other systems, including the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows.
 "Limbo" is a 2D side-scroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character.
 The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister.
 The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution.
 Playdead called the style of play "trial and death", and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions.
