The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2007 season started off promisingly with the Dodgers holding the Western Division lead for most of the first half of the season.
 However, the team faded down the stretch and finished the season in fourth place.
 Two of the teams big free agent signings, pitchers Jason Schmidt and Randy Wolf were injured and missed most of the season.
 A promising development was the play of several rookies including James Loney and Matt Kemp and the further development of second year catcher Russell Martin, who was named to his first All-Star Game.
