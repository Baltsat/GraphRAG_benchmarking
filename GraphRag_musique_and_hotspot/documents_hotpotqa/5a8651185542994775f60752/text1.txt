Tenda dos Milagres is a 1977 Brazilian drama film directed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos, based on the novel of the same name by Jorge Amado.
 It stars Hugo Carvana, Sonia Dias and Severino Dada.
 The director satirizes and exposes racism in Brazilian society.
 The most notable example where this is done is in a flashback scene where Brazilians are shown listening with approving interest to Nazi race theories in the late 1930s.
 "Tenda dos Milagres" was shot in Salvador, Bahia.
