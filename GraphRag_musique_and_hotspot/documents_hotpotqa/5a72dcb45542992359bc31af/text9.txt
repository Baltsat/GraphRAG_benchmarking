The Rexist Party (French: "Parti Rexiste" ), or simply Rex, was a far-right Catholic, nationalist, authoritarian and corporatist political party active in Belgium from 1935 until 1945.
 The party was founded by a journalist, LÃ©on Degrelle, and, unlike other fascist parties in the Belgium of the time, advocated Belgian unitarism and royalism.
 Initially the party ran in both Flanders and Wallonia but never achieved much success outside Wallonia and Brussels.
 Its name was derived from the Roman Catholic journal and publishing company "Christus Rex" (Latin for Christ the King).
