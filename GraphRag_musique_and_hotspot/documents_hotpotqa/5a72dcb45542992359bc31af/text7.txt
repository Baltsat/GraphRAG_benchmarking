Graco (pronounced gray-co) is an American baby products company, owned and operated by Newell Brands, now based in Atlanta, Georgia.
 It was founded in 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Russell Gray and Robert Cone (hence the name) as Graco Metal Products, a company that fabricated machine and car parts.
 Rex Thomas (one of two engineers hired to come up with a sustainable product) watched his wife sitting on the porch, rocking their baby in a swing with a string tied to it, while she read a book.
 Rex went into work the next day and said “why don’t we make an automatic baby swing.”
 After 18 months of research and development, the Swyngnomatic - the world’s first wind-up, automatic baby swing—was born in 1955, designed by company engineer Dave Saint.
 In 1987 the company pioneered the invention of the Pack N' Play Portable Playard, the world’s first portable playard (designed by Nate Saint, Dave Saint’s son).
