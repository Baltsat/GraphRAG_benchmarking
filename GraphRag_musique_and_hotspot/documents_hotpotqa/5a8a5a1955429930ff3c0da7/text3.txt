A Date with the Smithereens is the fifth album by the New Jersey rock band The Smithereens, released in 1994.
 It is seen as a stylistic departure by the band, as "A Date" is mainly influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, while previous albums have leaned more towards straightforward pop rock.
 The title is meant to be ironic as nearly all songs on the album are hate-inspired.
