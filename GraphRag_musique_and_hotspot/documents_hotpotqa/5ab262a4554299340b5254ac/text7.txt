Edward Palmer Thompson (3 February 1924 â€“ 28 August 1993), usually cited as E. P. Thompson, was a British historian, writer, socialist and peace campaigner.
 He is probably best known today for his historical work on the British radical movements in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in particular "The Making of the English Working Class" (1963).
 He also published influential biographies of William Morris (1955) and (posthumously) William Blake (1993) and was a prolific journalist and essayist.
 He also published the novel "The Sykaos Papers" and a collection of poetry.
 His work is considered to have been among the most important contributions to labour history and social history in the latter twentieth-century, with a global impact, including on scholarship in Asia and Africa.
