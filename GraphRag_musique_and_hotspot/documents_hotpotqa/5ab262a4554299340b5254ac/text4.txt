"The Most Dangerous Game", also published as "The Hounds of Zaroff", is a short story by Richard Connell, first published in "Collier's" on January 19, 1924.
 The story features a big-game hunter from New York City who falls off a yacht and swims to an isolated island in the Caribbean, where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat.
 The story is inspired by the big-game hunting safaris in Africa and South America that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.
