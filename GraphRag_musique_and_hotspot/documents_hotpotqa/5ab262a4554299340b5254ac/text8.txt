LRRC (Luddite Rural Recording Cooperative) was an online music mail-order and CDR/vinyl-focused independent record label run by Indiana lo-fi musician Joseph O'Connell, best known for his band Elephant Micah.
 In addition to some of O'Connell's own work, the label released music by Elephant Micah collaborator Jason Henn.
 The LRRC online store also stocked a variety of what O'Connell called "Homemade Music from Kentuckiana and Abroad," including recordings by regional underground bands like Vollmar, Mt. Gigantic, and Bronze Float.
