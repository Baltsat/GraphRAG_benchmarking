Namibia Breweries Limited (NBL) is a Namibian brewery founded in 1920 when Carl List and Hermann Ohlthaver acquired four small breweries with financial difficulties.
 The breweries were merged under the name South West Breweries Limited (SWB).
 SWB changed its name to Namibia Breweries Limited when Namibia gained independence on March 21, 1990.
 Ohlthaver & List Group of Companies are still the majority shareholder.
