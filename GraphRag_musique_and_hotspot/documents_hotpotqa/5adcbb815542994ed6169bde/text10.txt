Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry.
 In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer.
 Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice.
