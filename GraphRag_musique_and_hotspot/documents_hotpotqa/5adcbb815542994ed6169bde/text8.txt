This is a list of notable microbreweries.
 A microbrewery is a brewery which produces a limited amount of beer.
 The qualifications to be classified as a microbrewery vary by country.
 The term "microbrewery" originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s to describe the new generation of small breweries which focused on producing traditional cask ale.
 The first successful example of this approach was Litchborough Brewery founded by Bill Urquhart in 1975 in the Northamptonshire village of the same name.
 Although originally "microbrewery" was used in relation to the size of breweries, it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility, adaptability, experimentation, and customer service.
 The term and trend spread to the United States in the 1980s, where it eventually was used as a designation of breweries that produce fewer than 15,000 U.S. beer barrels (1,800,000 liters) (475,000 U.S. gallons) annually.
