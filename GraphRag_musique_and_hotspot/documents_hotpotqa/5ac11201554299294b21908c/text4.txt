The Church of Scientology is a multinational network and hierarchy of numerous ostensibly independent but interconnected corporate entities and other organizations devoted to the practice, administration and dissemination of Scientology, a new religious movement.
 The Church of Scientology International (CSI) is officially the Church of Scientology's parent organization, and is responsible for guiding local Scientology churches.
 At a local level, every church is a separate corporate entity set up as a licensed franchise and has its own board of directors and executives.
 The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden, New Jersey by L. Ron Hubbard.
 Its international headquarters are located at the Gold Base, in an unincorporated area of Riverside County, California.
 The location at Gilman Hotsprings is private property and not accessible by the public.
 Scientology Missions International is under CSI and oversees Scientology missions, which are local Scientology organizations smaller than churches.
 The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) is the organization which owns all the copyrights of the estate of L. Ron Hubbard.
