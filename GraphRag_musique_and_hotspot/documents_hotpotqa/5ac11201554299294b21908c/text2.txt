Paulville, Texas, is an American cooperative organization as well as the site and planned community under its development in the salt flats of north Hudspeth County, intended to consist exclusively of Ron Paul supporters.
 The Paulville community idea was named after U.S. Congressman and 2012 presidential candidate Ron Paul, and the cooperative is modeled on his often libertarian ideas. "
The New York Times" says, "For now, the town is little more than an idea and a title deed," but considers it to be evidence that Paul's "campaign appears to be growing into something beyond a conventional protest campaign," also echoing the concept expressed by others that "the Ron Paul revolution has increasingly less to do with Ron Paul".
