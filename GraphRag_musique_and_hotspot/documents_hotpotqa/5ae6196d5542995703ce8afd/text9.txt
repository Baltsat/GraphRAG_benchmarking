Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova (Russian: Агриппина Яковлевна Ваганова ; 26 June 1879 – 5 November 1951) was a Russian ballet teacher who developed the Vaganova method – the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old "Imperial Ballet School" (today the "Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet") under the "Premier Maître de Ballet" Marius Petipa throughout the mid to late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s.
 It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus.
 Her "Fundamentals of the Classical Dance" (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique.
 Her technique is one of the most popular techniques today.
