Ballet Master (also "Balletmaster", "Ballet Mistress" [increasingly archaic English language use], "Premier Maître de ballet" or "Premier Maître de ballet en Chef") is the term used for an employee of a ballet company who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company.
 In modern times, ballet masters are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the dancers for both new and established ballets in the company's repertoire.
 The artistic director of a ballet company, whether a male or female, may also be called its ballet master.
 Historic use of gender marking in job titles in ballet (and live theatre) is being supplanted by gender-neutral language job titles regardless of an employee's gender identity or expression (e.g. "Ballet Master" in lieu of "Ballet Mistress", "Wig Master" as an alternative to "Wig Mistress").
