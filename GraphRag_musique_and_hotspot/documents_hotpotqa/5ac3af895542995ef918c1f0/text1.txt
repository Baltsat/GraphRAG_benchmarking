Simone Forti (born 1935), is an American Italian Postmodern artist, dancer, choreographer, and writer.
 Since the 1950's, Forti has exhibited, performed, and taught workshops all over the world, including performances at the Louvre in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
 Her innovations in Postmodern dance, including her seminal 1961 body of work, "Dance Constructions", along with her contribution to the early Fluxus movement, have influenced many notable artists, including dancer/artist Yvonne Rainer and the Judson Dance Theater in New York.
 Forti first apprenticed with Anna Halprin in the 1950s and has since worked alongside artists and composers Nam June Paik, Steve Paxton, La Monte Young, Trisha Brown, Charlemagne Palestine, Peter Van Riper, Dan Graham, Yoshi Wada, and Robert Morris, among many others.
 Forti's published books include "Handbook in Motion" (1974, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design), "Angel" (1978, self-published), and "Oh Tongue" (2003, Beyond Baroque Foundation, ed.
 Fred Dewey).
