The term Pan-African colours refers to two different sets of three colours: red, gold (not yellow), and green (inspired by the flag of Ethiopia), and red, black, and green.
 They are used in flags and other emblems of various countries and territories in Africa and the Americas to represent Pan-Africanist ideology.
 The Rastafarian movement and many Pan-African organisations also often employ the colours for their activities.
