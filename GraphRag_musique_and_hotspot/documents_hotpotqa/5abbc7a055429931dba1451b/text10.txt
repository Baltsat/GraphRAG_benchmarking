Requiem for my friend is a major and the first non-film musical work composed by Zbigniew Preisner.
 The composition was meant to honour the composer's late friend, the director Krzysztof Kieślowski, with whom he collaborated while working on a number of films, including the famous "Three Colours" trilogy.
 The album was released in 1998 although some parts of the work must have been ready upon Kieślowski's passing as Preisner asserted in an interview that "the Requiem had accompanied Krzysztof in his last journey".
