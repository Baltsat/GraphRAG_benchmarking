Blue is the colour between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
 Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green.
 Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.
 In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.
 Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.
 Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor.
