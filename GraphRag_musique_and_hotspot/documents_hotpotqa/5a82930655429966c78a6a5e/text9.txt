The 2010 UCF Knights football team represented the University of Central Florida in the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season.
 Their head coach was George O'Leary, who was in his seventh season with the team.
 For the first time in program history, the Knights were nationally ranked following a nationally televised rout of Houston on November 5.
 For the third time in six years, UCF won the Conference USA Eastern Division and later, became Conference USA champions for the second time in four seasons.
 As a result, the Knights appeared in the Liberty Bowl, in which they defeated Georgia 10â€“6, for the first bowl victory in program history.
 UCF finished the season ranked in both final national polls, 20th in the Coaches Poll, and 21st in the AP Poll.
