The 2015 UCF Knights football team represented the University of Central Florida in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.
 The Knights were members of the East Division of the American Athletic Conference (The American), and played their home games at Bright House Networks Stadium on UCF's main campus in Orlando, Florida.
 The Knights were led by head coach George O'Leary, who was in his 12th and final season with the team.
 After starting the season 0–6, O'Leary resigned as UCF's interim athletic director, a position he had held since June when Todd Stansbury left for the same position at Oregon State.
 Following UCF's 59–10 defeat by Houston on homecoming, dropping the Knights to an 0–8 record, O'Leary resigned as head football coach.
 Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett served as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
