Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!
 is a 2017 American documentary film directed by Morgan Spurlock.
 A sequel to the 2004 film "Super Size Me", it explores the ways in which the fast food industry has rebranded itself as healthier since his original film through the process of Spurlock working to open his own fast food restaurant, thus exposing some of the ways in which that rebranding is more perception than reality.
