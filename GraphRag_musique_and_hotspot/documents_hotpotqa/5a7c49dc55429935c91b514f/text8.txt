Politics in the San Francisco Bay Area is widely regarded as one of the most liberal in the country.
 According to the California Secretary of State, the Democratic Party holds a voter registration advantage in every congressional district, state senate district, state assembly district, State Board of Equalization districts, all nine counties, and all but three of the 101 incorporated municipalities in the Bay Area.
 The Republican Party holds a voter registration advantage in one state assembly subdistrict (the portion of California's 4th State Assembly district in Solano county) and three cities, Atherton, Hillsborough, and Danville.
