iTV was a television station in Thailand owned by ITV Public Company Limited, a unit of Shin Corporation.
 Thailand's first UHF channel, the station was started in 1995 when the company was granted a 30-year concession by the Office of the Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office to operate a free-to-air television station in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrum at 510-790 MHz (from Channel 26 to 60).
 After a lengthy dispute over unpaid concession fees to the Prime Minister's Office, iTV was taken in 2007 over by the government's Public Relations Department and its name was changed to Thai Independent Television (TITV).
 Following a previously unannounced order of Thailand's Public Relations Department delivered the same day, the station closed down operations at the crack of dawn on January 15th, 2008.
 In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act, the channel's frequency was assigned to the Thai Public Broadcasting Service, or Thai PBS.
