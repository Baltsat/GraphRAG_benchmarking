Gerobatrachus is an extinct genus of amphibamid temnospondyl (represented by the type species Gerobatrachus hottoni) that lived in the Early Permian, approximately 290 million years ago (Ma), in the area that is now Baylor County, Texas.
 When it was first described in 2008, "Gerobatrachus" was announced to be the closest relative of Batrachia, the group that includes modern frogs and salamanders.
 It possesses a mixture of characteristics from both groups, including a large frog-like head and a salamander-like tail.
 These features have led to it being dubbed a frogamander by the press.
 Some more recent studies place "Gerobatrachus" as the closest relative of Lissamphibia, the group that contains all modern amphibians including frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, or place modern amphibians far from "Gerobatrachus" within a group called Lepospondyli.
