The Mascarene teal ("Anas theodori"), also known as Sauzier's teal and Mauritian duck, is an extinct dabbling duck that formerly occurred on the islands of Mauritius and Réunion.
 It was a small teal of the "Anas gibberifrons" superspecies of the "Anas" subgenus "Nettion".
 Its closest relative is probably Bernier's teal from Madagascar and, apart from having stronger wings and being considerably bigger (between a Sunda teal and a mallard in size), it seems to have looked very similar to that species.
 Earlier, it was proposed that Meller's duck, also from Madagascar, is the closest living relative of "A. theodori", but as more remains of the latter were unearthed this appears far less likely.
 Apart from a few, brief descriptions, not much is known about the bird in life, but its habits probably did not differ significantly from those of its close relatives.
 Bones have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius and more recently on Réunion also.
 The scientific name honours Thé́odore Sauzier, who made many bones of extinct birds found on Mauritius available to science.
