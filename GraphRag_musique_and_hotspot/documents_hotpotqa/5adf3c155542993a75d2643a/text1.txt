The Mazengarb Report of 1954, formally titled the "Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents", resulted from a ministerial inquiry (the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents) sparked primarily by two infamous and well-publicised events in New Zealand's history: the 22 June 1954 Parkerâ€“Hulme murder case (subject of the 1994 Peter Jackson film "Heavenly Creatures") and the 20 June 1954 "Petone incident".
 The report gained its name from the inquiry chairman, Queen's Counsel Ossie Mazengarb.
