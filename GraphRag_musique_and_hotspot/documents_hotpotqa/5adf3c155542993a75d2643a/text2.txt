India is a popular feminine given name derived from the name of the country India, which takes its name from the Indus River.
 The name was used for India Wilkes, a character in the novel and movie "Gone with the Wind".
 Its use for girls in England began during the British rule in India during the 19th century.
 It has been used for daughters of aristocratic families in England that had ties to Colonial India, such as India Hicks.
 Just like names derived from seasons like Summer, Dawn, Solstice, Autumn are feminine, India is internationally recognized as a female name since it's a name of a country and it had been used as a feminine given name for more than hundred years in England and the U.S. Although India is a popular feminine given name, it's not as popular a given name in India as it is around the world.
 Girls who are given this name are usually called with a nickname "indy", or "Indie" which are also popular given names for girls in English speaking countries.
