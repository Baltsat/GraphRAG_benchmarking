"Lisa the Drama Queen" is the ninth episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons".
 It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 25, 2009 and guest starred Emily Blunt as Juliet.
 A special version of the end credits theme was performed by Fall Out Boy, although they do not guest star in the actual episode.
 This was the last episode in the series to be presented only in standard definition, the first regular episode to begin right after the opening credits without a commercial break, with an episode now having four segments, and the last episode to use the original opening sequence starting from Season 2.
 Brian Kelley returns as a writer after five seasons of being absent from the show.
 The episode is very loosely based on the 1994 film "Heavenly Creatures".
