Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre (Norwegian: "Magnus Barfot kinosenter") is a cinema multiplex with 5 screens owned by Bergen Cinema.
 It is named after the street that runs along the building (however, it is not the address of the complex), which in turned is named after the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot.
 It is the main venue of Bergen International Film Festival.
