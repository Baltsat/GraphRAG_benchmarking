Radama I "the Great" (1793â€“1828) was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized as King of Madagascar (1810-1828) by a European state.
 He came to power at the age of 18 following the death of his father, King Andrianampoinimerina.
 Under Radama's rule and at his invitation, the first Europeans entered his central highland Kingdom of Imerina and its capital at Antananarivo.
 Radama encouraged these London Missionary Society envoys to establish schools to teach tradecraft and literacy to nobles and potential military and civil service recruits; they also introduced Christianity and taught literacy using the translated Bible.
 A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the Merina monarchy.
 Through aggressive military campaigns he successfully united two-thirds of the island under his rule.
 Abuse of alcohol weakened his health and he died prematurely at age 35.
 He was succeeded by his highest-ranking wife, Ranavalona I.
