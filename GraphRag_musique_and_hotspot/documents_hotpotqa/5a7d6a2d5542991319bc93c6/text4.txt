King Magnus' Halt, sometimes referred to as Magnus' Grave, is the terminal railway station on the Downpatrick & County Down Railway's Southern Line, located in the town of Downpatrick in County Down, Northern Ireland.
 It takes its name from the nearby grave of Viking King Magnus Barefoot.
 The grave is a Downpatrick tourist attraction that was not easily accessible prior to the arrival of the railway.
 It features a platform with lampposts on the East side of the line, which looks onto a field containing the barrow of King Magnus and a runestone which was placed in March 2003 to mark the 900th anniversary of his death.
