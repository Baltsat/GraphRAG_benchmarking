Magnus Olafsson (Old Norse: "Magnús Óláfsson", Norwegian: "Magnus Olavsson"; 1073 – 24 August 1103), better known as Magnus Barefoot (Old Norse: "Magnús berfœttr", Norwegian: "Magnus Berrføtt"), was King of Norway (as Magnus III) from 1093 until his death in 1103.
 His reign was marked by aggressive military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles and Ireland, where he extended his rule to the Kingdom of the Isles and Dublin.
