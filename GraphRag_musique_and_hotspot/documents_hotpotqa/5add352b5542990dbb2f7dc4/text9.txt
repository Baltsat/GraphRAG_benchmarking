The first HERC was established in Northern California in 2000 with Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of California at Santa Cruz as lead members, with the goal of allowing colleges and universities to collaborate on the recruitment of faculty, staff, and executives.
 There are currently eleven regional HERCs in the United States, consisting of over 550 campuses in 22 states and the District of Columbia.
