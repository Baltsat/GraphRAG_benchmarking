The Rat Pack is a term used by the media to refer to an informal group of entertainers centered on the Las Vegas casino scene.
 Having its origins in a group of friends that met at the Los Angeles home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, by the 1960s, it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group that called itself "the Summit" or "the Clan", featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop among others; they appeared together on stage and in films in the early 1960s, including the movies "Ocean's 11", "Sergeants 3", and "Robin and the 7 Hoods" (in the last film, Bing Crosby replaced Lawford).
 Sinatra, Martin, and Davis were regarded as the group's lead members.
