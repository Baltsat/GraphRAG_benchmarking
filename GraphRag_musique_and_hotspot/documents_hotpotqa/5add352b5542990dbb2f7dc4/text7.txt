Ocean's Thirteen is a 2007 American comedy heist film directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring an ensemble cast.
 It is the third and final film in the Soderbergh-directed "Ocean's Trilogy", following the 2004 sequel "Ocean's Twelve" and the 2001 film "Ocean's Eleven", which itself was a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film "Ocean's 11".
 All the male cast members reprise their roles from the previous installments, but neither Julia Roberts nor Catherine Zeta-Jones returns.
