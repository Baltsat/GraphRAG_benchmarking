A Very Merry Christmas is Bobby Vinton's ninth studio album and first Christmas album, released in October 1964.
 Vinton had released a four-track Christmas EP which entered the charts the previous year, containing none of the tracks included on "A Very Merry Christmas".
 Due to Billboard editorial policy, it was held off the regular Billboard LP listings.
 It reached #13 on a Christmas version of the Billboard Hot 200 list of popular albums.
 The CD, not currently in print, is a valuable collectors' item.
 Some of the tracks are available on the in-print disc "Kissin' Christmas".
