'"Merry Christmas from the Family" is a holiday song written by alternative country artist Robert Earl Keen.
 It has become extremely popular among the fans within his cult following.
 The song was first recorded for Keen's 1994 album, "Gringo Honeymoon".
 A live version also appears on his 1996, "No. 2 Live Dinner".
 The popularity of the song led Keen to write a sequel song, "Happy Holidays Y'all", for his 1998 album "Walking Distance", and to publish a book, "Merry Christmas from the Family", in 2001.
 The original song, the book, and the sequel all center around the same cast of characters in Keen's humorous vision of a Texas style Christmas.
