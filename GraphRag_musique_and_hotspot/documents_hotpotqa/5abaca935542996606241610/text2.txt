The Classic Christmas Album is a Christmas compilation album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on October 7, 2014, by Columbia Records and includes two 1961 recordings that were previously unavailable: "Ol' Kris Kringle" and the original version of the title track from his 1969 Christmas album "Give Me Your Love for Christmas".
 Three other songs ("Christmas in the City of the Angels", "Sign of the Dove" and "The Very First Christmas Day") make their debut on compact disc as of this release, and two other non-album singles ("Christmas Is..." and "My Kind of Christmas") can be counted among the rarities here.
 The collection also includes a selection or two from several of Mathis's Christmas studio albums—"Sleigh Ride" from "Merry Christmas", "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" from "Sounds of Christmas", "Calypso Noel" from "Give Me Your Love for Christmas", "The Christmas Waltz" and "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas" from "Christmas Eve with Johnny Mathis", and "Home for the Holidays" from "Sending You a Little Christmas"—as well as his duet with Bette Midler from her 2006 holiday album "Cool Yule", which was a medley of "Winter Wonderland" and "Let It Snow!
