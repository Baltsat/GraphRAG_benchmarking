WXJZ (100.9 FM) is a commercial radio station in Gainesville, Florida, broadcasting to the Gainesville-Ocala, Florida area on 100.9 FM.
 The station is owned by JVC Media, LLC, through licensee JVC Media of Florida, LLC, and broadcasts a classic hits format billed as "100.9 WOW FM".
 It started on 104.9 MHz before moving to the frequency of the former WYGC "Gator Country 100.9".
 Simultaneously, WYGC moved to WXJZ's 104.9 frequency.
 On December 26, 2013, sister station WBXY's Dance format moved over to the 100.9 signal, while JVC simulcasted the 99.5 signal until it was spun off to another company in January 2014.
 On September 12, 2015, at Midnight, after stunting throughout the 11th with patriotic music and country songs in a tribute to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, JVC flipped the station to Soft AC and bought the "Smooth 100.9" brand back to the market.
