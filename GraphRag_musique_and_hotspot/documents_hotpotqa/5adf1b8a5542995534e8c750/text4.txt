WWGR, commonly called Gator Country 101.9 Music, is a country music radio station based in the Fort Myers, FL area.
 The station, which is owned by Renda Broadcasting, operates at 101.9 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW.
 This power gives it one of the best radio signals in all of Southwest Florida.
 Its transmitter is located off Corkscrew Road in Estero.
 This incredible signal also has its disadvantages, having exceptional interference with 101.9 "AMP Radio" WQMP, an CHR/Top 40 licensed to Daytona Beach, but serves Orlando.
 The Sebring, Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Avon Park areas are the most affected by this interference with powerful radios receiving those two stations almost as one.
