The 2015 Wisconsin Badgers football team represented the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.
 The Badgers, led by first-year head coach Paul Chryst, were members of the West Division of the Big Ten Conference and played their home games at Camp Randall Stadium.
 On January 13, 2015, the Badgers hired offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph.
 The Badgers were the media preseason favorites to win the Big Ten West division.
 During fall camp prior to the start of the season Chryst announced the Badgers would return to a pro-style punt scheme instead of the shield punt scheme, also known as the spread punt scheme.
 Two days after Wisconsin played in the Holiday Bowl defensive coordinator Dave Aranda was hired by LSU as their new defensive coordinator.
 At the end of the season, Wisconsin featured the #1 defense in college football, with opponents averaging just 13.1 points per game against the Badgers.
