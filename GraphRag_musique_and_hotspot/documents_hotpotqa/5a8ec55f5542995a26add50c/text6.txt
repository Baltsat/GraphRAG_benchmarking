State Route 564, also known as SR 564, is a state highway in northern Arizona serving Navajo National Monument.
 This highway travels from U.S. Route 160 to Betatakin Ruin; SR 564 derives its number from the former route number of the adjacent stretch of US 160, U.S. Route 164.
 SR 564 ends at Betatakin; smaller roads travel beyond to Keet Seel.
