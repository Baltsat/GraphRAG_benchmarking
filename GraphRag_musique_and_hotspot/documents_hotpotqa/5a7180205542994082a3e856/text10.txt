Zoo Parade is an American television program broadcast from 1950 to 1957 that featured animals from the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.
 The program's host was Marlin Perkins, the Zoo's director.
 Perkins went on to host the program "Wild Kingdom".
 Jim Wehmeyer has described the show: "A precursor of sorts to the regularly featured animal segments on "The Tonight Show" and other late-night talk shows, "Zoo Parade" was a location-bound production (filmed in the reptile house basement) during which Perkins would present and describe the life and peculiarities of Lincoln Park Zoo animals."
