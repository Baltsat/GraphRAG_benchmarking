Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations.
 The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film.
 The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog.
 Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead.
 Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language.
