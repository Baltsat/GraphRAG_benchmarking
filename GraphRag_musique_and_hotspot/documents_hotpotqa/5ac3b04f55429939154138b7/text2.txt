Heywood railway station is a disused station on the Portland railway line in the town of Heywood, in the state of Victoria, Australia.
 The last passenger train between Ararat and Portland was on 12 September 1981, operated by a DRC railcar.
 The platform and station building are still in place at Heywood, although in a disused condition.
 Some of the former yard remains as unconnected broad gauge track, with power connections also provided to a work camp area.
 The former goods shed was removed by October 1983, and the through line was converted to standard gauge in 1995.
