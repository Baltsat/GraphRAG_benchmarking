The Wise Woman of Hoxton is a city comedy by the early modern English playwright Thomas Heywood.
 It was published under the title "The Wise-Woman of Hogsdon" in 1638, though it was probably first performed c. 1604 by the Queen's Men company (of which Heywood was a shareholder), either at The Curtain or perhaps The Red Bull.
 The play is set in Hoxton, an area that at the time was outside the boundaries of the city of London and notorious for its entertainments and recreations.
 The Victorian critic F. G. Fleay suggested that Heywood, who was also an actor, originally played the part of Sencer.
 It has often been compared with Ben Jonson's comic masterpiece "The Alchemist" (1610)â€”the poet T. S. Eliot, for example, argued that with this play Heywood "succeeds with something not too far below Jonson to be comparable to that master's work".
