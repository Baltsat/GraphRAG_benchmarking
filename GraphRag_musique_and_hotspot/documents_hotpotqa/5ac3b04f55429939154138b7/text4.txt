Swanage railway station is a railway station located in Swanage, on the Isle of Purbeck in the English county of Dorset.
 Originally the terminus of a London and South Western Railway (L&SWR) branch line from Wareham, the line and station were closed by British Rail in 1972.
 It has since reopened as a station on the Swanage Railway, a heritage railway that currently runs from Norden station just north of Corfe Castle to Swanage station.
 It now also runs to Wareham on certain services, but not on regular services due to signalling problems.
