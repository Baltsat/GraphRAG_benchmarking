The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.
 In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas.
 This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas.
 Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act.
