The Missouri Compromise is the title generally attached to the legislation passed by the 16th United States Congress on May 8, 1820.
 The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South.
 As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited North of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri.
 President James Monroe signed the legislation on April 6, 1820.
