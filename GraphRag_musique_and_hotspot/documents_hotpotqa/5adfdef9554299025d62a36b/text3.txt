The Republican Party, also commonly called the GOP (for "Grand Old Party"), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties.
 It is the second oldest existing political party in the United States after its primary rival, the Democratic Party.
 It emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act, an act that dissolved the terms of the Missouri Compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty.
 The Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States, but by 1858 in the North it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state.
