The Anti-Nebraska movement was a political alignment in the United States formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and to its repeal of the Missouri Compromise provision forbidding slavery in U.S. territories north of latitude 36Â° 30' N.
 (At the time, the name "Nebraska" could loosely refer to areas west of the Missouri River.)
