The Compromise of 1790 was a compromise between Alexander Hamilton on the one hand and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison whereby Hamilton won the decision for the national government to take over and pay the state debts, while Jefferson and Madison obtained the national capital (District of Columbia) for the South.
 The compromise resolved the deadlock in Congress.
 Southerners were blocking the assumption of state debts by the treasury, thereby destroying the Hamiltonian program for building a fiscally strong nation state.
 Northerners rejected the proposal, much desired by Virginians, to locate the permanent national capital on the Virginia-Maryland border.
 The compromise made possible the passage of the Residence and Funding (Assumption) Acts in July and August 1790.
 Historian Jacob Cooke says it is, "generally regarded as one of the most important bargains in American history, ranking just below the better known Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850."
