The parallel 36°30′ north is a circle of latitude that is 36 and one-half degrees north of the equator of the Earth.
 This parallel of latitude is particularly significant in the history of the United States as the line of the Missouri Compromise, which was used to divide the prospective slave and free states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of Missouri, which is mostly north of this parallel.
