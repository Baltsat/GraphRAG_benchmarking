Rosemary's Baby is a 2014 two-part, four-hour television miniseries adaptation of Ira Levin's best-selling horror novel of the same name.
 Zoe Saldana stars in the NBC production that is directed by Agnieszka Holland.
 Unlike earlier versions, it is set in Paris rather than New York.
 The work was not well received by critics, many of whom said that it was stretched to fill two two-hour timeslots.
 Although there are several notable changes, this miniseries is considered to be a fairly true updating of the original film adaptation.
