Valentino's is a regional Italian restaurant chain based in Lincoln, Nebraska.
 Valentino's was founded by Val and Zena Weiler in 1957.
 The restaurant was purchased by two Lincoln families in 1971 and began franchising additional locations.
 The first carry-out store opened in 1990, and many of the full-scale restaurants converted to the buffet concept in the early-2000s.
