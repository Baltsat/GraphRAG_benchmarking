The University of North Texas Discovery Park Campus, formerly Research Park, is a satellite research facility of the University of North Texas.
 Discovery Park is located in Denton, Texas, north of the main campus, on U.S. Highway 77.
 In January 2004, the 550000 sqft facility, formerly occupied by Texas Instruments, opened to students from the UNT College of Engineering.
 In 2008, the newly formed College of Information joined the Discovery Park campus.
 The facility houses offices and labs for the Departments of Engineering Technology, Computer Science and Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical and Energy Engineering, Library and Information Science and Learning Technologies.
 The Center for Technology Development and Transfer (CTDT) began operations from Discovery Park in 2006.
