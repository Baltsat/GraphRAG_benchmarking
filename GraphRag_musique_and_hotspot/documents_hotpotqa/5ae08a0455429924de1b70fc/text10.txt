The Borghild Project was a hoax purported to be evidence for a German project during World War II aimed at combating the spread of syphilis among Nazi troops by supplying soldiers with sex dolls.
 Adolf Hitler supposedly approved the project to distribute inflatable sex dolls to his soldiers, which could be transported in their backpacks in order to give them an option to avoid places of prostitution in Paris.
 After years of being considered a real project, the lack of evidence supporting its existence led to it being deemed a hoax in the early 2000s, for various reasons.
