 Released as the album's lead single on April 12, 2011, the song was written by Game and Lil Wayne, and it was produced by Miami-based production duo Cool & Dre, noted for producing three of Game's singles including the 2005 smash hit single "Hate It or Love It" which featured vocals from former fellow G-Unit member rapper 50 Cent.
 The single also marks the second collaboration between Game and Lil Wayne, their first collaboration being on Game's 2008 international hit single "My Life" from his third studio album "LAX" (2008), which featured vocals from Lil Wayne during the song's chorus.
 The song features a music sample of the nightclub hit "Kernkraft 400" (2000) (German for "Nuclear Energy 400") performed by German techno and electro band Zombie Nation from their debut album "Leichenschmaus" (1999).
