The First Battle of Eora Creek – Templeton's Crossing was fought from 31 August 1942 to 5 September 1942.
 Forming part of the Kokoda Track campaign of the Second World War, the battle involved military forces from Australia, supported by the United States, fighting against Japanese troops from Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment who had landed in Papua in mid-1942, with the intent of capturing Port Moresby.
 The battle was one of three defensive actions fought by the Australians along the Kokoda Track.
 The fighting resulted in the delay of the Japanese advance south, which allowed the Australians to withdraw to Efogi.
 Eora Creek village and Templeton's Crossing was subsequently the site of a battle in late October 1942 as the Australian forces pursued the Japanese forces retiring back toward the north coast of Papua.
