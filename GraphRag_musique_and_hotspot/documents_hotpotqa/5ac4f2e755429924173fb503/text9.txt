Zhongzheng or Chungcheng () is a common name for places, roads, schools or organizations in Chinese-speaking areas, though today predominantly in Taiwan.
 The majority of these places and things are named after Chiang Chung-cheng, the preferred given name of Chiang Kai-shek.
 As a result, when translating into English or other non-Chinese languages, it sometimes would be replaced by "Chiang Kai-shek" instead of simply by transliteration.
