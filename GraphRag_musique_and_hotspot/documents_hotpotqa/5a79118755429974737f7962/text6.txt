Sunny Day Real Estate was an American emo band from Seattle, Washington.
 They were one of the early emo bands and helped establish the genre.
 In 1994, the band released their debut album "Diary" on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim.
 However, shortly after releasing their second album "LP2", the band broke up, with members Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith joining Foo Fighters and Jeremy Enigk embarking on a solo career.
 In 1997, they regrouped long enough to record two more studio albums and a live album but ultimately disbanded once again in 2001.
 The band reunited again in 2009.
 Bassist Nate Mendel, who chose to remain with Foo Fighters during the previous reunion in 1997, took part in this reunion.
 In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel said Sunny Day Real Estate was inactive.
 According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a full-length album after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions "just fell apart".
 In 2014 the band released one song from those sessions, "Lipton Witch," on a split 7" vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day.
