Foo Fighters is an American alternative rock band formed by multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Dave Grohl in 1994.
 After recording the album "Foo Fighters" alone, Grohl enlisted guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith to join the band.
 This lineup recorded the second Foo Fighters album, 1997's "The Colour and the Shape", although most of Goldsmith's drum recordings were removed and re-recorded by Grohl for the release, after he left the band due to creative tensions.
 Goldsmith was replaced by Taylor Hawkins, and Franz Stahl replaced Smear after he also departed, although he only remained in the band for a short period and did not record an album with the group.
 The group's third album, "There Is Nothing Left to Lose", featured Hawkins on drums and was released in 1999.
