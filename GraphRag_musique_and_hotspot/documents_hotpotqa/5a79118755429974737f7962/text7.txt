The Fire Theft was an American rock band from Seattle, Washington.
 They were formed in 2001 by vocalist/guitarist Jeremy Enigk, bassist Nate Mendel, and drummer William Goldsmith, all of whom were previously members of Sunny Day Real Estate.
 Mendel also plays bass for Foo Fighters, and Goldsmith drummed for Foo Fighters between 1995 and 1997.
 This lineup was identical to the original line up of Sunny Day Real Estate but with the exception of guitarist Dan Hoerner.
 While the band went on a hiatus in 2004, there was never an announcement of an official breakup.
