City Center at White Plains is a large mixed-use development shopping complex in downtown White Plains, New York.
 It features two 35-story apartment and condominium towers, 600000 sqft of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities.
 City Center's opening in 2003 marked the beginning of a new downtown development renaissance, and with the improving economy and healthy office leasing activity, White Plains entered the new millennium as the leading retail and office center in Westchester County.
 The City Center has also become a known spot where members of the New York Knicks hang out during their time off since their practice facility is in Greenburgh, New York, which is just 14 minutes away.
