Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships (BDPs) were established as part of a $350 million gift by Michael Bloomberg, JHU Class of 1964, to Johns Hopkins University in 2013.
 Fifty faculty members, ten from Johns Hopkins University and forty recruited from institutions worldwide, will be chosen for these endowed professorships based on their research, teaching, service, and leadership records.
 The program is directed and managed by Johns Hopkins University Vice Provost for Research, Dr. Denis Wirtz.
