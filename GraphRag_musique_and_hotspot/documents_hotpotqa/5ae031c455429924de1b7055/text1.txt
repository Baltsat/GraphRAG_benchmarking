Northanger Abbey is a 2007 British television film adaptation of Jane Austen's eponymous novel.
 It was directed by British television director Jon Jones and the screenplay was written by Andrew Davies.
 Felicity Jones stars as the protagonist Catherine Morland and JJ Feild plays her love interest Henry Tilney.
 The story unfolds as the teenaged Catherine is invited to Bath to accompany some family friends.
 There she finds herself the object of Henry Tilney's and John Thorpe's (William Beck) affections.
 When she is asked to stay at Northanger Abbey, Catherine's youthful and naive imagination takes hold and she begins to confuse real life with the Gothic romance of her favorite novels.
