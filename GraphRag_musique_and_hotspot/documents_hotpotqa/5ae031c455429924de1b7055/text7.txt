He Knew He Was Right is an 1869 novel written by Anthony Trollope which describes the failure of a marriage caused by the unreasonable jealousy of a husband exacerbated by the stubbornness of a wilful wife.
 As is common with Trollope's works, there are also several substantial subplots.
 Trollope makes constant allusions to Shakespeare's "Othello" throughout the novel.
 Trollope considered this work to be a failure; he viewed the main character as unsympathetic, and the secondary characters and plots as much more lively and interesting, but it is one of his best known novels.
 It was adapted for BBC One in 2004 by Andrew Davies as "He Knew He Was Right".
