Sense and Sensibility is a 2008 British television drama adaptation of Jane Austen's 1811 novel "Sense and Sensibility".
 The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies, who revealed that the aim of the series was to make viewers forget Ang Lee's 1995 film "Sense and Sensibility".
 The series was "more overtly sexual" than previous Austen adaptations, and Davies included scenes featuring a seduction and a duel that were absent from the feature film.
 "Sense and Sensibility" was directed by John Alexander and produced by Anne Pivcevic.
 Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield star as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who go on "a voyage of burgeoning sexual and romantic discovery".
