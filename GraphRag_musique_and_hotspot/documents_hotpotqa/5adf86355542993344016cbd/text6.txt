The NRL All Stars team was a rugby league football team made up of professional players in the National Rugby League.
 These players were selected by fan vote.
 However, fans were only allowed to select one player from each NRL team to join the Australian rugby league team captain and the New Zealand national rugby league team captain.
 Two other players were selected by the NRL All Stars coach.
 This team played in the annual NRL All Stars Game against the Indigenous All Stars.
 They were replaced in 2016 by a World All Stars.
