The West Wales Raiders Rugby League Club previously known as Raiders RL are the most established Rugby league club in West Wales formed in January 2015.
 They are based at Stebonheath Park in Llanelli.
 Formerly called Gwendreath Valley Raiders they moved to Llanelli when the club gained entry into the Conference League South which is level 4 of the Rugby League system.
 in addition to being a local club the raiders are more proactive than some of their professional counterparts by visiting all the local schools delivering rugby league training to pupils.
 They also have links with one of the oldest university rugby league teams in Wales the Warpigs from Swansea University.
 The raiders have taken over the running and coaching of the university rugby league team since 2017.
