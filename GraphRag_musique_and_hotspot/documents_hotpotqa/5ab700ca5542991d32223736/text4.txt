The Ben Maller Show is a sports radio talk show that currently airs on Fox Sports Radio during the hours of 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM ET that is hosted by the Legendary Ben Maller.
 The current edition of the Ben Maller Show debuted on January 6, 2014, after the announcement of a shake-up in the on-air broadcasting lineup.
 It was announced that with JT The Brick's promotion, the supporting cast of his former slot would be staying on the time slot and thus joining Maller.
 The supporting cast consists of Eddie Garcia (update anchor/sidekick), Justin Cooper (Coopa-loop) (executive producer) and Danny G. (technical producer).
 Maller's previous producer Justin Cooper would be staying with Maller's old slot and thus working with Brian Noe and "The Noe Show" which currently airs in Maller's time slot during the weekend.
