The Lakeside Press Building is a historic commercial building located at 731 S. Plymouth Ct. in downtown Chicago, Illinois.
 The building served as a showroom, office, and printing press for the Lakeside Press.
 The building was built in two stages; the southern half was completed in 1897, while the northern half was finished in 1901.
 Architect Howard Van Doren Shaw designed the building, his first design of a commercial building.
 Shaw's design features limestone quoins, piers, and decorations, curtain walls with cast iron spandrels on the floors housing the printing presses, and a projecting cornice.
