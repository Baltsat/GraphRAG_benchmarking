The Parachute murder is a name the Belgian media gave the 2010 Belgian love triangle skydiving murder trial.
 The defendant, elementary school teacher and amateur skydiver Els 'Babs' Clottemans, was found guilty of murder by sabotaging the parachutes of another woman, fellow skydiver Els Van Doren, because Van Doren was a rival for the love of Marcel Somers, also a skydiver.
 The skydive in which Van Doren died occurred on November 18, 2006.
 Van Doren, who was a 38 years old married mother of two and a very experienced skydiver, died when both her primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy.
 The dive was captured by a video camera mounted on Van Doren's helmet.
 Van Doren dropped from a height of over 2 mi landing in a garden in the town of Opglabbeek.
 Police later established that the cords of the parachute had been cut.
