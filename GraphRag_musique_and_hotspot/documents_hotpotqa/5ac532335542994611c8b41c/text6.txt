Deerpath Hill Estates is a residential development in western Lake Forest, Illinois.
 Developer Henry K. Turnbull and architect Stanley D. Anderson planned and built the original development in 1926.
 Turnbull and Anderson designed the development according to the principles of the City Beautiful Movement and the ideas of Howard Van Doren Shaw, Anderson's mentor.
 The individual houses were designed in popular revivalist styles, including English Tudor, Colonial, and French Norman.
 The development was the first in Lake Forest to be planned and controlled entirely by its developer.
