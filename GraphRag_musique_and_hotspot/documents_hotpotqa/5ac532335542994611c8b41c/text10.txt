Camp-Woods, is a historic estate with associated buildings located at Villanova, Delaware County, Pennsylvania and built on a 400' high spot which had been a 200-man outpost of George Washington's Army during the Valley Forge winter of 1777-8.
 The house, built between 1910 and 1912 for banker James M. Willcox, is a two-story, brick and limestone, "F"-shaped house in an Italianate-Georgian style.
 It measures 160 feet in length and 32 feet deep at the "waist."
 It has a slate roof, Doric order limestone cornice, open loggia porches, and a covered entrance porch supported by Doric order columns.
 The house was designed by noted architect Howard Van Doren Shaw (1869-1926).
 The property includes formal gardens.
 Its former carriage house is no longer part of the main estate.
 The original tennis court is now also a separate property named "Outpost Hill".
 The Revolutionary encampment is marked by a flagpole in a circular stone monument at the north-western edge of the property.
 The inscription reads, "An outpost of George Washington's Army encamped here thro the winter of Valley Forge 1777-1778".
