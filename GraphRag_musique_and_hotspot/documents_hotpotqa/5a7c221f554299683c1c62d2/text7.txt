Dublin Pond or Dublin Lake is a 236 acre water body located in Cheshire County in southwestern New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Dublin.
 The pond lies at an elevation of 451 m above sea level, near the height of land between the Connecticut River/Long Island Sound watershed to the west and the Merrimack River/Gulf of Maine watershed to the east.
 Water from Dublin Pond flows west through a series of lakes into Minnewawa Brook, a tributary of the Ashuelot River, which flows to the Connecticut River at Hinsdale, New Hampshire.
 New Hampshire Route 101, a two-lane highway, runs along the northern shore of the lake, and the town center of Dublin is less than one mile to the east.
