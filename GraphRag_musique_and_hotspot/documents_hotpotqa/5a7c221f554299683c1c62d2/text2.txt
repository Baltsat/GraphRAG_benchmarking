The town hall of Winchester, New Hampshire, is located on Main Street, just south of the junction of New Hampshire Route 10 and New Hampshire Route 119 in the center of the town.
 Built of brick in 1911-12 to a design by S. Winthrop St. Clair, it is the only Gothic Revival town hall in Cheshire County.
 It was built because the previous town meeting house (a combination town hall and church at the site of the Winchester Memorial Church) was destroyed by fire.
 The church was also designed by St. Clair, a Boston-based architect who hailed from Winchester.
