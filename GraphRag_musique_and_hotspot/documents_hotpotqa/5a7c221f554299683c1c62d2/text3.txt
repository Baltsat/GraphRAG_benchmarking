The Jaffrey Center Historic District encompasses the traditional civic heart of the small town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire.
 The district lies to the west of the Jaffrey's main business district, extending along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 124) from Harkness Road to the Jaffrey Common, and along Thorndike Pond Road northward from Main Street.
 The district retains the feel of an 18th-19th century rural village, and includes elements dating to shortly after the town's incorporation in 1773.
 The old burying ground was established in 1774, and the old meeting house (now a cultural center) was raised in 1775.
 The district includes 19th century school houses, and houses that were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, in predominantly Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles.
 One of the town's early industries is also represented, in the remnants of a tannery established c. 1810 at the east end of the district.
