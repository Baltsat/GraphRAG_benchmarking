The Gnome 7 Omega (commonly called the Gnome 50 hp) is a French seven-cylinder, air-cooled aero engine produced by Gnome et Rhône.
 It was shown at the Paris Aero Salon held in December 1908 and was first flown in 1909.
 It was the world's first aviation rotary engine produced in quantity.
 Its introduction revolutionized the aviation industry and it was used by many early aircraft.
 It produced 50 horsepower (37 kW) from its capacity of 8 litres (488 cubic inches).
 A Gnome Omega engine powers the 1912 Blackburn Monoplane, owned and operated by the Shuttleworth Collection, the oldest known airworthy British-designed aeroplane worldwide.
 A two-row version of the same engine was also produced, known as the Gnome 14 Omega-Omega or Gnome 100 hp.
 The prototype Omega engine still exists, and is on display at the United States' National Air and Space Museum.
