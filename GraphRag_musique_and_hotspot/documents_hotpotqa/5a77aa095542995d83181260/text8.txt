Robert Henry Widmer (May 17, 1916 â€“ June 20, 2011) was an American aeronautical engineer who specialized in designing aircraft for the military.
 He spent his career working for Convair which became General Dynamics, then Lockheed, and then Lockheed Martin.
 His feisty personality and at times insubordinate attitude at one time led company leaders to strongly consider firing him.
 However, his brilliance at envisioning and designing desirable aircraft years before there was even a market for them led to his appointment as Vice President for science and engineering for all of General Dynamics.
