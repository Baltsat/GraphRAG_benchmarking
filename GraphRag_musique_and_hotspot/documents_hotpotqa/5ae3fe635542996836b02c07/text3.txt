The 61st Cavalry Division was a cavalry division of the Red Army that served in the first years of the Great Patriotic War.
 It was formed in September â€“ October, 1941, and saw its first actions to the south of Stalingrad during the German siege of that city in the autumn of 1942.
 When the Soviet counteroffensive, Operation Uranus, began in November the 61st formed a significant part of the mobile forces of its 51st Army.
 After the positions of Romanian 4th Army were broken through the division took part in the exploitation to the southwest, but became overextended and vulnerable to the mobile German reinforcements arriving to attempt a breakthrough to their Sixth Army.
 The 61st suffered such severe losses that it had to be withdrawn to the reserves in December, and was later disbanded.
