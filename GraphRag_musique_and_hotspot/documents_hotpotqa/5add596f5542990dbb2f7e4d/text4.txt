Paris is a British sitcom produced by Talkback Productions for Channel 4.
 It was written jointly by Irish writers Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, best known for their later sitcom Father Ted.
 The show only lasted one series consisting of six episodes in October and November 1994.
 It featured the escapades of French artist Alain Degout living in 1920s Paris, who wants to be famous, but his work gets him nowhere.
 Unlike BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo, which was also set in France, featuring characters speaking in French accents, the characters of Paris spoke in an English accent.
