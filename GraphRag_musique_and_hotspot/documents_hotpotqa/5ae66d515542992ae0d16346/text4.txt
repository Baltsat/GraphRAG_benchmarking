Ghost is a Swedish record producing and songwriting team, composed of Ulf Lindström and Johan Ekhé, based in New York City.
 They are perhaps best known for writing and producing Swedish singer Robyn's three first studio albums, "Robyn Is Here" (1996), "My Truth" (1999), and "Don't Stop the Music" (2002).
 Robyn's "Keep This Fire Burning" from 2003 was the fourth most played song by Swedish songwriters on Swedish radio from 2000–2009.
 It was later covered by British soul singer Beverley Knight.
