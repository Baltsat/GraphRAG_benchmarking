"Keep This Fire Burning" is a song by Swedish pop singer Robyn, released as the first single from her third album "Don't Stop the Music".
 It was released in Sweden on September 21, 2002, where it became her highest charting single since 1995's "Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)".
 The song was also released as a single in Australia under the name "By Your Side", due to the Australian bush fires which were happening at the time.
 In 2008, a re-recorded version of the song appeared on the special edition of Robyn's eponymous album.
