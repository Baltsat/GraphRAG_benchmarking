The Episcopal presence in Canandaigua,New York begins about 1799 with the St. Matthew Society, a missionary group.
 St. John's Episcopal Church was organized in 1814 and first met in the Ontario County, New York Court House in Canandaigua.
 St. John's erected a wooden church building in 1816.
 Bishop John Henry Hobart consecrated it that year.
 The brick rectory was constructed alongside the church in 1851.
 Steady congregational growth necessitated more space.
 This led to the razing of the first church and the constructing of the current, larger stone Gothic building done in the parish church style popular in the 19th century.
 Emlen T. Littel of New York, who was also the architect of Zion Episcopal Church (Palmyra, New York) designed the building.
 This church was constructed in 1872 at a cost of $47,000 (approximately $850,000 today) and consecrated in 1886.
 It contains several windows from the earlier wooden church, elaborate new stained glass windows imported from Europe, and one—The Parables Window—was designed by Daniel Cottier(1837–1891), who was considered an important influence on Louis Comfort Tiffany.
 In 1908, new hardwood floors, choir stalls, and an organ were installed.
 The parish house and a chapel were added at the same time.
 In 1964-65, an addition to parish house included classrooms, a new chapel, and a dining/ meeting room added to celebrate the church’s 150th anniversary.
 Recent additions include a columbarium with a capacity of 136 niches and a memorial garden, outside the church, reached through the columbarium and chapel in the south transept.
