Short Back 'n' Sides is the fifth solo album of Ian Hunter.
 Unsure of which direction he should take, Ian Hunter finally decided to collaborate with Mick Jones, who gave Hunter's songs a tougher and heavier touch.
 Fellow Clash member Topper Headon as well as Mick Ronson, Todd Rundgren and Ellen Foley also appeared on this album.
