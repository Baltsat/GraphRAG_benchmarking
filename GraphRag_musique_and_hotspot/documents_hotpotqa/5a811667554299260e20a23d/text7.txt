Veronica Mars is the fictional protagonist, occasional narrator (through voiceovers), and antiheroine of the American television series "Veronica Mars", which aired on UPN from 2004 to 2006 and on The CW from 2006 to 2007.
 The character was portrayed by Kristen Bell through the duration of the series.
 Following the show's cancellation, Bell reprised the role in the 2014 film continuation.
 The character, created by Rob Thomas, was originally male and the protagonist of his unproduced novel "Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel", which eventually became the basis of the series.
 After the work's transition from novel to television series, Thomas changed the character's gender from male to female as he believed a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting.
