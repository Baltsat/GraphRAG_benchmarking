In the Canadian cabinet, the President of The Queen's Privy Council for Canada (French: "President du Conseil priv√© de la Reine pour le Canada" ) is nominally in charge of the Privy Council Office.
 The President of the Privy Council also has the largely ceremonial duty of presiding over meetings of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, a body which only convenes in full for affairs of state such as the accession of a new Sovereign or the marriage of the Prince of Wales or heir presumptive to the Throne (see Monarchy in Canada).
 Accordingly, the last time the President of the Privy Council had to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council was in 1981 on the occasion of Charles, Prince of Wales' engagement to Lady Diana Spencer.
 It is the equivalent of the office of Lord President of the Council in the United Kingdom.
