In the United Kingdom, the Accession Council is a ceremonial body which assembles in St James's Palace upon the death of a monarch (Demise of the Crown), to formally proclaim the accession of his or her successor to the throne.
 Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically.
 The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the heir who has succeeded.
