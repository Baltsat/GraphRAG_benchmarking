The Pollokshields Burgh Hall stands at the edge of Maxwell Park, Glasgow, Scotland.
 Designed by Henry Edward Clifford and constructed in 17th-century Scottish Baronial style, this was opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell as a Masonic Meeting Place and for the use of the community but served the independent burgh of Pollokshields only until 1891 when the rapidly expanding city swallowed up the area.
 The hall contained various council offices and a courtroom.
 It continues to this day as a Masonic meeting place, hence the numerous Masonic symbols in the carvings (especially at the back of the building) and in the stained-glass windows.
