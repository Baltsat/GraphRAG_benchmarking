The Great Hall of the People is a state building located at the western edge of Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
 It is used for legislative and ceremonial activities by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government and the ruling Communist Party of China.
 The Great Hall functions as the meeting place for the full sessions of the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), which occurs every year during March along with the national session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body.
 It is also the meeting place of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which, since 1982, has occurred once every five years.
