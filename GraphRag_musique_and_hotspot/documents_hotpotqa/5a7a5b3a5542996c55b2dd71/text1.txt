Warriparinga (meaning "Windy Place" in the local Kaurna language) is a nature reserve comprising 3.5 ha in the metropolitan suburb of Bedford Park, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia.
 It has historical, cultural and environmental significance as a traditional Kaurna ceremonial meeting place and as a site of early European settlement.
 Also known as Fairford, Laffer's Triangle and the Sturt Triangle, Warriparinga is bordered by Marion Road, Sturt Road and South Road, and is traversed by the Sturt River as it exists from Sturt Gorge to travel west across the Adelaide Plains.
