Flight 15P of SpaceShipOne (X0) was the first privately funded human spaceflight.
 It took place on June 21, 2004.
 It was the fourth powered test flight of the Tier One program, the previous three test flights having reached much lower altitudes.
 The flight carried only its pilot, Mike Melvill, who thus became the first non-governmental astronaut.
