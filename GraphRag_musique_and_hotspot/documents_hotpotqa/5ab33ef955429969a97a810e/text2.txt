Project Highwater was an experiment carried out as part of two of the test flights of NASA's Saturn I launch vehicle (using battleship upper stages), successfully launched into a sub-orbital trajectory from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
 The Highwater experiment sought to determine the effect of a large volume of water suddenly released into the ionosphere.
 The project answered questions about the effect of the diffusion of propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude.
