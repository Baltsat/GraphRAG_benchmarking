The Sprite was a British rocket engine built by de Havilland for use in RATO (Rocket-assisted take off) applications.
 For RATO use only a short burn time is required, with simplicity and light weight as major virtues.
 The intended market was for assisting take-off of de Havilland Comet 1 airliners (as hot and high operations in the British Empire were considered important) and also for V bombers carrying heavy nuclear weapons.
 30 successful test flights were carried out by Comets, from May 1951, but gas turbine performance improved rapidly, and so RATO was not required in service.
