Having grown up in a laboratory, Damian Wayne as a pre-adolescent is left by his mother in the care of his father, who had been unaware of his son's existence. He is violent and self - important and was trained by the League of Assassins, learning to kill at a young age, which troubles the relationship with his father, who refuses to kill. However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny. After the events of Batman R.I.P. and Batman: Battle for the Cowl, he takes the role of Robin at ten years of age, becoming the fifth person to use the Robin persona. He first worked with Dick Grayson before going to work alongside his father, upon the original's return to the role of Batman. He continued to serve as Robin until 2013's Batman, Inc. # 8, in which he is killed by the Heretic, an agent of his mother and his own artificially - aged clone. In 2014's Batman and Robin vol. 2, # 37, Batman resurrects Damian Wayne.
