There he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet. The Brillouin family returned to Saint-Martin-l\u00e8s-Melle during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to escape the fighting. There he spent time teaching himself from his grandfather's philosophy books. After the war, he returned to Paris and entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1874 and graduated in 1878. He became a physics assistant to Eleuthere Mascart (his future father-in-law) at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, while at the same time working for his doctorates in mathematics and physics, which he gained in 1880 and 1882, respectively. Brillouin then held successive posts as assistant professor of physics at universities in Nancy, Dijon and Toulouse before returning to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1888. Later, he was Professor of Mathematical Physics at the Coll\u00e8ge de France from 1900 to retirement in 1931.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3:70b-instruct-q6_K", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
