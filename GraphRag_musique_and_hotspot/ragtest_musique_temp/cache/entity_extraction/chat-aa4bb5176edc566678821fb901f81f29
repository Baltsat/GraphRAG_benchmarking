Much to her chagrin, Dr Koracik brings to light how impaired her judgment has been over the last ten years; Richard makes sure to let Amelia know that her judgment has n't been all that bad and encourages her to come clean to those with whom she's closest. Bailey is confronted by Harper Avery about all the changes that have been made to the hospital and threatens to withdraw all funding from the foundation; when Bailey stands up to him, Avery fires her. In the end of the episode Avery passes away with a sudden cardiac arrest and then Jackson and Catherine Avery reinstate Bailey back as the chief. Ben and Arizona resort to advice delivered by Carina when one of their patients gets stuck in labor. Meredith turns to her former psychiatrist, who winds up as a patient, to sort out her mood towards everyone instigated by the love triangle involving Nathan and Megan.
