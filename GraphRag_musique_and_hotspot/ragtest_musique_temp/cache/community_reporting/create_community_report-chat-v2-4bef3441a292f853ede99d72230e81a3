The Royal Australian Navy operated HMAS Samuel Benbow, while the United States Navy commissioned several ships, including the USS Admirable (AM-136), USS Brooklyn (CL-40), USS Catbird, USS Chanticleer, and USS Rhodes (DE-384). These ships played a significant role in military operations, serving as convoy escorts, providing fire support for amphibious landings, and participating in other naval activities. Additionally, the Crosley-class high speed transport ships and the 'Elizabeth C. Stanton' class transport ship were also involved during this period.
